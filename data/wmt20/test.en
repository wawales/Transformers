So, while it may not be necessary to employ measures now to prevent harm in the future, it makes sense to identify which measures might be needed, together with the changes in social norms and behaviors that might be required to implement them.
Many of the risks from evolutionary engineering are triggered by bad parental decision-making.
Eager to give their children social advantages, parents may make reproductive decisions based on faulty or incomplete genetic information, or seek genetic alteration of their offspring before adequate safety testing has been carried out.
Determining when it is permissible to interfere with parental choices is challenging, given the deference that parents typically receive.
Most countries have laws aimed at protecting children from abuse and neglect.
But legislation to safeguard children’s welfare does not adequately address harms produced or set in motion before birth, or establish which types of evolutionary engineering are acceptable.
Most of the reproductive decisions parents make cannot be carried out without the aid of professionals such as physicians, so it might be necessary to regulate professional behavior as well.
While some of the infrastructure, such as licensure laws for physicians, is already in place, additional steps may be needed, such as heightened regulation of infertility clinics, where many genetic-engineering interventions will take place.
Furthermore, rules must be established for assessing the safety and effectiveness of new technologies with respect both to immediate recipients and their descendants.
Some forms of evolutionary engineering that do not directly harm individuals, and therefore would not be subject to such regulations, such as decisions by all parents to make the same genetic changes in their offspring, could threaten the survival of the human lineage.
Public-health systems could respond to this concern.
Yet, in view of past efforts by officials to employ genetics to improve public health – most notably, the early-twentieth-century eugenics movement, with its appalling forced sterilization campaigns – it is important to ensure that such power is wielded judiciously and on the basis of sound science.
Finally, if too few members of society enjoy too great a genetic advantage, social cohesion and democratic institutions could be threatened even in the absence of any direct physical harm.
If the genetic engineering that we allow is to benefit our descendants, it must be as widely available as possible.
Genetic Property Rights on Trial
LONDON – In early February 2010, a United States federal district court in New York began deciding a landmark case as to whether individuals have a “right to know” about how their own genomes can dictate their future health.
The case, American Civil Liberties Union v. Myriad Genetics , may have a tremendous impact on medicine and science.
The questions on which the case turns are whether genetic patents help or hamper research, and whether patients should have to pay a license fee to a biotechnology corporation to be tested for predisposition to disease.
One of the plaintiffs is Lisbeth Ceriani, a 43-year-old woman with breast cancer whose doctors recommended that she be tested for two genetic mutations involved in some hereditary forms of the disease.
Myriad Genetics, the sole test provider in the US – it holds a patent on the genes themselves , not just on the diagnostic test – did not accept her insurance, and Ceriani could not afford to pay for the test.
So she remained ignorant, as did her physicians – with possible ramifications for her clinical care.
Five other plaintiffs – along with major medical bodies – tell similar stories.
Those who oppose genetic patents claim that they also deny US constitutional rights, making this the first time a genetic patent has been challenged on human rights grounds.
As so often happens in biotechnology, what looks at first like an abstruse technical issue raises many questions that cut to the core of our humanity.
One human gene out of approximately every five is now the subject of a patent, the majority of which are held by private firms.
This case concerns two such genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2.
Women with the “wrong” version of these genes have a heightened risk of developing breast cancer (up to 85%, against the normal 12%, although the genes account for only a minority of breast cancers).
These women also run a greater risk of ovarian cancer.
Myriad Genetics also has tried to pursue patent rights in Europe, but there its claims have been largely rejected.
Although the gene’s function in causing breast and ovarian cancer was uncovered by Cancer Research UK in 1995, Myriad, along with nearly 30 other defendants, argues that the patent is a necessary reward for its research costs.
In fact, without patent protections, the firm and its allies claim, medical research would shudder to a halt.
But, whatever the merits of the claim that genetic patents benefit research and treatment, that is a practical, rather than a legal, argument.
In order to gain legal “standing” to sue Myriad Genetics, critics of genetic patents – including the American Medical Association, the American Society of Human Genetics, and the American Civil Liberties Union – had to find an issue that could be adjudicated on a constitutional basis.
Their innovative strategy is to draw on the First Amendment, which protects freedoms such as speech and religion, to argue that patents restrict patients’ freedom of access to information that might enable us to take action to protect our health.
That is a clever argument, but is it really the source of people’s profound disquiet about genetic patenting?
In talking about similar issues raised in my recent book Body Shopping , I have heard many shocked reactions to the growing commodification of human tissue, but none more generally shared than this one: how can you take out a patent on life?
Is a genetic variant a “product of nature” or a “discovery”?
While the plaintiffs assert that “genes are identified, not invented,” the defendants claim that the basis of patent law is precisely the opposite.
Their argument is that what is patented is not the gene as it occurs in our bodies, but rather a sort of “cloned” version produced in the laboratory.
Rather than a “patent on life,” the companies say, they are patenting something more like a chemical.
If that is true, how can Ceriani rightfully be kept in the dark about what form the gene takes in her body?
This is not just a problem for people who think – wrongly, in legal terms – that they own their bodies, as most people do.
With a few limited and recent exceptions, there is no such thing as property in tissue once it has left your body.
We know that from such cases as that of John Moore, who tried unsuccessfully to claim property rights in a valuable cell line developed from his immune cells.
But what about a gene that has not left my body?
Don’t I somehow still “own” it?
Don’t I have rights of control over my own body?
How can a commercial firm not only deny me the right to know my own genetic profile unless I pay their fee for the diagnostic test, which might be fair enough, but also to prevent any other firm from offering me a similar test unless those firms pay it a license fee?
Proprietary rights for commercial firms over the most basic element of an individual’s genetic identity should not be enforceable.
We do not have to believe in genetic determinism to find that argument compelling.
The Age of Epigenetics
LONDON – Fifty-one years ago, James Watson, Maurice Wilkins, and Francis Crick were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their discovery of DNA’s structure – a breakthrough that heralded the age of the gene.
Since then, the field of genetics has advanced significantly, particularly as a result of the global Human Genome Project, which in 2003 identified all of the roughly 23,000 genes and three billion chemical base pairs in human DNA in order to screen for many rare diseases.
But, despite evidence that most diseases have a clear genetic component, only a fraction of the genes that explain them have been found.
And scientists in the field remain puzzled by the fact that most identical twins (who share 100% of their genes) do not die from the same diseases.
As a result, many in the scientific community are beginning to predict a decline in the role of the gene in pinpointing the root causes of diseases.
It is too soon to discount genetics, however, because the science of “epigenetics” – the study of mechanisms for turning genes on and off, thus changing the way a cell develops without altering the genetic code – is gaining traction.
Indeed, the 2012 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka for revolutionizing scientists’ understanding of how cells develop by reprogramming DNA and cells without altering their genetic structure.
In 1962, Gurdon’s finding that almost any cell in the body contains the complete DNA code enabled him to create a tadpole by cloning an adult frog.
More than four decades later, in 2006, Yamanaka discovered a way to trick complex adult cells in mice into regressing to their immature state, forming stem cells.
Before this, stem cells – which can potentially be reprogrammed to develop into replacements for lost or damaged tissue – could be taken only from early-stage embryos, a practice that fueled ethical controversy.
The true promise of epigenetics has become apparent only in the last few years, as scientists’ ability to assess the epigenetic mechanisms in DNA – which can now be measured at roughly 30 million points across the human genome – has dramatically improved.
Epigenetics can potentially be used to explain the root causes of many diseases that scientists have so far struggled to understand, from asthma to allergies to autism.
Consider lung cancer.
Six decades ago, when most men smoked, British doctors linked smoking to lung cancer, making it the first disease to be causally linked to smoking.
(In fact, lung cancer kills one in ten smokers.)
But the incidence of certain kinds of lung cancer continues to rise – particularly in women – making it one of the most prolific killers worldwide, despite the general decline of smoking over the last 30 years.
Indeed, nowadays, many lung cancer patients have no history of smoking.
These “blameless” patients seem to develop a different kind of lung cancer from those who report a history of smoking – one that is more responsive to new medications and has better, albeit still poor, outcomes.
Epigenetic processes that cause key anti-cancer genes, such as the tumor suppressor P16, to be switched off could explain the increased prevalence of lung cancer.
A recent study showed that a few years of smoking can have this effect, making smokers more susceptible to a variety of cancers.
My team and I recently studied 36 pairs of identical twins, of which only one twin had breast cancer.
These “genetic clones” had a few crucial differences.
In the twin who developed the breast cancer, several hundred genes had been switched off.
In a few genes, this had occurred five years before diagnosis.
Such findings unlock the possibility of a diagnostic test well before the disease manifests itself, and of developing drugs that prevent – or even reverse – the cancer’s development.
Moreover, animal studies have shown that changes in stress or diet can alter the behavior and genes of future generations.
As a result, it is likely that epigenetic changes can be inherited.
For example, smoking could have caused epigenetic changes in a grandparent’s DNA, effectively switching off certain anti-cancer genes.
The genes would then be passed down to descendants in this switched-off state.
Thus, the toxins that people ingest may not be the only relevant factor should cancer strike; the toxins that their parents or grandparents ingested could also be to blame.
Physical experiments revealing such trans-generational effects are impossible to conduct on humans, so historical or observational data must be used.
One study of children in Bristol showed differences in growth depending on whether their grandfathers had smoked before the age of 11.
Their bodies probably reacted defensively, adapting in the short term by changing the genes for the next few generations, or until the “danger” had passed, a so-called “soft inheritance” running in parallel to slower-acting evolutionary forces.
Fortunately, these epigenetic changes are potentially reversible.
Four epigenetic leukemia drugs, which aim to switch the natural protective genes back on, are now on the market in the United States.
More than 40 other epigenetic drugs are being developed, not only for cancer, but also for obesity and even dementia.
In the future, regular epigenetic health check-ups could become standard practice.
More than 50 years on, genes remain crucial to understanding complex diseases – especially given scientists’ ever-improving ability to alter them.
The age of the gene is far from over; it has simply progressed into the age of epigenetics.
Harnessing the Genomics Revolution
CAMBRIDGE – Just 13 years after the successful completion of the Human Genome Project, the power of genomics applications to spur innovation is already becoming apparent.
Indeed, though the genomics revolution is just getting underway, it is becoming a transformative agent in the global economy – one that promises to bring far-reaching social and environmental benefits.
In the United States alone, the $3.8 billion in public funds invested in the Human Genome Project has already generated close to $1 trillion in economic returns and more than 300,000 jobs.
According to the OECD, genomics will become a central component of many economic sectors, including health care, the environment, agriculture, animal health, biotechnology, alternative energy, forensics, justice, and security.
With the pace of innovation continuing to accelerate, this prediction will likely be fulfilled even sooner than anticipated.
The area where genomics-driven innovations have attracted the most attention is health.
Rapid progress toward truly “personalized medicine” is occurring, with patients’ DNA profiles being translated into more individualized, predictive, and preventive medical care.
Already, studies to identify genes associated with common diseases – including some that represent significant health, economic, and social burdens, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity – are beginning to enable doctors to use patient DNA information to inform clinical care.
And researchers are identifying genetic variations that influence the effects of drugs, allowing safer and more effective administration of medication to manage pain and treat some cancers, as well as cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases.
Taking these developments a step further, the Precision Medicine Initiative, launched in the US last year, is pursuing innovative trials of targeted drugs for adult and pediatric cancers, introducing customized combination therapies, and honing its understanding of drug resistance.
In the longer term, the project aims to create a research cohort of more than a million volunteers whose shared genetic data, biological samples, and lifestyle information will form the foundation for precision medicine in a large number of human diseases.
But health care is far from the only area influenced by the genomics-driven revolution.
There have been game-changing developments in other fields as well, many with proven potential to help address global challenges, such as ensuring food security and safeguarding the environment in the face of a rapidly growing global population, expected to reach 9.6 billion in 35 years.
Selection of high-value traits using genomics is giving farmers, and the food industry in general, the tools to produce more and better foods.
Rice crops in Southeast Asia, for example, can now be flood-resistant.
Beef, dairy, and swine herds produce higher output.
The burgeoning fishery and aquaculture sector is benefiting from species with better yields and greater resistance to disease and stress.
Moreover, by providing detailed information on biodiversity and the interactions within ecosystems, genomics is driving the development of innovative environmental-protection strategies.
Forests are a prime example.
By broadening our understanding of commercially valuable traits, such as insect resistance, wood quality, growth rates, and adaptation to climate change, genomics has helped to improve the sustainability of tree breeding and forest management.
Canadian and Chinese researchers are also using genomic analysis of the microbial communities living in hydrocarbon deposits to develop new bioprocesses that will make oil and gas extraction greener, by enhancing resource recovery, reducing water and energy use, and minimizing greenhouse-gas emissions.
The promise of genomics is seemingly limitless.
But if that promise is to be fulfilled, major challenges must be overcome.
In health care, in particular, we need to continue generating solid evidence of the value of moving personalized medicine into routine practice.
Furthermore, rigorous economic analyses are needed to guide policies on health-care coverage and reimbursement.
Above all, important questions surrounding patient privacy, technology access, reporting of incidental findings, discrimination, and counseling must be answered, so that thoughtful and forward-looking public policies can be devised.
To this end, mechanisms to ensure broad public discussion and participation must be strengthened.
Even at this early stage, it is clear that genomics is set to transform science and technology and sustain a wave of far-reaching innovation.
Now is the time for countries and regions to embrace genomics research and technologies, and to start translating them into effective solutions to major global, regional, and local challenges.
The Geography of Elections
PARIS – In many countries, where you live tends to be an accurate predictor of what or whom you are voting for.
This was most evident in the maps of the electoral geography of voting for “Leave” and “Remain” in the United Kingdom’s June referendum on European Union membership.
A similar pattern can be found in the distribution of votes in the 2012 US presidential election or in French support for Marine Le Pen’s National Front in the 2015 regional elections.
It is very likely to be found in the United States’ upcoming presidential election.
Many citizens live in places where a large share of their neighbors vote the same way they do.
This voting geography is indicative of a deep economic, social, and educational divide.
Affluent cities, where university graduates concentrate, tend to vote for internationally-minded, often center-left candidates, while lower middle-class and working-class districts tend to vote for trade-adverse candidates, often from the nationalist right.
It is no accident that mayors from the center-left govern New York, London, Paris, and Berlin, whereas smaller, struggling cities tend to prefer hard-right politicians.
Regional or local voting patterns are as old as democracy.
What is new is a growing correlation of spatial, social, and political polarization that is turning fellow citizens into near-strangers.
As Enrico Moretti of the University of California at Berkeley emphasized in his book The New Geography of Jobs, the salience of this new divide is unmistakable: university graduates account for half of the total population in the most affluent US metropolitan areas, but are four times less numerous in worse-off areas.
Economic shocks tend to exacerbate this political divide.
Those who happen to live and work in traditional manufacturing districts caught in the turmoil of globalization are multiple losers: their jobs, their housing wealth, and the fortunes of their children and relatives are all highly correlated.
In fascinating new research, MIT’s David Autor and his co-authors have explored the political consequences.
They find that US districts where the economy was severely hit by Chinese exports have responded by replacing moderate representatives with more radical politicians – either from the left or the right.
Globalization, therefore, has resulted in both economic and political polarization.
For too long, governments have neglected this divide.
Some put faith in trickle-down economics, others in a monetary-policy-driven revival of growth and employment, and still others in fiscal redistribution.
But these solutions have delivered little respite.
Evidence speaks against the naive hope that prosperity will eventually reach all areas.
Modern economic development relies heavily on interactions, which in turn require a high density of firms, skills, and innovators.
It puts a premium on agglomeration, which is why larger cities tend to thrive, while smaller cities struggle.
Once an area has started losing skills and firms, there is little hope that the trend will naturally reverse.
Being without a job can quickly become the new normal.
Aggregate demand expansion hardly alleviates the pain.
Even if it remains true that a rising tide lifts all boats, it does not do so in an even way.
For those who feel left out, stronger national growth often means even more prosperity and dynamism in the better-off cities, and little, if any, gain for themselves – hence a sharper, even more unbearable divide.
Growth itself has become divisive.
And whereas fiscal transfers help counter inequality and fight poverty, they do little to repair the social fabric.
Furthermore, their long-term sustainability is increasingly in doubt.
In her inaugural address, British Prime Minister Theresa May committed herself to a “unionist” approach to the country’s economic and social woes.
US presidential candidates have also rediscovered the strength of the demand for national and social cohesion.
Similar concerns will no doubt be raised in the coming French presidential campaign.
Yet, if the ends are clear, politicians are often clueless about the means.
In the US presidential campaign, trade protection is fashionable again.
But, while import restrictions may alleviate the pain of some manufacturing districts, they will not prevent companies from relocating where growth opportunities are the strongest.
They will not protect workers from technological change.
And they will not recreate yesterday’s development patterns.
Most prominently in the UK, but elsewhere as well, economic migration is increasingly being called into question.
But here, too, while restricting the entry of Eastern European workers may alleviate wage competition or stem the rise in housing prices, it will not change the relative fate of small and big cities.
Rather than claiming the opposite, politicians should acknowledge that there are no quick fixes to the uneven geography of modern economic development.
Inconvenient as it may be, the rise of the metropolis is a fact – one that should not be resisted, because it is not a zero-sum game.
Big cities do yield aggregate economic benefits.
What public policy must do is ensure that economic agglomeration does not threaten equality of opportunity.
Governments cannot decide where companies locate; but it is their responsibility to ensure that, although where you live affects your income, where you were born does not determine your future.
In other words, public policy has a major responsibility in limiting the correlation between geography and social mobility.
As Raj Chetty of Stanford and others have shown, this is far from being the case in the US, and similar patterns can be observed in other countries.
Infrastructure can help.
Efficient transportation, quality health services, and broadband Internet access can help smaller cities attract investment in sectors that do not rely on agglomeration effects.
Back-office services, for example, may have an advantage in being located where office space and housing are cheap.
Finally, there is a case for limiting the selfishness of better-off areas.
The distribution of competences between national and subnational levels, as well as the structure of taxation, was defined in a very different environment.
To mitigate the geo-economic divide, they may have to be rethought fundamentally.
The Global Economy Confronts Four Geopolitical Risks
CAMBRIDGE – The end of the year is a good time to consider the risks that lie ahead of us.
There are of course important economic risks, including the mispricing of assets caused by a decade of ultra-low interest rates, the shifts in demand caused by the Chinese economy’s changing structure, and European economies’ persistent weakness.
But the main longer-term risks are geopolitical, stemming from four sources: Russia, China, the Middle East, and cyberspace.
Although the Soviet Union no longer exists, Russia remains a formidable nuclear power, with the ability to project force anywhere in the world.
Russia is also economically weak because of its dependence on oil revenue at a time when prices are down dramatically.
President Vladimir Putin has already warned Russians that they face austerity, because the government will no longer be able to afford the transfer benefits that it provided in recent years.
The geopolitical danger arises from Putin’s growing reliance on military action abroad – in Ukraine and now in Syria – to maintain his popularity at home, using the domestic media (now almost entirely under Kremlin control) to extol Russia’s global importance.
Russia also uses its gas exports to Western Europe and Turkey as an economic weapon, although Turkey’s recent decision to source gas from Israel shows the limits of this strategy.
As Putin responds to this and other challenges, Russia will remain a source of substantial uncertainty for the rest of the world.
China is still a poor country, with per capita GDP at roughly a quarter of the US level (on the basis of purchasing power parity).
But, because its population is four times larger, its total GDP is equal to America’s (in PPP terms).
And it is total GDP that determines a country’s ability to spend on military power, to provide a strategically significant market for other countries’ exports, and to offer aid to other parts of the world.
China is doing all of these things on a scale commensurate with its GDP.
Looking ahead, even with the more moderate growth rates projected for the future, China’s GDP will grow more rapidly than that of the US or Europe.
China is now expanding its strategic reach.
It is asserting maritime claims in the East and South China Seas that conflict with claims by other countries in the region (including Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam).
In particular, China is relying on the so-called “nine-dash line” (originally created by Taiwan in 1947) to justify its claim to most of the South China Sea, where it has created artificial islands and asserted sovereignty over their surrounding waters.
The US characterizes China’s policy as “anti-access area denial”: an effort to keep the US Navy far from the Chinese mainland and therefore from the coasts of America’s allies in the region.
China also is expanding its geopolitical influence through initiatives like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, aid programs in Africa, and its “One Belt, One Road” plan to establish maritime and territorial links through the Indian Ocean and Central Asia, extending all the way to Europe.
The current Chinese political leadership wants a peaceful and cooperative relationship with the US and other Western countries.
But, looking to the future, the challenge for the US and its allies will be to deter future generations of Chinese leaders from adopting policies that threaten the West.
In the Middle East, much of the world’s focus has been on the threat posed by ISIS to civilian populations everywhere – including Europe and the United States.
But the bigger issue in the region is the conflict between Shia and Sunni Muslims, a divide that has persisted for more than a thousand years.
For most of that time, and in most places, the Shia have faced discrimination – and often lethal violence – at the hands of Sunnis.
Thus, Saudi Arabia and other Sunni-ruled Gulf states view Iran, the region’s Shia power, as their strategic nemesis.
Saudi Arabia, in particular, fears that Iran wants to settle old scores and attempt to shift custodianship of Islam’s holy sites in Mecca and Medina to Shia control.
A conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran would also be a fight over the vast oil riches of the Arabia Peninsula and the enormous financial wealth of small Sunni states like Kuwait and Qatar.
The final source of risk, cyberspace, may soon overshadow all the rest, because borders and armies cannot limit it.
The threats include denial-of-service attacks on banks and other institutions; unauthorized access to personal records from banks, insurance companies, and government agencies; and industrial espionage.
Indeed, widespread theft of technology from US companies led to a recent agreement between China and the US that neither government will assist in stealing technology to benefit its country’s firms.
These are important issues, but not nearly as serious as the threat that malware poses to critical infrastructure – electricity grids, air traffic systems, oil pipelines, water supplies, financial platforms, and so on.
Recent cases of malware use have been attributed to China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea.
But states need not be involved at all: Individuals and non-state actors could deploy malware simply by hiring the needed talent in the international underground marketplace.
Cyber weapons are relatively cheap (and thus widely accessible) and capable of reaching anywhere in the world.
They are the future weapons of choice for attacking or blackmailing an adversary.
And we still lack the ability to block such attacks or to identify unambiguously their sources.
These four sources of risk constitute an unusually serious set of geopolitical challenges.
By highlighting them, I don’t mean to downplay the importance of other issues – US monetary policy, weak commodity prices, debt crises, and the like – that are likely to affect the global economy in the year ahead.
What’s special about the threats emanating from Russia, China, the Middle East, and cyberspace is that they will persist and threaten our economic future for years to come.
Last Man Standing
LONDON – Much of modern geopolitics seems to be following the plot from Game of Thrones, with many countries under so much political and economic stress that their only hope is that their rivals collapse before they do.
So their governments cling to power while exploiting rivals’ internal weaknesses.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is the prime example.
His recent campaigns in Syria and Ukraine may look like the actions of a geopolitical buccaneer.
But the root of his adventurism is domestic weakness.
Russia’s annexation of Crimea, for example, was in large part an attempt to provide Putin’s regime with renewed legitimacy following a winter of discontent, during which demonstrators took to the streets to protest his return to the presidency.
Rival powers – most notably the United States and the European Union – have introduced sanctions in the hope of widening cracks in the Russian elite, exploiting the fact that Putin has not diversified his economy away from oil and gas.
Putin, in turn, is hoping that Russia’s economy stays afloat long enough for Ukraine to collapse.
To hasten that process, the Kremlin has left no lever of destabilization unpulled: It has launched military incursions, manipulated Ukraine’s politics, used energy blackmail, and engaged in information warfare.
Putin believes that the EU suffers from the same flaws as the former Soviet Union, regarding it as a utopian, multinational project that will crumble under the weight of its contradictions.
Here, too, the Kremlin has done its best to help the process along, by supporting far-right parties throughout the EU.
Putin seems to be hoping that if the United Kingdom votes for “Brexit” and the National Front’s Marine Le Pen is elected President of France, the EU will lose its ability to maintain the sanctions.
He hasn’t stopped with Europe.
After Turkish forces shot down a Russian warplane near its border with Syria in November, Putin adopted a series of measures designed to destabilize Turkey from within.
He imposed economic sanctions, spread rumors of corruption in President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s inner circle, invited the leader of a Kurdish party to Moscow, and allegedly sent arms to the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).
The political scientist Ivan Krastev believes that “Putin seems to have dug in for a long-term policy of sapping Turkey’s economy and undermining Erdoğan politically.”
Elsewhere in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia’s monarchy and Iran’s theocracy are in a race for survival.
The Iranian economy is a wreck after years of international sanctions, and the government has not yet managed to take advantage of the nuclear deal it struck with the US to rebuild it.
But it has managed to rally public support by posing as a leader of the world’s Shia Muslims and undermining Saudi Arabia in Iraq, Syria, Bahrain, and Yemen.
Predicting the collapse of the House of Saud has become a mainstay of Middle East commentary.
But Saudi Arabia is betting that it can keep oil prices low enough for long enough to destabilize Iran and put the US shale-energy industry out of business.
The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, has said that he will not cut production even if prices hit $20 a barrel.
“If the price falls, it falls,” he said. “Others will be harmed greatly before we feel any pain.”
Farther east, the Chinese juggernaut is beginning to stumble.
The analyst Minxin Pei speculates that the Chinese Communist Party’s rule may be about to come to an end. “Growth is slowing,” he writes.
“The party is in disarray, because the rules it has established to limit internecine political warfare have collapsed…. Middle-class acquiescence is beginning to erode because of environmental degradation, poor services, inequality, and corruption.”
China’s rulers, for their part, are betting that they can survive a sharp economic slowdown and that the country will outgrow the US, changing the balance of power in Asia.
One reason for President Xi Jinping’s optimism is the dire state of US politics.
For years, Congress has been gridlocked on domestic reforms, and now the world is contemplating the consequences of a victory by Donald Trump in November’s presidential election.
Chinese nationalists hope that the decline of America’s relative power in East Asia will cause it to pull back, as it has from other regions, including the Middle East and Europe.
An article published last month in China’s People’s Daily speculated that a Trump administration would snub key Asian allies such as Japan and South Korea, allowing China to become the dominant military power in the Pacific.
Even if Hillary Clinton wins the election, they think that the American public has lost its appetite for internationalism and that the country will turn its back on free trade and foreign intervention.
Trying to undercut a rival – even at the risk of harming oneself – is a familiar tactic in the world of business, where firms engage in price wars, hoping their competitors will go bust first and exit the industry.
But it has been less common in geopolitics.
In his 1992 book The End of History and the Last Man, Francis Fukuyama argued that the world had reached the end of socioeconomic development.
Liberal democracy, he concluded, was the “last man,” the end point of this development.
He could not have been more wrong.
Today, the world’s great powers are no longer claiming to be the last man; all they can do is hope to be the last man standing.
The World George H.W. Bush Made
CAMBRIDGE – I have worked for four US presidents, Democrats and Republicans alike, and perhaps the most important thing I have learned along the way is that little of what we call history is inevitable.
What happens in this world is the result of what people choose to do and choose not to do when presented with challenges and opportunities.
George H.W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States, was presented with more than his share of challenges and opportunities, and the record is clear: he left the country and the world considerably better off than he found them.
I worked for and often with Bush for all four years of his presidency.
I was the National Security Council member responsible for overseeing the development and execution of policy toward the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, and Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan. I was also brought into a good many other policy deliberations.
Bush was kind, decent, fair, open-minded, considerate, lacking in prejudice, modest, principled, and loyal.
He valued public service and saw himself as simply the latest in the long line of US presidents, another temporary occupant of the Oval Office and custodian of American democracy.
His foreign policy achievements were many and significant, starting with the ending of the Cold War.
To be sure, that it ended when it did had a great deal to do with four decades of concerted Western effort in every region of the world, the defeat of the Soviets in Afghanistan, the deep-seated flaws within the Soviet system, and the words and deeds of Mikhail Gorbachev.
But none of this meant that the Cold War was preordained to end quickly or peacefully.
It did, in part, because Bush was sensitive to Gorbachev’s and later Boris Yeltsin’s predicament and avoided making a difficult situation humiliating.
He was careful not to gloat or to indulge in the rhetoric of triumphalism.
He was widely criticized for this restraint, but he managed not to trigger just the sort of nationalist reaction that we are now seeing in Russia.
He also got what he wanted.
No one should confuse Bush’s caution with timidity.
He overcame the reluctance, and at times objections, of many of his European counterparts and fostered Germany’s unification – and brought it about within NATO.
This was statecraft at its finest.
Bush’s other great foreign policy achievement was the Gulf War.
He viewed Saddam Hussein’s invasion and conquest of Kuwait as a threat not just to the region’s critical oil supplies, but also to the emerging post-Cold War world.
Bush feared that if this act of war went unanswered, it would encourage further mayhem.
Days into the crisis, Bush declared that Saddam’s aggression would not stand.
He then marshaled an unprecedented international coalition that backed sanctions and the threat of force, sent a half-million US troops halfway around the world to join hundreds of thousands from other countries, and, when diplomacy failed to bring about a complete and unconditional Iraqi withdrawal, liberated Kuwait in a matter of weeks with remarkably few US and coalition casualties.
It was a textbook case of how multilateralism could work.
Two other points are worth noting here.
First, Congress was reluctant to act on Saddam’s aggression.
The vote in the Senate authorizing military action nearly failed.
Bush, however, was prepared to order what became Operation Desert Storm even without congressional approval, given that he already had international law and the United Nations Security Council on his side.
He was that determined and that principled.
Second, Bush refused to allow himself to get caught up in events.
The mission was to liberate Kuwait, not Iraq.
Fully aware of what happened some four decades earlier when the US and UN forces expanded their strategic objective in Korea and tried to unify the peninsula by force, Bush resisted pressures to expand the war’s aims.
He worried about losing the trust of world leaders he had brought along and the loss of life that would likely result.
He also wanted to keep Arab governments on his side to improve prospects for the Middle East peace effort that was to begin in Madrid less than a year later.
Again, he was strong enough to stand up to the mood of the moment.
None of this is to say that Bush always got it right.
The end of the Gulf War was messy, as Saddam managed to hang onto power in Iraq with a brutal crackdown on Kurds in the north and Shi’a in the south.
A year later, the Bush administration was slow to respond to violence in the Balkans.
It might have done more to help Russia in its early post-Soviet days.
Overall, however, the administration’s foreign policy record compares favorably with that of any other modern US president or, for that matter, any other contemporary world leader.
One last thing. Bush assembled what was arguably the best national security team the US has ever had.
Brent Scowcroft was the gold standard in national security advisers.
James Baker was arguably the most successful secretary of state since Henry Kissinger.
And with them were Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Robert Gates, Larry Eagleburger, William Webster, and others of standing and experience.
All of which brings us back to George H.W. Bush. He chose the people.
He set the tone and the expectations. He listened.
He insisted on a formal process.
And he led.
If, as the saying goes, a fish rots from the head, it also flourishes because of the head.
The US flourished as a result of the many contributions of its 41st president. Many people around the world benefited as well.
We owe him our collective thanks.
May his well-deserved rest be peaceful.
Britain Fights Back
LONDON – As the world recovers from the Great Recession, the question facing advanced economies is this: How do we deliver sustainable growth and rising prosperity for our citizens?
In Britain, we have an economic plan that delivers economic stability, deals decisively with our record budget deficit, opens the country to trade and investment, and addresses the structural weaknesses that are holding us back as a place to do business and create jobs.
Of course, every country is different – and the policy prescriptions for each need to recognize that.
But the lesson from the British experience is that the only way to deliver prosperity – to win the so-called “global race” – is by tackling problems head-on.
When the coalition government came to office three years ago, the United Kingdom’s deficit was forecast to be higher than that of any other country in the G-20, at more than 11% of GDP.
Unlike the United States, we did not have the benefit of issuing the world’s major reserve currency.
And our proximity to the eurozone, engulfed in a sovereign-debt crisis, meant that restoring fiscal credibility and preventing a spike in market interest rates was our most urgent priority.
So, over the last three years, we have been working through a steady deficit-reduction plan. As a result, we have achieved a larger reduction in the structural deficit than any other major advanced economy.
The eurozone crisis on our doorstep, and the lingering damage inflicted by the crash of our financial system, dragged down economic growth in 2011 and 2012.
Even so, our labor market performed far better than in previous recessions, with record numbers of people remaining in work.
And our economic plan created the foundation for the strengthening of the recovery that we have seen throughout 2013, with our Funding for Lending Scheme leading to significant improvements in credit conditions.
As a result, the International Monetary Fund’s latest forecast has revised upward UK growth – and more so than for any other G-7 economy.
But that does not mean that we can relax.
The Office for Budget Responsibility, the body that provides an independent assessment of UK public finances, has shown that while the deficit has been coming down more quickly, stronger economic growth alone cannot be relied upon to address the deficit’s structural component.
Dealing with the deficit has required difficult decisions – from reforming the welfare system and increasing the state pension age to controlling public-sector pay.
But I have always believed that a country cannot make itself richer by writing checks to itself.
We need to make responsible choices to ensure that we can live within our means – and that is what I am determined to deliver.
A government that lives within its means is a necessary condition to secure the economy for the long term – but it is not sufficient.
Success also requires taking bold steps to tear down trade barriers and open the economy to investment from fast-growing countries like China and India.
That is precisely what we have done.
I would go so far as to say that no country in the West is more open to investment than the UK.
How many Western countries would allow, let alone encourage, Chinese investment in their new nuclear power stations?
Indeed, how many Western countries have an ambitious civil nuclear program at all?
We do, which is why I was in China in October agreeing a deal between Chinese investors and EDF Energy to build the first reactor in the UK for a generation.
Indeed, in international forums, the UK is the first to argue for free trade.
The deal reached at the World Trade Organization’s ministerial conference in Bali this month was a historic step forward – with an estimated benefit to the UK of $1 billion.
But the UK will continue to argue that it must be the beginning, not the end, of a wider determination to liberalize trade, in order to benefit from the growth and jobs that doing so brings.
We have also had to address the structural weaknesses that have been holding the UK back.
Perhaps the most visible sign of this has been our decision to cut the corporate tax rate to the lowest level in the G-20.
My reason is simple: I want competitive taxes that say Britain is open for business to global companies.
At a time when other countries are considering financial transaction taxes, we are abolishing some of these taxes.
And, with our banking reforms, we are strengthening our reputation as the home of global finance – from insurance to asset management, and from the new offshore renminbi markets to issuance of the first sovereign sukuk, or Islamic bond, in a non-Islamic country.
This is not about a race to the bottom; so, at the same time, Britain has been leading the way in fighting tax avoidance and evasion.
Yes, I want competitive taxes, but they must be paid.
Tax avoidance and evasion was a central theme of the UK’s presidency of the G-8 this year, resulting in commitments to unprecedented new levels of automatic exchange of tax information between countries.
Some 39 jurisdictions – from France and Germany to South Africa and Mexico – have already signed up to become early adopters of the new standard on automatic exchange.
In a global race, one cannot stand still.
So, while our education reforms are driving up standards, we need to do more.
Britain’s universities are one of our biggest assets, attracting many thousands of international students from around the world every year.
That is why, in my financial statement in the first week of December, I announced that we would lift the cap on the number of university students in the UK.
Access to higher education is a basic prerequisite for economic success, and we need to ensure that Britain can compete with the likes of the US and South Korea, which send a much higher proportion of their young people to university.
Here is the uncomfortable truth.
In a global race, there are winners and losers.
Some countries will do what it takes to remain competitive. Some will not.
I am determined that Britain will not be left behind.
More than almost any other major economy, Britain paid a heavy price in the Great Recession, which followed a decade of misguided economic policy.
Now we are fighting back, and the message to the world is clear: the UK is open for business.
Empowering Europe’s Roma
BUDAPEST – Across Europe, millions are suffering from unemployment and the prospect of a long period of economic stagnation.
But no group has been harder hit than the Roma.
There are more than ten million Roma living in Europe, mostly concentrated in the Balkans and in the European Union’s newest member states, especially Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Hungary.
What is truly shocking is that their living conditions have actually deteriorated since many of them became EU citizens.
At the same time, the majority population’s attitude has become more hostile almost everywhere in Europe.
The two trends are mutually reinforcing: marginalization breeds contempt, and vice versa.
The only escape from this trap is investment in education, which would pay enormous social dividends.
Consider, for example, that Roma represent more than 20% of new entrants into the labor force in the above-mentioned countries.
The good news is that we know how to prepare Roma children to be productive members of society.
My foundations have been active in educating Roma for more than 25 years.
Over that period, we have educated a small cohort of young Roma who retain their identity and yet can break the hostile stereotypes held by those with whom they interact.
Together with the World Bank, we established the Roma Education Fund in 2005.
The REF is ready to help national education authorities across the EU improve their performance in educating Roma children.
Indeed, its programs currently reach more than 100,000 students each year, including more than 1,600 university students who receive scholarships.
But these numbers are woefully inadequate relative to the magnitude of the problem.
Half of the Roma are of school age, and the population is growing faster than the capacity of the REF.
The Fund’s annual budget is only €12 million ($16.3 million), of which my foundations cover nearly half, and we find it difficult to secure additional funds.
That is unacceptable.
The programs developed by the REF ought to be scaled up by governments, with the help of the EU, and made available to all Roma children in Europe.
The European Commission has played a very helpful role through its structural funds, which cover up to 80% of the additional costs involved in integrating the Roma.
Unfortunately, the remaining 20% is difficult to mobilize, owing to widespread anti-Roma sentiment throughout Europe.
To break the negative stereotypes, Roma children must be educated to celebrate and take pride in their Roma heritage.
That is what the REF has done.
As it is, educated Roma do not fit the stereotypes, so they can easily blend into the majority population, but the majority’s hostility remains.
If the approach developed by the REF were generally adopted, it would go a long way toward breaking the stereotypes.
But education is not enough.
The Roma must also be able to find employment.
A lasting solution requires Europe to build a Roma working class.
Here the private sector also has a role to play.
Experts from the European Commission and from my foundations are developing a demonstration project to make private-sector internships available to Roma youth enrolled in vocational schools.
Romania already has a similar program for the majority population, and Minister of Education Remus Pricopie has pledged to open it up to the Roma.
I urge other governments to take similar steps.
Let’s be honest: There is a Roma problem in Europe, and it is getting worse.
But both the problem and its worsening reflect a toxic combination of deep-seated hostility and persistent neglect.
In fact, Europe’s educated Roma are proving every day that the problem is eminently solvable.
But solving it will take more than a generation, and Europe cannot afford to wait for economic recovery.
On the contrary, given the increase in its Roma population, Europe’s long-term prosperity depends on reversing current trends – and getting started right away.
Sustaining Ukraine’s Breakthrough
NEW YORK – Following a crescendo of terrifying violence, the Ukrainian uprising has had a surprisingly positive outcome.
Contrary to all rational expectations, a group of citizens armed with not much more than sticks and shields made of cardboard boxes and metal garbage-can lids overwhelmed a police force firing live ammunition.
There were many casualties, but the citizens prevailed.
This was one of those historic moments that leave a lasting imprint on a society’s collective memory.
How could such a thing happen?
Quantum mechanics offers a fitting metaphor.
Physicists know that subatomic phenomena can manifest themselves as both particles and waves; similarly, human beings may behave both as individual particles and as components of a larger wave.
In other words, the unpredictability of historical events like those in Ukraine has to do with an element of uncertainty in human identity.
People’s identity is made up of individual elements and elements of larger units to which they belong, and peoples’ impact on reality depends on which elements dominate their behavior.
When civilians launched a suicidal attack on an armed force in Kyiv on February 20, their sense of representing “the nation” far outweighed their concern with their individual mortality.
The result was to swing a deeply divided society from the verge of civil war to an unprecedented sense of unity.
Whether that unity endures will depend on how Europe responds.
Ukrainians have demonstrated their allegiance to a European Union that is itself hopelessly divided, with the euro crisis pitting creditor and debtor countries against one another.
That is why the EU was hopelessly outmaneuvered by Russia in the negotiations with Ukraine over an Association Agreement.
True to form, the EU under German leadership offered far too little and demanded far too much from Ukraine.
Now, after the Ukrainian people’s commitment to closer ties with Europe fueled a successful popular insurrection, the EU, along with the International Monetary Fund, is putting together a multibillion-dollar rescue package to save the country from financial collapse.
But that will not be sufficient to sustain the national unity that Ukraine will need in the coming years.
I established the Renaissance Foundation in Ukraine in 1990 – before the country achieved independence.
The foundation did not participate in the recent uprising, but it did serve as a defender of those targeted by official repression.
The foundation is now ready to support Ukrainians’ strongly felt desire to establish resilient democratic institutions (above all, an independent and professional judiciary).
But Ukraine will need outside assistance that only the EU can provide: management expertise and access to markets.
In the remarkable transformation of Central Europe’s economies in the 1990’s, management expertise and market access resulted from massive investments by German and other EU-based companies, which integrated local producers into their global value chains.
Ukraine, with its high-quality human capital and diversified economy, is a potentially attractive investment destination.
But realizing this potential requires improving the business climate across the economy as a whole and within individual sectors – particularly by addressing the endemic corruption and weak rule of law that are deterring foreign and domestic investors alike.
In addition to encouraging foreign direct investment, the EU could provide support to train local companies’ managers and help them develop their business strategies, with service providers remunerated by equity stakes or profit-sharing.
An effective way to roll out such support to a large number of companies would be to combine it with credit lines provided by commercial banks.
To encourage participation, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) could invest in companies alongside foreign and local investors, as it did in Central Europe.
Ukraine would thus open its domestic market to goods manufactured or assembled by European companies’ wholly- or partly-owned subsidiaries, while the EU would increase market access for Ukrainian companies and help them integrate into global markets.
I hope and trust that Europe under German leadership will rise to the occasion.
I have been arguing for several years that Germany should accept the responsibilities and liabilities of its dominant position in Europe.
Today, Ukraine needs a modern-day equivalent of the Marshall Plan, by which the United States helped to reconstruct Europe after World War II.
Germany ought to play the same role today as the US did then.
I must, however, end with a word of caution.
The Marshall Plan did not include the Soviet bloc, thereby reinforcing the Cold War division of Europe.
A replay of the Cold War would cause immense damage to both Russia and Europe, and most of all to Ukraine, which is situated between them.
Ukraine depends on Russian gas, and it needs access to European markets for its products; it must have good relations with both sides.
Here, too, Germany should take the lead.
Chancellor Angela Merkel must reach out to President Vladimir Putin to ensure that Russia is a partner, not an opponent, in the Ukrainian renaissance.
The World Economy’s Shifting Challenges
NEW YORK – As 2013 comes to a close, efforts to revive growth in the world’s most influential economies – with the exception of the eurozone – are having a beneficial effect worldwide.
All of the looming problems for the global economy are political in character.
After 25 years of stagnation, Japan is attempting to reinvigorate its economy by engaging in quantitative easing on an unprecedented scale.
It is a risky experiment: faster growth could drive up interest rates, making debt-servicing costs unsustainable.
But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would rather take that risk than condemn Japan to a slow death.
And, judging from the public’s enthusiastic support, so would ordinary Japanese.
By contrast, the European Union is heading toward the type of long-lasting stagnation from which Japan is desperate to escape.
The stakes are high: Nation-states can survive a lost decade or more; but the EU, an incomplete association of nation-states, could easily be destroyed by it.
The euro’s design – which was modeled on the Deutsche Mark – has a fatal flaw.
Creating a common central bank without a common treasury means that government debts are denominated in a currency that no single member country controls, making them subject to the risk of default.
As a consequence of the crash of 2008, several member countries became over indebted, and risk premia made the eurozone’s division into creditor and debtor countries permanent.
This defect could have been corrected by replacing individual countries’ bonds with Eurobonds.
Unfortunately, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, reflecting the radical change that Germans’ attitudes toward European integration have undergone, ruled that out.
Prior to reunification, Germany was the main motor of integration; now, weighed down by reunification’s costs, German taxpayers are determined to avoid becoming European debtors’ deep pocket.
After the crash of 2008, Merkel insisted that each country should look after its own financial institutions and government debts should be paid in full.
Without realizing it, Germany is repeating the tragic error of the French after World War I. Prime Minister Aristide Briand’s insistence on reparations led to the rise of Hitler; Angela Merkel’s policies are giving rise to extremist movements in the rest of Europe.
The current arrangements governing the euro are here to stay, because Germany will always do the bare minimum to preserve the common currency – and because the markets and the European authorities would punish any other country that challenged these arrangements.
Nonetheless, the acute phase of the financial crisis is now over.
The European financial authorities have tacitly recognized that austerity is counterproductive and have stopped imposing additional fiscal constraints.
This has given the debtor countries some breathing room, and, even in the absence of any growth prospects, financial markets have stabilized.
Future crises will be political in origin.
Indeed, this is already apparent, because the EU has become so inward-looking that it cannot adequately respond to external threats, be they in Syria or Ukraine.
But the outlook is far from hopeless; the revival of a threat from Russia may reverse the prevailing trend toward European disintegration.
As a result, the crisis has transformed the EU from the “fantastic object” that inspired enthusiasm into something radically different.
What was meant to be a voluntary association of equal states that sacrificed part of their sovereignty for the common good – the embodiment of the principles of an open society – has now been transformed by the euro crisis into a relationship between creditor and debtor countries that is neither voluntary nor equal.
Indeed, the euro could destroy the EU altogether.
In contrast to Europe, the United States is emerging as the developed world’s strongest economy.
Shale energy has given the US an important competitive advantage in manufacturing in general and in petrochemicals in particular.
The banking and household sectors have made some progress in deleveraging.
Quantitative easing has boosted asset values.
And the housing market has improved, with construction lowering unemployment.
The fiscal drag exerted by sequestration is also about to expire.
More surprising, the polarization of American politics shows signs of reversing.
The two-party system worked reasonably well for two centuries, because both parties had to compete for the middle ground in general elections.
Then the Republican Party was captured by a coalition of religious and market fundamentalists, later reinforced by neo-conservatives, that moved it to a far-right extreme.
The Democrats tried to catch up in order to capture the middle ground, and both parties colluded in gerrymandering Congressional districts.
As a consequence, activist-dominated party primaries took precedence over general elections.
That completed the polarization of American politics.
Eventually, the Republican Party’s Tea Party wing overplayed its hand.
After the recent debacle of the government shutdown, what remains of the Republican establishment has begun fighting back, and this should lead to a revival of the two-party system.
The major uncertainty facing the world today is not the euro but the future direction of China.
The growth model responsible for its rapid rise has run out of steam.
That model depended on financial repression of the household sector, in order to drive the growth of exports and investments.
As a result, the household sector has now shrunk to 35% of GDP, and its forced savings are no longer sufficient to finance the current growth model.
This has led to an exponential rise in the use of various forms of debt financing.
There are some eerie resemblances with the financial conditions that prevailed in the US in the years preceding the crash of 2008.
But there is a significant difference, too.
In the US, financial markets tend to dominate politics; in China, the state owns the banks and the bulk of the economy, and the Communist Party controls the state-owned enterprises.
Aware of the dangers, the People’s Bank of China took steps starting in 2012 to curb the growth of debt; but when the slowdown started to cause real distress in the economy, the Party asserted its supremacy.
In July 2013, the leadership ordered the steel industry to restart the furnaces and the PBOC to ease credit.
The economy turned around on a dime.
In November, the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee announced far-reaching reforms.
These developments are largely responsible for the recent improvement in the global outlook.
The Chinese leadership was right to give precedence to economic growth over structural reforms, because structural reforms, when combined with fiscal austerity, push economies into a deflationary tailspin.
But there is an unresolved self-contradiction in China’s current policies: restarting the furnaces also reignites exponential debt growth, which cannot be sustained for much longer than a couple of years.
How and when this contradiction will be resolved will have profound consequences for China and the world.
A successful transition in China will most likely entail political as well as economic reforms, while failure would undermine still-widespread trust in the country’s political leadership, resulting in repression at home and military confrontation abroad.
The other great unresolved problem is the absence of proper global governance.
The lack of agreement among the United Nations Security Council’s five permanent members is exacerbating humanitarian catastrophes in countries like Syria – not to mention allowing global warming to proceed largely unhindered.
But, in contrast to the Chinese conundrum, which will come to a head in the next few years, the absence of global governance may continue indefinitely.
Angela Merkel’s Pyrrhic Victory
BUDAPEST – As far as Germany is concerned, the drama of the euro crisis is over.
The subject was barely discussed in the country’s recent election campaign.
Chancellor Angela Merkel did what was necessary to ensure the euro’s survival, and she did so at the least possible cost to Germany – a feat that earned her the support of pro-European Germans as well as those who trust her to protect German interests.
Not surprisingly, she won re-election resoundingly.
But it was a Pyrrhic victory.
The eurozone status quo is neither tolerable nor stable.
Mainstream economists would call it an inferior equilibrium; I call it a nightmare – one that is inflicting tremendous pain and suffering that could be easily avoided if the misconceptions and taboos that sustain it were dispelled. The problem is that the debtor countries feel all the pain, while the creditors impose the misconceptions and taboos.
One example is Eurobonds, which Merkel has declared taboo.
Yet they are the obvious solution to the root cause of the euro crisis, which is that joining the euro exposed member countries’ government bonds to the risk of default.
Normally, developed countries never default, because they can always print money.
But, by ceding that authority to an independent central bank, the eurozone’s members put themselves in the position of a developing country that has borrowed in foreign currency.
Neither the authorities nor the markets recognized this prior to the crisis, attesting to the fallibility of both.
When the euro was introduced, the authorities actually declared member states’ government bonds to be riskless.
Commercial banks could hold them without setting aside any capital reserves, and the European Central Bank (ECB) accepted them on equal terms at its discount window.
This created a perverse incentive for commercial banks to buy the weaker governments’ debt in order to earn what eventually became just a few basis points, as interest-rate differentials converged to practically zero.
But interest-rate convergence caused economic divergence.
The weaker countries enjoyed real-estate, consumption, and investment booms, while Germany, weighed down by the fiscal burden of reunification, had to adopt austerity and implement structural reforms.
That was the origin of the euro crisis, but it was not recognized at the time – and is not properly understood even today.
Converting all outstanding government bonds – with the exception of Greece’s – into Eurobonds would be by far the best remedy.
It would require no transfer payments, because each country would remain responsible for servicing its own debt.
And it would impose stricter market discipline on debtor countries than they currently face, because they could issue Eurobonds only to refinance maturing ones; any additional borrowing would have to be in their own name, and markets would impose penalty rates for excessive borrowing.
Yet Eurobonds would substantially reduce the heavily indebted countries’ borrowing costs and go a long way to reestablishing a level playing field in the eurozone.
Germany’s credit rating would not be endangered, because Eurobonds would compare favorably with bonds issued by other major countries.
Eurobonds would not cure disparities in competitiveness; eurozone countries would still need to undertake their own structural reforms.
But they would remedy the euro’s main design flaw.
All the alternatives are inferior: they either involve transfer payments, perpetuate an uneven playing field, or both.
And yet, owing to Merkel’s opposition, Eurobonds cannot even be considered.
Greece, too, is a victim of its creditors’ misconceptions and taboos.
Everyone knows that it can never pay back its debt, most of which is held by the official sector: the ECB, eurozone member states, or the International Monetary Fund.
After undergoing a lot of pain and suffering, Greece is close to posting a primary budget surplus.
If the official sector could forgo repayment as long as Greece meets the conditions imposed by the Troika (the ECB, the European Commission, and the IMF), private capital would return and the economy could recover rapidly.
I can testify from personal experience that investors would flock to Greece once the debt overhang was removed.
But the official sector cannot write down its debt, because that would violate a number of taboos, particularly for the ECB.
Germany would do well to remember that it has benefited from debt write-downs three times in its history.
The Dawes Plan of 1924 sought to stagger Germany’s reparations payments for World War I. The Young Plan of 1929 reduced the sum that Germany owed in reparations and gave the country much more time to pay.
The post-World War II Marshall Plan provided debt relief as well.
French insistence on harsh reparations payments after World War I clearly prepared the ground for the rise of Hitler.
The rise of Greece’s neo-fascist Golden Dawn is a similar phenomenon.
These two examples justify my description of the euro crisis as a nightmare.
Only Germany can end it, because, as the country with the highest credit rating and largest and strongest economy by far, it is in charge.
Germany, mindful of its recent history, does not want to be cast in the role of a hegemonic power; the current situation is not the result of some evil German plot.
Still, Germany cannot escape the responsibilities and liabilities that go with that role.
It must learn to act as a benign hegemon.
Doing so would earn Germany the lasting gratitude of the countries that are currently subordinated to it, just as the Marshall Plan earned the United States the lasting gratitude of Europe.
Failure to seize this moment would, I believe, lead to the disintegration and eventual collapse of the European Union.
Of course, many countries have lived through nightmares and survived.
But the EU is not a country; it is an incomplete association of sovereign states that will not survive a decade or more of stagnation.
That is not in Germany’s interest, and it would leave Europeans worse off than they were when they embarked on the EU project.
Making a U-turn is never easy for political leaders, but elections do provide an opportunity for a policy change.
The best way to make one would be for Merkel’s next government to appoint an independent expert commission to evaluate the alternatives, without regard to the prevailing taboos.
Europe’s Ukrainian Lifeline
NEW YORK – Last weekend’s European Parliament election and presidential election in Ukraine produced sharply contrasting results.
Europe’s voters expressed their dissatisfaction with the way that the European Union currently functions, while Ukraine’s people demonstrated their desire for association with the EU.
European leaders and citizens should take this opportunity to consider what that means – and how helping Ukraine can also help Europe.
The EU was originally conceived to be an ever-closer association of sovereign states willing to pool a gradually increasing share of their sovereignty for the common good.
It was a bold experiment in international governance and the rule of law, aimed at replacing nationalism and the use of force.
Unfortunately the euro crisis transformed the EU into something radically different: a relationship of creditors and debtors in which the creditor countries impose conditions that perpetuate their dominance.
Given low turnout for the European Parliament election, and if support for Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi were added to the anti-EU vote on the left and the right, it could be argued that the majority of citizens are opposed to current conditions.
Meanwhile, just as Europe’s bold experiment in international governance is faltering, Russia is emerging as a dangerous rival to the EU, one that has global geopolitical ambitions and is willing to use force.
Putin is exploiting an ethnic national ideology (and support from the Orthodox Church) to bolster his regime.
Indeed, speaking on the Russian radio program Direct Line last month, he extolled the genetic virtues of the Russian people.
The annexation of Crimea has made him popular at home, and his effort to weaken America’s global dominance, in part by seeking an alliance with China, has resonated favorably in the rest of the world.
But the Putin regime’s self-interest is at odds with Russia’s strategic interests; Russia would benefit more from closer cooperation with the EU and the United States.
And resorting to repression in Russia and Ukraine is directly counterproductive.
The Russian economy is weakening, despite the high price of oil, owing to the flight of capital and talent.
Using violence in Kyiv’s Maidan has led to the birth of a new Ukraine that is determined not to become part of a new Russian empire.
The success of the new Ukraine would constitute an existential threat to Putin’s rule in Russia.
That is why he has tried so hard to destabilize Ukraine by fostering self-declared separatist republics in eastern Ukraine.
With the Donbas region’s largest employer mobilizing protests against the separatists, Putin’s plan may not work, and he is now likely to accept the results of the presidential election, thereby avoiding additional sanctions.
But Russia is likely to seek other avenues to destabilize the new Ukraine, which should not be too difficult, given that the security forces, having served the corrupt regime of former President Viktor Yanukovych, are demoralized and not necessarily loyal to the new leadership.
All of this has happened very fast and very recently.
Both the EU and the US are preoccupied with their internal problems and remain largely unaware of the geopolitical and ideological threat that Putin’s Russia poses.
How should they respond?
The first task is to counteract Russia’s efforts to destabilize Ukraine.
With the EU’s “fiscal compact” and other rules limiting the scope of government assistance, innovative thinking is needed.
The single most effective measure would be to offer free political risk insurance to those who invest in or do business with Ukraine.
This would keep the economy running, despite the political turmoil, and it would signal to Ukrainians that the EU and the US – governments and private investors alike – are committed to them.
Businesses would flock to a newly open and promising market if they were fully compensated for losses caused by political events beyond their control.
Political risk insurance may sound too complex to deploy quickly.
In fact, insurance of this type already exists.
Private insurers and reinsurers like Germany’s Euler Hermes have offered it for years.
So have government institutions, like the World Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the US government’s Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
They must, however, charge substantial premiums to cover the cost of reinsurance.
Faced with high premiums, most businesses would simply opt to wait on the sidelines until the storm passed.
That is why the governments concerned must take over the reinsurance function and use their agencies only to administer the insurance policies.
They could guarantee the losses in the same way as they underwrite the World Bank: each government would provide a modest pro-rata capital infusion and commit the rest in the form of callable capital that would be available if and when losses are actually paid out.
The EU would have to modify the fiscal compact to exempt the callable capital and allow actual losses to be amortized over a number of years.
Guarantees of this kind have a peculiar feature: the more convincing they are, the less likely they are to be invoked; the reinsurance is likely to turn out to be largely costless.
The World Bank is a living example.
By acting promptly and convincingly, the EU could save Ukraine – and itself.
What I propose for Ukraine could also be implemented at home.
As long as there are so many productive resources lying idle, it would make sense to exempt from the fiscal compact investments that would eventually pay for themselves.
Renzi, for one, is advocating precisely this course of action.
Putin plans to turn Crimea into a showcase by lavishing more than €50 billion on it in the next few years.
With European support, Ukraine could compare favorably.
And, if such an initiative marks the beginning of a growth policy that Europe so badly needs, by saving Ukraine Europe would also be saving itself.
George W. Bush and America's Neglected Hemisphere
When the NATO Allies gather in Istanbul, much of the talk will concern the divisions between America and Europe over Iraq.
But Europe is not alone in its estrangement from the United States under President George W. Bush's leadership.
Among the vast list of unforeseen consequences springing from the US fiasco in Iraq is the vital fact that, across Latin America, anti-Americanism is on the rise and is rapidly generating myriad grim effects on the region's politics.
The parallel with Europe does not end there.
Before the Bush administration, various American presidents worked hard to change the US relationship with Latin America from one of hegemon and dominated states to something like the relations that exist with the European allies.
All of that is now gravely at risk - a dangerous turn of events.
Complete estrangement from the US in Latin America will not only harm hemispheric relations, but may discredit broader ideas that are closely associated with the US.
Many of these pernicious side effects can already be perceived.
The first, and deepest, consequence consists in plummeting prestige of and respect for the US and the Bush administration in Latin American public opinion.
This was not the case at the beginning of Bush's term as president.
On the contrary, many capitals south of the Rio Grande had high expectations for the team that moved into the White House in 2001.
After all, during his first nine months in office, Bush declared that he would devote tremendous attention to the hemisphere, and his actions seemed to back up his rhetoric.
He visited Mexico before any other country, renewed Temporary Protection Status for Central American immigrants, maintained President Bill Clinton's waiver of certain trade restrictions on countries and companies doing business with Cuba, and gave new impetus to the negotiations to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas.
Iraq changed all of this.
The invasion, the absence of any weapons of mass destruction or any link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, the pictures of Iraqi civilian casualties, and the subsequent scenes of humiliating mistreatment or torture of Iraqi prisoners and detainees have all contributed to a wide, deep, and probably lasting collapse of sympathy for the US in the region.
This can be measured in public opinion polls, in newspaper editorials, congressional resolutions, summit declarations, and street demonstrations.
A second effect follows directly from the first.
At least rhetorically speaking, government parties or leaders with a strong anti-US tilt are gaining ground, from Mexico City's Mayor Andrés Manuel López Obrador to the Frente Amplio party in Uruguay, from Schaddick Handal in the old FMLN in El Salvador to Evo Morales in Bolivia, not to mention governments like Hugo Chávez's in Venezuela and Nestor Kirchner's in Argentina.
These anti-US forces are not all necessarily left wing; they are, however, stridently critical of the US. In all likelihood, they will become more vociferous and vituperative before they mellow, because public opinion seems to be rewarding stances and tones such as theirs.
America's friends in Latin America are feeling the fire of this anti-American wrath.
They are finding themselves forced to shift their own rhetoric and attitude in order to dampen their defense of policies viewed as pro-American or US-inspired, and to stiffen their resistance to Washington's demands and desires.
In many cases, American demands and desires are contrary to Latin interests, and should be resisted.
But in other cases, opposition to America's preferences is wrought by public sentiment and goes against the instincts of leaders who know better.
The Bush's administration has brought all of this upon itself.
It could have either avoided a monumental mistake, as Iraq has now proved to be, or it could have brought the United Nations on board from the outset, ensuring that military action, and the subsequent occupation and reconstruction of the country, would have broad multilateral support.
At worst, the Bush administration could have acted alone, but with sufficient force, skill, and diligence - and with the appropriate and imperative respect for human rights and international law - to get the job done quickly.
Instead, the Bush administration, for reasons that are increasingly perplexing, went at it alone.
Moreover, it did so without an endgame strategy, and with a level of force so "underwhelming" that it made the outrageous behavior at the Abu Ghraib prison almost inevitable.
By so doing, Bush's team left America's friends in Latin America - no less than in Europe and elsewhere - in a hapless situation: rightly unable and unwilling to support the US march of folly, and understandably reluctant to poison hemispheric relations in general with the type of strident criticism that local public opinion demands.
Europe’s Middle East Mission
LONDON – America’s gradual withdrawal from the Middle East puts increasing pressure on Europe to help foster peace in the region.
With complex and heated wars threatening to bring about the collapse of states like Syria and Iraq, and the long-simmering conflict between Israel and Palestine seemingly as far from resolution as ever, it is almost easier to ask what Europe should avoid than what it should do.
The starting point must be a simple, fundamental principle: Europe should not take sides.
Allowing preconceptions or emotional reactions to overshadow facts could make the situation much more dangerous.
Consider sectarian struggle between Sunni and Shia Muslims – now the prime mover of events in the Middle East.
Fueled by religious rhetoric and a bloody history, the conflict engenders a degree of passion and irrationality that is difficult to moderate.
As has been said: “Where the fires of faith are burning, the goddess of reason tiptoes silently out of the room.”
Likewise, when it comes to the Israel-Palestine conflict, Europe must recognize that both sides are hypersensitive.
If they are faced with criticism that they deem unfair, they will resort to the kind of truculence and bitterness that has long thwarted efforts to reach an agreement.
At least two-thirds of Israelis, recognizing the benefits that lasting peace would bring to the region, would prefer a two-state solution.
But the same majority fears that the Palestinians – with the split leadership of a relatively moderate Fatah under Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and a Gaza administration under the implacable, terror-supporting leadership of Hamas – are not ready for a conventional peace and good neighborly relations.
Making matters worse, concessions on either side appear to leave no impression on the other.
On the contrary, they are usually met with lethal provocations that push any agreement even further away.
Palestine’s response to Israel’s release in December of 26 political prisoners – the third batch from a total of 104 detainees that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu pledged to release when the peace talks were revived last summer – is a case in point.
Many of the prisoners had committed heinous acts of terror.
For example, Juma Ibrahim Juma Adam and Mahmoud Salam Saliman Abu Karbish firebombed a civilian bus, killing a pregnant woman, three of her preschool-age children, and the Israeli soldier who tried to save them.
Yet Abbas received them upon their release, praising them as heroes of the Palestinian people and examples for Palestinian youth.
In this fragile context, EU threats to halt business with Israeli companies present in the country’s West Bank settlements are problematic, as are academic and scientific boycotts against Israel.
Indeed, such moves would be dangerously close to favoring Palestine – a sure-fire way to turn Israel against cooperation.
Of course, given the role that the continual expansion of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestine has played in hampering progress toward peace, it merits a more thorough and sober examination by all relevant parties – especially Israel.
This requires, first and foremost, an understanding of the issue’s scale.
During previous rounds of negotiations, the Palestinian Authority agreed, in principle, to exchange up to 1.9% of West Bank land for Israeli territory.
This means that Israel would be able to annex some settlements adjacent to its border, while giving up only a small share of its land – an exchange to which it should be open when serious negotiations are underway.
The good news is that Tzipi Livni, Israel’s main negotiator, recently stated that Israel would not claim isolated settlements on Arab land.
Through all of this, Europe must present itself as an unbiased mediator.
If negotiators on both sides view it as a credible broker of a lasting and balanced agreement, they may be more receptive to each other’s concessions.
The same is true of religious conflicts throughout the Middle East.
Instead of getting sucked into historical enmities and impassioned disputes, Europe must be resolved to fight implacably against all forms of jihadism, while consistently supporting progress toward conflict resolution.
This does not apply only to diplomats; the European media also have a critical role to play.
New and traditional outlets alike must ensure that they portray the facts accurately and dispassionately, in order to foster a constructive, fair-minded discussion.
Those directly involved in the Middle East’s myriad conflicts do not need any help generating heat.
Georgia on Europe’s Mind
The era in which Europe could rely on America to wage war, make peace, and establish democracy in its own backyard is over.
With European Union enlargement, and as the recent Russian gas crisis demonstrated, that backyard now includes not just Ukraine, but Georgia as well.
Indeed, as in Ukraine, Georgia is undergoing a test of democracy that Europe cannot afford to ignore.
Georgia was the first post-Soviet country to stage a “color revolution,” and thus to demonstrate, with dignity and maturity, its people’s choice for democracy and European values.
The European Union flags that have flown on all Georgian public buildings since then signal a natural attachment, as old as the history of a country that, for the ancient Greeks, was an integral part of the world as it was then known.
Prometheus, Medea, the Amazons and, in neighboring Armenia, Noah’s Ark – the Europe of our myths starts here.
With its history, culture, and traditions – including its critical, independent, and even rebellious spirit within the former Soviet Union – Georgia would seem to be an ideal candidate for successful democratization.
So it is all the more worrisome that democratization there is foundering.
Everything seemed to have started well enough.
Political reforms, privatization, anti-corruption measures, a search for new leaders untainted by compromise with the former regime, and implementation of a pro-European foreign policy met no resistance.
But the totalitarian mindset has since resurfaced in leaders who, with their claim to represent the will of the majority, appropriate more and more power.
Like the ancient Greeks’ Hydra, Georgia’s political elite never ceases to die and be reborn.
The same people and governing methods that the “Rose Revolution” of November 2003 sought to defeat have reemerged at the center of power by using their personal networks, which extend outside Georgia’s borders, as well as their tremendous wealth and finely honed skills at political scheming and manipulation.
This bears little in common with the essence of democracy, which consists not merely in ballot boxes, but in the separation of powers.
The government meddles in the affairs of the parliament, which in turn seeks to micro-manage the government – including, in my case, the nomination of ambassadors and their daily routines!
Finally, and more seriously, the judiciary is not yet independent, undermining the rule of law and thus deterring badly needed private investment.
Georgia’s democracy exists in its head, but not yet in its body: citizens still spurn politics as a dirty pursuit, abandoning the ground to those who should have been retired long ago.
But the hope of democracy remains strongly rooted in Georgia’s people, civic organizations, and media.
Now is the time for Europe to ensure that this hope is not extinguished.
The US has already done as much as it can to support political stability in Georgia since independence.
To be sure, stability was not always identified with democracy during the rule of Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Union foreign minister who was ousted as our president by the Rose Revolution.
But Americans invested generously in the survival of democratic ideas and leaders.
Although the foundation backed by the financier George Soros did not fabricate the Rose Revolution, as Russian nationalists claim, it certainly nurtured, encouraged, and supported democracy’s preconditions.
But, to help consolidate its democracy, Georgia now requires support of a different nature, which Europe is better equipped to offer.
The models for the balance of powers, the functioning of the judiciary, and local democracy must be inspired by European forms, which are closer to Georgian reality than Anglo-Saxon models of the American type.
Europe’s rejection of this challenge would betray its fundamental duties in a place – small, Mediterranean, flexible, with old historical traditions – where democracy stands a much greater chance of success than in Ukraine, which is both huge and still very Soviet-minded, not to mention Central Asia.
Indeed, refusal to support Georgia’s struggling democracy would most likely postpone democratic progress in Ukraine, Belarus, even in Russia itself.
This clearly raises the stakes.
Russia, while never renouncing its imperial dreams and instruments of domination, was nonetheless coming to terms with the inevitability of democracy, at least on its margins.
But this hesitant acceptance of a certain normality in its relations with its neighbors has always been vulnerable to a sudden eruption of Russia’s famously irrational “derzhava” – an aggressive ethos that glorifies the state and asserts its strength by pouncing on weakness.
This is the key to understanding the recent Russian gas crisis.
Just as surely, any sign of a retreat from democracy in Georgia and other post-Soviet states will merely fuel Russia’s neo-imperial ambitions.
It is Europe’s responsibility to convince Russia that there is no hope of a return to the past.
Europe must assume this role not only to ensure the future independence of its energy supply, but also to demonstrate that European values of freedom, democracy, and justice between peoples have real force.
To succeed, Europe must equip itself with the necessary instruments: a large semi-public foundation to promote Europe and support political reform, a university to train future executives of nascent democracies, a police force, and an army of judges and magistrates to breathe life into the models that we want to emulate.
Above all, Europe needs conviction.
If Europe today cannot convince itself that it has a vital interest in its neighbors’ future, who will believe in Europe tomorrow?
Germany’s Hour
LONDON – Who runs the European Union?
On the eve of Germany’s general election, that is a very timely question.
One standard reply is, “The EU’s member states” – all 28 of them.
Another is, “The European Commission.”
But Paul Lever, a former British ambassador to Germany, offers a more pointed answer: Berlin Rules is the title of his new book, in which he writes, “Modern Germany has shown that politics can achieve what used to require war.”
Germany is the EU’s most populous state and its economic powerhouse, accounting for over 20% of the bloc’s GDP.
Determining why Germany has been so economically successful appears to be elusive.
But three unique features of its so-called Rhineland model stand out.
First, Germany has preserved its manufacturing capacity much better than other advanced economies have.
Manufacturing still accounts for 23% of the German economy, compared to 12% in the United States and 10% in the United Kingdom.
And manufacturing employs 19% of the German workforce, as opposed to 10% in the US and 9% in the UK.
Germany’s success in retaining its industrial base contradicts rich countries’ standard practice of outsourcing manufacturing to locations with lower labor costs.
But Germany has never accepted the static theory of comparative advantage on which this practice is based.
True to the legacy of Friedrich List, the father of German economics, who wrote in 1841, “the power of producing wealth is therefore infinitely more important than wealth itself,” Germany has retained its manufacturing edge through a relentless commitment to process innovation, backed by a network of research institutes.
Its export-led growth has given it the benefit of increasing returns to scale.
The second feature of the German model is its “social market economy,” best reflected in its unique system of industrial “co-determination.”
Alone among the major advanced economies, Germany practices “stakeholder capitalism.”
All companies are required by law to have works councils.
Indeed, large companies are run by two boards: a management board and a supervisory board, divided equally between shareholders and employee representatives, which take strategic decisions.
The resistance to offshoring is therefore much stronger than elsewhere, as is a willingness to restrain wage costs.
Finally, there is Germany’s firm commitment to price stability.
Germany needed no lessons from Milton Friedman on the evils of inflation.
They were already hard-wired into its most famous post-war institution, the Bundesbank.
Lever suggests that it was as much the memory of the currency collapse of 1945-1948 as of the hyperinflation of the 1920s that drove home this lesson.
Likewise, an aversion to public deficits mirrors the population’s resistance to private indebtedness.
Institutionally, the EU has become Germany writ large.
The Commission, the European Parliament, European Council, and the European Court of Justice mirror the decentralized structure of Germany itself.
The EU’s gospel of “subsidiarity” reflects the division of powers between Germany’s federal government and states (Länder).
Germany ensures that Germans fill the leading positions in EU bodies.
The EU rules through its institutions, but the German government rules those institutions.
Yet talk of “hegemony,” or even “leadership,” is taboo in Germany – a reticence that stems from Germans’ determination not to remind people of their country’s dark past.
But denying leadership while exercising it means that no discussion of Germany’s responsibilities is possible.
And this inflicts costs – especially economic costs – on other EU member states.
Germany has created a system of rules that entrenches its competitive advantage.
The single currency rules out devaluation within the eurozone.
It also ensures that the euro is worth less than a purely German currency would be.
The EU’s recent Treaty on Fiscal Union – the successor to the Growth and Stability Pact – prescribes binding legal commitments to balanced budgets and modest national debt, backed by supervision and sanctions.
This precludes deficit finance to boost growth.
And Germany’s insistence that non-wage costs be equivalent throughout the EU is less a device for enhancing Germany’s competitiveness than for reducing others’.
The EU, especially the 19-member eurozone, thus functions as a vast home base for Germany, from which it can launch its assault on foreign markets.
And that base is strong.
Germany exports to the EU 30% more than it imports from it, and runs one of the world’s largest current-account surpluses.
This is a benign rather than a brutal hegemony.
But at its heart lies a massive contradiction.
National accounts must balance.
A surplus in one part of Europe means a deficit in another.
The eurozone was established without a fiscal transfer mechanism to succor members of the family who get into trouble; the European Central Bank is prohibited from acting as lender of last resort to the banking system; and the Commission’s proposal for Eurobonds – collectively guaranteed national bond issues – has foundered on Germany’s objection that it would bear most of the liability.
Germany has been willing to provide emergency finance to debt-strapped eurozone members like Greece on the condition that they “put their houses in order” – cut social spending, sell off state assets, and take other steps to make themselves more competitive.
The Germans see no reason to take measures to reduce their own super-competitiveness.
What can be done to achieve a more symmetric adjustment between Europe’s creditors and debtors?
Barring a fiscal transfer mechanism, John Maynard Keynes’s 1941 plan for an International Clearing Union might be adapted for the eurozone.
Member countries’ central banks would hold their residual euro balances in accounts with a European Clearing Bank.
Pressure would be simultaneously placed on creditor and debtor countries to balance their accounts, by charging rising interest rates on persistent imbalances.
An EU clearing union would be a less visible intrusion on German national interests than a fiscal transfer union would be.
The essential point, though, is that for the eurozone to work, the strong must be prepared to show solidarity with the weak.
Without some mechanism to realize that, the EU will limp from crisis to crisis – probably shedding members along the way.
Is Germany Unbalanced or Unhinged?
HAMBURG – For US President Donald Trump, the measure of a country’s economic strength is its current-account balance – its exports of goods and services minus its imports.
This idea is of course the worst kind of economic nonsense.
It underpins the doctrine known as mercantilism, which comprises a hoary set of beliefs discredited more than two centuries ago.
Mercantilism suggests, among other things, that Germany is the world’s strongest economy, because it has the largest current-account surplus.
In 2016, Germany ran a current-account surplus of roughly €270 billion ($297 billion), or 8.6% of GDP, making it an obvious target of Trump’s ire.
And its bilateral trade surplus of $65 billion with the United States presumably makes it an even more irresistible target.
Never mind that, as a member of the eurozone, Germany has no exchange rate to manipulate.
Forget that Germany is relatively open to US exports, or that its policymakers are subject to the European Union’s anti-subsidy regulations.
Ignore the fact that bilateral balances are irrelevant for welfare when countries run surpluses with some trade partners and deficits with others.
All that matters for Trump is that he has his scapegoat.
Back in the real world, the explanation for Germany’s external surplus is not that it manipulates its currency or discriminates against imports, but that it saves more than it invests.
The correspondence of savings minus investment with exports minus imports is not an economic theory; it’s an accounting identity.
Germans collectively spend less than they produce, and the difference necessarily shows up as net exports.
Germany has a high savings rate for good reason.
Its population is aging more rapidly than most.
Its sensible people are sensibly saving for retirement.
They are accumulating assets now so they can de-accumulate them later, when old-age dependency ratios are higher.
This is why the advice German leaders receive from White House advisers and even from some German economists – that Germany would be better off abandoning the euro and letting its currency appreciate – makes little sense.
Changing the exchange rate would not diminish the incentive for Germans to save.
Moreover, allowing the exchange rate to appreciate would discourage investment in capital-intensive traded-goods sectors.
To be sure, a stronger currency might increase investment in services by raising the relative price of nontraded goods.
But the incentive to invest in services would have to be boosted massively, given that the sector is not capital intensive, to offset lower investment in export industries.
Better than fiddling with the currency would be to address saving and investment directly.
Here is where the two principal parties vying in Germany’s upcoming election differ.
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats suggest cutting taxes.
This makes sense insofar as the German government is a massive net saver; the 2016 budget surplus was €23.7 billion, a record high.
The problem is that there is no guarantee that German households, being voracious savers themselves, will spend the additional income.
Extending investment tax credits to German firms might be more effective in boosting spending, but doing so would be politically problematic in a country where labor’s share of national income is already declining.
Martin Schulz’s Social Democrats, on the other hand, favor raising public spending, by investing in infrastructure in particular.
In the current European environment of near-zero interest rates, there’s little risk that additional public investment will crowd out private investment.
And Germany has massive unmet needs in health care, education, and communication and transportation infrastructure.
Some will object that infrastructure and public services are nontraded goods, so more spending on them won’t boost imports or narrow the current-account balance.
But if the government, in a fully employed economy, redirects resources toward the production of nontraded goods, households and firms will have to find other ways of satisfying their demand for tradables.
The only sure way of doing that is by purchasing additional imports, spending on which will inevitably increase.
The question, ultimately, is why Germany should seek to reduce its current-account surplus.
One answer is to get out of Trump’s sights.
A better answer, offered by the International Monetary Fund, is that doing so would be good for a world economy in which investment is in short supply, as evidenced by record-low interest rates.
It would be good for Southern Europe, which needs to export more, but can only do so if someone else, like the largest Northern European economy, imports more.
Most of all, more investment in infrastructure, health, and education would be good for Germany itself.
Well-targeted public investment can raise productivity and boost living standards, ameliorate concerns about inequality, and address Germany’s economic weaknesses.
For example, there are exactly zero German universities in the top 50 globally.
More public funds would make a difference.
“The world’s strongest economy” can do better.
The DNA of German Foreign Policy
BERLIN – The harsh reality of the past year has created unprecedented challenges for Germany and its foreign policy.
The crisis in Ukraine spiraled out of control, with Russia's annexation of Crimea, followed by military escalation in the eastern Donbas region, calling into question the post-1945 European order.
And, though the measures agreed in Minsk earlier this month offer an opportunity to enter into a political process, other crises – for example, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and the advance of ISIS – have presented new, urgent challenges.
Whether Germany should assume greater responsibility for seeking to resolve such issues is a hotly debated question, both inside and outside the country.
During a year-long “Review 2014," experts, officials, and the wider public discussed challenges, priorities, and instruments of German foreign policy, and tried to define Germany's role in the world.
At the end of the day, outcomes are always concrete.
In some areas, we have been successful over the last year; in others, we can and want to do better.
Germany is widely appreciated for its commitment to promoting peaceful conflict resolution, the rule of law, and a sustainable economic model.
Yet it is abundantly clear from the Review that our partners expect a more active – and even more robust – German foreign policy in the future.
Expectations are high – perhaps too high at times.
So it is up to Germany's people to answer the difficult questions: Where do our interests lie?
How far do our responsibilities extend?
What, in short, is the “DNA" of German foreign policy?
The basic tenets of Germany's foreign policy – close partnership with France within a united Europe and a strong transatlantic alliance in terms of both security and economic cooperation – have withstood the test of time, and will remain a cornerstone of our approach.
But now we must address three key challenges: crisis management, the changing global order, and our position within Europe.
For starters, we must face the fact that globalization has made crises the rule, not the exception.
Though globalization and digitization are driving rapid economic growth, they are also putting pressure on governments worldwide to meet citizens' rising expectations – even as they constrain in unprecedented ways governments' ability to act.
In our globalized world, many people feel a growing desire for the clear answers and timeless validity offered by straightforward and clear-cut identities.
When these identities take the form of nationalism or rigidly defined religious or ethnic categories, the consequence, all too often, is brutal and unrestrained violence, whether through terrorism or civil war.
In confronting crises, German foreign policy must strengthen its focus on reconciliation, mediation, and prevention – or risk being left with no other option but damage control.
Germany is willing to do more in this area internationally.
We want to act sooner, more decisively, and in a more substantial manner – not just when crises become acute, but also by focusing on conflict prevention and post-conflict management.
This requires that we hone our tools and develop new ones, ranging from early-warning mechanisms to enhanced means of international cooperation.
We will review how we can help the United Nations more significantly in safeguarding and building peace.
We must address, with restraint and prudence – rather than with a reflexive “nein" – the difficult question of whether military means are necessary to safeguard political solutions.
We do not know when and where the next crisis will erupt, but we do know that it will – and that we must be better prepared when it does.
But foreign policy must not focus exclusively on crises.
It must also prepare for future scenarios.
And, because Germany is connected to the rest of the world like few other countries, a commitment to a just, peaceful, and resilient international order is a fundamental interest of our foreign policy.
That means adjusting to the long-term changes in the existing order's parameters – changes that have been wrought, above all, by China's rapid rise.
As the tectonic plates of world politics shift, Germany must be more precise in defining its own contributions to maintaining existing structures of international order and establishing new ones.
We must think more deeply about ways to safeguard valuable public goods: the seas, space, and the Internet.
As a result, we must strike the right balance between reinforcing indispensable structures and organizations like the UN and developing new norms and institutional means of minimizing long-term risks.
The key challenge is to develop a proactive foreign policy that invests in order, international institutions, and the intelligent strengthening of international law.
Then there is Europe, which remains the foundation of Germany's foreign policy.
But here, too, new challenges require new answers.
Above all, we must prevent a strategic dilemma in which Germany felt forced to decide between its competitiveness in a globalized world and European integration.
Europe should benefit from Germany's strength, just as we benefit from Europe's.
As Europe's largest economy, we must invest in integration.
That is the source of our strength.
At the same time, we must withstand the temptations that come with Germany's current stature.
In very different ways, the US, Russia, and China are offering Germany a privileged relationship.
But, though we want to maintain and strengthen bilateral ties with important partner countries, when it comes to shaping global development, Germany is capable of acting effectively only within a solid European framework.
We have no reason to shrink from these challenges.
Even under the pressures of a globalized world, democratic systems that champion the rule of law are more resilient than the illiberal regimes that many – including some in Europe – are praising nowadays.
But this does not mean that we can defuse any crisis by means of preventive action or clever intervention.
Now more than ever, understanding the limits of one's capabilities is an essential part of a viable foreign policy.
This does not mean embracing moral relativism.
Our foreign policy must retain its hopefulness and ability to act responsibly.
Yet holding firm to our moral precepts must go hand in hand with a realistic assessment of constraints.
Germany's global inter-connectedness, which has long been vital for our prosperity and security, does not allow us to pretend that we are either an island or a world historical force.
Within any effective peace strategy for the twenty-first century, foreign policy must simultaneously focus on crisis prevention and diplomacy, and bolster efforts that support transformation.
For Germany, all of these objectives must be pursued within the framework of a strong and integrated European Union in which we assume our leadership responsibilities for global peace and prosperity.
Germany has much to offer to the world, and we will do so with self-confidence and humility.
The Limits of German Guilt
MUNICH – This month marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Germany and Israel.
The bilateral relationship, born in the wake of the Nazis’ annihilation of European Jewry, has developed into a solid one.
But fading memories of the Holocaust among younger Germans, together with Israel’s declining international standing, have lately challenged the official discourse about “special” ties between the two countries.
David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s founding father and the architect of Israel’s reconciliation with Germany, was a pragmatist through and through.
He knew that forging a partnership with Germany, which included reparations that would help boost Israel’s capabilities, could go a long way toward securing Israel’s survival.
Of course, the reparations – which began in 1952 – served Germany’s interests, too.
The best way to regain international legitimacy after World War II was to atone publicly for the atrocities committed by the Nazis, and reconcile with the world’s Jewish population.
But the case for establishing full diplomatic relations was not so clear.
Fearing that such a move would undermine its relationships with Arab countries, and thus its objective of maintaining an impartial Middle East policy, Chancellor Ludwig Erhard’s government resisted Israeli pressure to establish full ties until 1965.
Even then, German policy in the Middle East continued to reflect a domestic consensus that Germany’s responsibility for Israel’s security must be balanced with an effort to remain neutral in the region’s affairs.
Still, over the last half-century, the bilateral relationship has become a formidable one.
Germany is Israel’s largest trading partner in Europe, and its third-largest overall, after the United States and China.
Moreover, Germany has been among Israel’s most reliable allies, exemplified by its role as a major arms supplier.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has emerged as a staunch defender of the country, exemplified in a 2008 address to the Knesset (Israel’s parliament), in which she identified Israel’s security as an essential feature of Germany’s Staatsraison.
But Germany also appears to be increasingly uneasy about having to continue supporting Israel even when its policies are clearly reproachable.
Seventy years after the liberation of Auschwitz, can the bilateral relationship withstand the rising tide of anti-Israel sentiment in Europe?
History has its ironies.
Post-war Germany could regain international legitimacy only through reconciliation with the Jewish people.
Today, it is Israel’s legitimacy that is being challenged in international institutions and Western public opinion for its mistreatment of the Palestinians.
The role reversal has been remarkable.
Both Jews and Germans emerged from WWII as defeated and crippled peoples, but the Jews had the moral high ground, while the Germans very much did not.
Yet, in a global opinion poll conducted in 2013 by the BBC World Service, Israel ranked as one of the least popular countries – just above North Korea, Pakistan, and Iran – whereas Germany emerged as the most popular.
But the extent of this inversion is best exemplified in the increasing prevalence of obscene comparisons between Israel’s policies toward Palestine and the Nazis’ treatment of the Jews.
A study conducted by the Bertelsmann Foundation in January showed that 35% of Germans have no problem making that connection.
In what might presage a shift in the bilateral relationship, the poll also revealed that 58% of Germans believe that the past should be consigned to history, and 62% disapprove of Israel’s policies today.
Of course, Germany’s eagerness to discharge the burden of history is not new.
Back in 1998, the renowned intellectual Martin Walser publicly attacked the pervasiveness of Auschwitz in Germany’s remembrance culture, declaring that the Holocaust had become a “moral cudgel” with which to intimidate all Germans and keep them “in a perpetual state of guilt.”
Walser’s stance amounted to a desperate call to allow his country to shape a new national identity – one that reflected its resolute repudiation of fascism and adoption of democracy, rather than its highly regrettable (and regretted) history.
And it drew a standing ovation from all but one of the 1,200 illustrious members of the audience in Frankfurt’s Pauluskirche, where Walser was being awarded the German Booksellers Association Peace Prize.
The lone exception was Ignatz Bubis, the head of Germany’s Jewish community.
As Israel’s policies have become increasingly indefensible, the Germans’ will to shape national policy independent of Holocaust guilt has grown even stronger.
The poem “What Must Be Said,” written in 2012 by the late Nobel laureate Günter Grass, may be frivolous and cliché-laden, but it is no less revealing of the growing fatigue of German society with the paralyzing memory of the Holocaust.
Not only did Grass define Israel as “a threat to world peace”; he also noted that he had remained silent for so long simply because he believed that his own origins, “tarnished by a stain that can never be removed,” denied him the right to speak the truth.
Like Grass, Germans – especially the younger generations, who feel further removed from the events of WWII – are increasingly abandoning the notion that they owe it to Israel to remain its silent, steadfast supporters.
Indeed, as Israel’s right-wing government moves to bury the two-state solution for good, Germans are joining other Europeans in vocally opposing Israeli policy in Palestine.
Simply put, historic guilt is no longer adequate to compel Germany to support Israel’s wrongheaded policies – especially when those policies are victimizing another group, the Palestinians.
Israel’s current leaders should take note.
Free Speech in the Filter Age
OXFORD – Germany’s Network Enforcement Act – according to which social-media platforms like Facebook and YouTube could be fined €50 million ($63 million) for every “obviously illegal” post within 24 hours of receiving a notification – has been controversial from the start.
After it entered fully into effect in January, there was a tremendous outcry, with critics from all over the political map arguing that it was an enticement to censorship. Government was relinquishing its powers to private interests, they protested.
So, is this the beginning of the end of free speech in Germany?
Of course not.
To be sure, Germany’s Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz (or NetzDG) is the strictest regulation of its kind in a Europe that is growing increasingly annoyed with America’s powerful social-media companies.
And critics do have some valid points about the law’s weaknesses.
But the possibilities for free expression will remain abundant, even if some posts are deleted mistakenly.
The truth is that the law sends an important message: democracies won’t stay silent while their citizens are exposed to hateful and violent speech and images – content that, as we know, can spur real-life hate and violence.
Refusing to protect the public, especially the most vulnerable, from dangerous content in the name of “free speech” actually serves the interests of those who are already privileged, beginning with the powerful companies that drive the dissemination of information.
Speech has always been filtered.
In democratic societies, everyone has the right to express themselves within the boundaries of the law, but no one has ever been guaranteed an audience.
To have an impact, citizens have always needed to appeal to – or bypass – the “gatekeepers” who decide which causes and ideas are relevant and worth amplifying, whether through the media, political institutions, or protest.
The same is true today, except that the gatekeepers are the algorithms that automatically filter and rank all contributions.
Of course, algorithms can be programmed any way companies like, meaning that they may place a premium on qualities shared by professional journalists: credibility, intelligence, and coherence.
But today’s social-media platforms are far more likely to prioritize potential for advertising revenue above all else.
So the noisiest are often rewarded with a megaphone, while less polarizing, less privileged voices are drowned out, even if they are providing the smart and nuanced perspectives that can truly enrich public discussions.
If the algorithm doesn’t do the job of silencing less privileged voices, online trolls often step in, directing hateful and threatening speech at whomever they choose.
Women and minorities are particularly likely to be victims of online harassment, but anyone may be targeted.
The German blogger Richard Gutjahr, for example, became the object of conspiracy theories and the target of intense harassment after being present at two terrorist attacks within two weeks of each other.
Victims of online harassment often respond with self-censorship, and many, with their sense of security and even self-worth eroded, remove themselves from social media altogether.
In this sense, by offering blanket protections in the name of “free speech,” countries actually privilege hate speech.
But why should a victim’s rights count less than those of their bullies?
In a democracy, the rights of the many cannot come at the expense of the rights of the few.
In the age of algorithms, government must, more than ever, ensure the protection of vulnerable voices, even erring on victims’ side at times.
If already-vulnerable people are besieged by mobs of extremists and aggressors, it is entirely understandable that they will fear speaking up.
If that happens, “free speech” is dead.
Not all NetzDG critics dispute this assessment: some agree that the speech of the vulnerable does need extra protection. But they argue that the necessary protections are already in place.
After all, severe insult and incitement to hatred and violence are prohibited, and perpetrators can be prosecuted.
French President Emmanuel Macron, for example, favors focusing on strengthening the judicial system’s ability to deal with hate speech and misinformation.
But, in the digital age, speed is decisive.
The technology is instant, and online posts can be shared widely within minutes.
Democratic institutions move rather slowly – much too slowly for police and the courts to be effective in fighting trolls and online hate.
And many victims are not in any position to hire a high-quality lawyer, as Gutjahr did.
Relying on the state’s most cumbersome institutions alone is not an effective strategy for protecting free speech on today’s digital communication networks.
Hate speech and other kinds of dangerous and illegal content must be attacked at the source.
On one hand, there is a need for increased media literacy on the part of consumers, who need to be taught, from a young age, about the real-world consequences of online hate speech.
On the other hand – and this is what the NetzDG attempts to ensure – social-media platforms must ensure that their products are designed in ways that encourage responsible use.
But this is no quick fix.
On the contrary, it demands a fundamental rethink of business models that facilitate and even reward hate speech.
Firms cannot be allowed to profit from damaging content, while shrugging off responsibility for its consequences.
Instead, they must revise their algorithms more effectively and scrupulously to flag content that humans should monitor and assess, while entrenching in all of their business decisions an awareness of their responsibility in the fight for truly free speech.
This may contradict the straightforward business logic of doing whatever maximizes profit and shareholder value.
But it is, without a doubt, what is best for society. The German government is right to push companies in the proper direction.
German Reunification and the New Europe
PARIS – I began writing this column shortly after a remarkable anniversary. October 3, 1990, was the effective date for the implementation of a stunning decision taken barely a month earlier.
On August 23, East Germany’s House of Representatives, the Volkskammer, voted for unilateral adherence by the East German Länder to West Germany’s Constitution.
Article 23 of the West German Basic Law permitted this, but neither West Germany’s government nor its Parliament had been consulted!
Reunification terms were subsequently defined in a Treaty signed in Berlin on August 31, 1990, and ratified by both the East and West German parliaments on September 20.
The Peace Treaty between the two German states and the four victorious Allies was signed in Moscow on the same day, and reunification was officially proclaimed on October 3.
These events, accomplished by three actors, shook the world – and changed it forever.
The first actor was Mikhail Gorbachev, who approved the act – the opening of the border between Austria and Hungary – that triggered the chain of events leading to reunification.
And it was Gorbachev who proclaimed that Soviet forces would not intervene to support troubled communist regimes against the will of their people – a declaration aimed directly at East Germany.
The second key figure was West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who rushed into the opened breach, overriding his Allies’ caution, while the third actor was the East German people, who rushed into the streets, regardless of the risks, to demonstrate and push reunification forward.
These events had a profound impact on relations between Germany and its allies.
The United States, Great Britain, and France all seemed to think that everything was happening too fast, that international security was at risk should the new Germany not confirm its membership in NATO (which Germany finally did).
But for a few months, there were fears that Russia would demand Germany’s withdrawal from the Alliance as a condition of its agreement to reunification.
While the US masked its doubts, Great Britain and France were less at ease.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher limited herself to worried public statements, but French President François Mitterrand felt it necessary to improvise a visit to East Berlin, against the opinion of his Foreign Ministry and despite the French people’s great enthusiasm for German reunification. Mitterrand hoped to slow the process and to link negotiations to some international guarantees.
His effort was a fiasco, remembered in Berlin to this day.
The motive of Mitterrand’s “mission” was to determine what precautions could or should be taken against the potential vagaries of this powerful but unpredictable people.
The response was eventually enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, which extended the European Union’s competences to foreign affairs and judicial matters, making them partly supranational.
Great Britain and Denmark, however, insisted that these new competences be exercised on intergovernmental grounds only, not by the European Commission, and thus only through consensus.
France did not vote, so Great Britain and Denmark won by default.
Europe would take common action related to foreign affairs only on unanimous grounds.
Political Europe was stillborn at the moment of greatest potential.
This was a major disappointment for Germany, particularly as it could no longer count on France, its main ally in Europe.
In Germany itself, failure to achieve a politically integrated federal Europe baffled pro-integration political forces and dented the war generation’s moral authority.
The New Germany and its post-war generation felt tempted to recover a reunified, yet lonely, German identity, one with influence in Europe and worldwide.
As a result, reunified Germany naturally fell back on its old sphere of dominance, Eastern Europe.
But Germany’s leaders were uneasy with these changes.
In September 1994, two MPs from the majority Christian Democratic Union published a political statement on Europe, questioning its future, particularly the prospect of federalism.
A dismal silence greeted its publication, which left Germany’s pro-European establishment isolated and dispirited.
Indeed, in May 2000, Joschka Fischer, the ex-leader of the Green Party and German Foreign Minister, gave a long speech about the necessity of European integration. The question about European federalism was posed to all member states, and none answered.
France, obviously in the limelight, remained silent, again leaving Germany to feel abandoned by its partners.
A process of erosion, catalyzed by British diplomacy, was under way. It succeeded.
The prospect of genuine European integration on foreign affairs and defense issues was denied time and again, at each step of the successive negotiations for the Treaties of Amsterdam, Nice, the aborted constitutional project, and Lisbon.
Time passed, generations changed.
In today’s Germany, because no one with decisive power in business, finance, or government experienced the war, the European project is no longer viewed as conditioning Europe’s collective future.
These new leaders envision Europe only as a trade regime.
Meanwhile, German diplomacy is actively reconstructing the country’s economic and cultural spheres of influence, and not only in Eastern Europe.
The impact of this lost European perspective became clear in the autumn of 2008 when, in the aftermath of the sub-prime crisis and the failure of Lehman Brothers, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first impulse was nationalistic and wholly anti-European.
There would be no common European plan to address the crisis, and no call for public funds. Germany would protect its banks’depositors on its own and through private means.
Only the sheer gravity of the situation brought Germany back within the European realm for the subsequent G-20 meeting.
Twenty years after reunification was completed, Germany has become one of the world’s great democracies.
Many wish that it were also more European in its outlook and behavior.
But Germany does not bear the main responsibility for killing off the vision of political Europe.
Germany is Not Volkswagen
MUNICH – The Volkswagen scandal has raised questions about the German model of production.
If the success of the company’s diesel-powered vehicles was due in part to fraudulent efforts to conceal the amount of harmful pollutants they emitted, will similar revelations at other companies call into questions the country’s transformation from “the sick man of Europe” to an export-driven economic powerhouse?
Fortunately, the answer is almost certainly no.
Germany’s competitive advantage has less to do with chicanery than with how its firms are structured and the culture in which they operate.
Germany’s leading car company is an exception to the manufacturing rules that have driven the country’s success, not an example of them.
Indeed, Germany’s success is frequently cited as a model that other countries should emulate, and rightly so.
Since the beginning of the century, the country has grown to become one of the world’s leading exporters, outstripping all other major European countries.
From 2000 to 2013, Germany’s exports grew by 154%, compared to 127% for Spain, 98% for the United Kingdom, 79% for France, and 72% for Italy.
The leading explanation for Germany’s impressive recent export performance is wage restraint.
But, as a comparison with Spain reveals, faster wage growth elsewhere cannot be the entire story.
To be sure, from 2000 to 2008, German wages increased by 19%, compared to 48% in Spain.
But after the 2009 financial crisis, the roles were reversed.
From 2009 to 2013, German nominal wages increased by more than 14%, compared to 4% in Spain.
And yet, despite the more rapid rise in German wages, the country’s exports rebounded faster than Spain’s – or those of any other European Union country.
The most important factor behind Germany’s success is that the structure of its firms improves the quality of their products.
German exporters are organized in a way that is less hierarchical and more decentralized than other European firms.
This gives them several advantages.
Decentralization enables employees at lower levels of the corporate hierarchy to devise and implement new ideas.
As these employees are often closer to customers than those higher up, their collective knowledge about what the market is demanding is an important source of value.
Tapping this knowledge allows Germany to compete on quality, not price.
Indeed, if wage restraint were the main factor in Germany’s success, it would be hard pressed to outperform French, Italian, British, and Spanish exporters, who compete mainly on price by offshoring production to low-wage countries.
Instead, the German focus on quality allows its firms to charge higher prices and gain new customers.
When exporters are asked to rank their products relative to a market average, 40% of German exporters classify their goods as top quality, while only 10% of French exporters do so.
Decentralized management has helped German exporters triple their share of the global market for top-quality goods compared to those firms that did not reorganize.
Indeed, when I studied the top 1% of German exporters – the country’s export superstars – I found that they more than doubled their share of the world export market when they opted to decentralize their organizations.
This focus on quality could explain why German exports rebounded quickly after 2009, despite the rise in nominal wages.
Quality makes exporters less vulnerable to changes in price – including those driven by rising wages.
By contrast, those countries in which firms compete on price may have felt more pressure to move production abroad as domestic wages rose.
Germany’s relative insensitivity to rising costs could also explain why its government is comfortable with a strong euro, whereas France and Italy have been calling on the European Central Bank to weaken the currency.
Volkswagen, it turns out, took a different approach from that of most other German firms.
Rather than decentralizing power, CEO Martin Winterkorn sat at the head of a centralized, command-and-control organization in which he acted as a patriarch.
His desire to take the company to the very top of the global car industry, surpassing Toyota, put enormous strain on his managers to deliver growth.
The result – a decision to cheat on emissions tests – says less about Germany’s culture of manufacturing than about rot at the car company, beginning at the very top.
According to the World Value Survey, Germany is a high-trust society, in which citizens have confidence in one another’s behavior and act accordingly.
Indeed, the lesson of the Volkswagen scandal is that this culture may be necessary for its export model to work.
French and Italian exporters that introduced decentralized management did not increase their share of the global market for top-quality goods. The likely reason is that providing division managers with greater autonomy not only frees them up to respond to market demands; it also allows them to put their own career interests above the wellbeing of the firm.
If Germany is to maintain its economic dominance, it will have to do something far harder than keeping wages in check or restructuring hierarchies.
It will have to ensure that the culture of integrity underlying its success remains unchanged by the pressures of global competition.
Germany’s Bland Grand Coalition
MUNICH – Germany’s Social Democrats (SPD), the Christian Democratic Union, and the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have agreed to pursue another “grand coalition” government, and have published a 28-page agreement outlining their proposed policy agenda.
The agreement comes months after an election in which the SPD and CDU/CSU advanced rather different economic-policy views.
Whereas the SPD has focused on the need for more redistribution and public spending, the CDU/CSU has promised “tax cuts for all” and a more restrictive refugee policy.
The question now is whether a coalition comprising such ideologically divergent forces can truly prepare Germany for the challenges that await it.
In the months and years ahead, German policymakers will need to manage the transition into the digital era, in order to preserve the country’s competitiveness.
They must also stabilize the welfare state at a time of rapid population aging.
And they must develop a rational migration policy.
On top of this full domestic agenda, many are looking to Germany to keep the European Union together.
As many commentators have pointed out, Germany’s new government will benefit from a budget surplus, because the booming economy, coupled with peculiarities of the German tax code, has boosted government revenues over the last four years.
Even by pursuing the balanced-budget policy described in its provisional coalition agreement, the government will have room either for more spending or tax cuts amounting to €46 billion ($56 billion) – around 0.3% of GDP – over four years.
According to the coalition agreement, €36 billion of the surplus will be allocated to various outlays such as transfers to families, higher agricultural and regional subsidies, housing-construction incentives, roads and related infrastructure, universities and school buildings, and even the military.
That leaves just €10 billion for tax cuts, which will take the form of reductions in the solidarity surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag), a special income tax that was introduced in 1991 to finance German reunification.
The grand coalition envisions abolishing this tax for everyone except the top 10% of earners, who generate more than half of the revenue from it.
But when one considers the effects of “bracket creep,” the outlook for taxpayers worsens.
Unlike most other developed countries, Germany’s tax system lacks an automatic adjustment mechanism to prevent inflation from pushing households into higher tax brackets.
And while discretionary adjustments do take place, they hardly provide full compensation to countless households that end up paying more tax than they should.
In fact, at the current rate of bracket creep, Germany’s tax revenues will increase by roughly €50 billion over the next four years.
Halving the solidarity surcharge no earlier than 2021 will come nowhere close to offsetting that.
All told, nobody is particularly enthusiastic about the coalition agreement, including the SPD.
Despite the coalition agreement’s emphasis on spending, the SPD fears that participating in another grand coalition will further damage its public standing, and drive more of its voters into the arms of the radical left or the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).
For others, the problem is not politics, but the agenda itself: for all of its specific provisions, it achieves very little.
When spread over four years, an additional €2 billion spent on defense, €600 million on universities, and €4 billion on housing will make little difference.
And while the coalition’s plan also promises higher contributions to the EU budget and more spending on the mothers’ pension and low-income households, it does not specify how those increases will be reconciled with a balanced budget.
More fundamentally, the agenda lacks ambition and direction.
It neither provides significant relief to the middle class through tax cuts, nor allocates adequate investment for research, infrastructure, or education.
And it makes no mention of corporate taxation, even though rate cuts in the United States, and planned cuts in France and the United Kingdom, will inevitably lure investment and jobs away from Germany.
A truly bold policy agenda would require the new government to focus on specific priorities and accept that not everyone can get what they want.
Rather than tweaking the margins in a futile attempt to please everyone, the government would set its sights on deeper structural reforms, to lay the foundation for future growth and stability.
For example, Germany spends billions of euros every year on green-energy subsidies.
But as the provisional coalition agreement acknowledges, Germany will likely fall short of its target for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 2020, suggesting that these subsidies have not worked.
Fundamental reforms in this area could make Germany’s climate policies both cheaper and more effective.
But doing that would require the government to abandon its ideological position and challenge powerful interest groups.
Nevertheless, the coalition agreement does include some promising ideas.
For example, it proposes a program to attract skilled workers, and to align Germany’s immigration policies with its economic interests.
And although the new government should attach conditions to Germany’s larger EU budget contribution, in order to prevent wasteful spending, its clear commitment to the EU should be welcomed.
There is still time for the coalition partners to revise their program.
Surely, they should want to do more than use the current economic upswing to provide piddling handouts to various constituencies (except those paying the most in taxes, of course).
Now is the time to start preparing Germany for its future challenges.
Freeing German Democracy
BERLIN – The spectacle surrounding the recent talks to form a new coalition government in Germany is a bellwether of voter discontent.
The power games, pork barreling, and compromises that have been reached without public debate all underscore the disconnect between Germany’s mainstream parties and the electorate – driving voters directly into the hands of populists.
As a result, Germany’s political fringe is blossoming.
The far-right Alternative für Deutschland and the left-wing Die Linke hold a combined total of about a quarter of the Bundestag’s seats.
The emerging grand coalition – which includes the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the left-leaning Social Democratic Party (SPD) – holds just over 50%, making it significantly less grand than in the previous two governments.
The AfD, in particular, can’t believe its luck.
The party – which is, at best, only partly loyal to democracy – appears set to become the largest opposition group in the Bundestag.
For a party that did not even qualify for parliamentary representation until last September’s election, such a prominent position was beyond their wildest dreams.
Should the grand coalition take the helm, as expected, the parliament of affluent and economically stable Germany would confront the same type of divisiveness that, by shifting power to the fringes and shrinking the political center, has weakened democracy in other countries.
This has already occurred in the United States, where the emergence of more extreme voices has undermined cooperation between Republicans and Democrats, as well as in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Belgium.
This is not to say that the Bundestag will suddenly become as dysfunctional as today’s US Congress.
But the seeds of democratic paralysis are being planted.
In some ways, this situation has been a long time coming.
Under previous grand coalitions, the Bundestag has served less as a platform for open discussion of diverse views and preferred outcomes than as a machine for passing laws.
The emerging coalition’s 167-page agreement, which spells out in striking detail the future government’s agenda, indicates that the authorities’ focus during the next four years will, once again, be confined to enacting previously agreed policies, not on promoting deliberation and reflection on public issues.
This closed-door policy has deepened the divide between the political class and voters.
As for what is driving it, there are two culprits: the rise of coalition agreements and the changing party system.
A coalition agreement spelling out some of the main items for the upcoming legislative period was used first by the CDU and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the early 1960s. A coalition committee was established to ensure that the agreed measures made it through parliament.
Over time, however, such agreements became increasingly detailed and complex; what had been a road map became a contract.
The coalition committee, meanwhile, became increasingly powerful behind the scenes.
These developments, though controversial, were never fully challenged; on the contrary, they became de rigueur for legislative politics in Germany, causing the Bundestag to shift focus from conducting open debate to enacting previously agreed decisions.
Until a few years ago, this shift in focus for the Bundestag was not particularly problematic.
But the main political parties have lately been losing their foothold in local communities, with the CDU/CSU and the SPD now relying on significantly lower membership.
As a result, their decisions have become increasingly detached from the will of the people.
The CDU and CSU leadership, not bound by a party vote, have already signaled their acceptance of the coalition pact.
But one hopes that SPD members reject the agreement on which they are now voting (the postal ballot closes on March 2).
A failed agreement would probably bring greater political instability, but it would ultimately strengthen German democracy.
If the agreement fails, Germany might hold a fresh election – a risky option, to be sure, as recent polls indicate that the AfD could win an even larger share of the vote, while support for the CDU and the SPD could decline.
Alternatively, Chancellor Angela Merkel could lead a minority government – the first in the Federal Republic’s nearly 70-year history – which would have to submit every policy proposal for parliamentary debate, with the risk of being blocked.
Under a minority government, every debate could lead to the government’s fall.
Yet this could work well for many less controversial proposals, while creating a new tradition of shifting, rather than fixed, coalitions.
Over time, such an arrangement could bring significant advantages, even institutional innovations, with the potential to challenge the stifling practice of coalition agreements and closed-door committees to enforce them.
German democracy is being strangled by strict coalition contracts.
In order to allow it to breathe, while closing the gap between the political class and the electorate, Germans must focus on creating more open and flexible legislative agendas that require genuine debate, out in the open, in the Bundestag.
The Politics of Germany’s External Surplus
MUNICH – The debate about global macroeconomic imbalances is increasingly focusing on Germany’s current-account surplus and economic policy.
Despite the vitality of the German economic engine, and the role it plays in fueling growth and maintaining stability in the eurozone, criticism of the country’s massive external surplus is mounting.
As the Economist put it recently, Germany “saves too much and spends too little,” making it “an awkward defender of free trade.”
So what is Germany to do?
The answer depends on whether economics, or politics, is guiding the decision-making.
The current criticism, which provided what one observer called an “uneasy ambiance” at this month’s G20 summit in Hamburg, focuses on two claims.
First, Germany is hurting itself by exporting too much and investing too little at home.
Second, Germany withholds demand from the rest of the world, in particular the US.
If Germany contributed more to global spending, according to this view, the economic recovery from the 2008 financial crisis would have been stronger.
But the truth is, there is no compelling economic reason for Germany to do anything differently.
If Germany has any reason to change course, it is primarily for political reasons.
The first criticism – that Germany’s domestic spending has not kept pace with its investment needs – is a myth.
Exposés about poorly built buildings and crumbling bridges are offered as evidence that thrift has overtaken reason.
But the numbers tell a different story.
From 2001 to 2005, for example, Germany’s average current-account surplus was 2.4% of GDP, and average domestic investment was just under 20% of GDP.
During the five-year period that ended in 2016, the surplus climbed to 7.3% of GDP, but investment remained constant at 20%.
(Germany’s domestic spending was significantly higher in the 1990s, but that was largely the result of German reunification, and was not sustainable.)
The surplus has surged for one reason: prudence.
Germany faces the prospect of a fiscal crisis as its population ages and its workforce shrinks.
It needs to prepare for a projected decline in pension contributions and growth in health-care costs.
Whereas the public-sector deficit was 3% of GDP in the early 2000s, Germany runs a small surplus today, which is a perfectly reasonable reaction, as is the increase in private retirement savings.
At the moment, it makes more sense to invest the additional savings abroad, because population aging in Germany limits the potential for useful investment at home, and other markets are growing faster.
Critics’ second point, that Germany is stingy with its global purchasing, is more complicated.
Germany certainly could help struggling eurozone economies if it bought more of their goods and services.
But more imports and a lower surplus would also drive up interest rates, which is bad for highly indebted countries.
In fiscal policy, as in national security, it is perfectly normal for a country to place its own interests ahead of others.
But the global pressure might nonetheless move German Chancellor Angela Merkel for at least three reasons – all of them political, not economic.
First, Germany has a strong interest in international cooperation in many areas, from immigration to energy security.
Making concessions on macroeconomic policy could lead to cooperation in other fields.
For Merkel, a “Germany first” approach, akin to US President Donald Trump’s “America First” strategy, would be counterproductive.
Second, debtors rarely look upon their creditors with sympathy.
Germany’s creditor position vis-à-vis other countries may lead to political conflicts, because the debtors have incentives to avoid repayment.
Third, the European Union’s Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure, established to prevent destabilizing economic policies by individual member states, requires countries with a current-account surplus above 6% of GDP to make adjustments.
Germany can hardly expect other countries to comply with EU rules if it ignores them itself.
Whether Merkel chooses to act remains to be seen, but there are plenty of options if she does.
For example, Germany could try to stimulate domestic consumption through more rapid wage increases.
But, aside from the minimum wage, the government does not set pay scales.
And while raising the minimum wage would boost income for those who have jobs, it could also increase unemployment.
As a result, overall consumption might even decline.
Another option would be to increase public spending in military procurement and infrastructure, though military procurement is a long-term process, and more infrastructure investment would be difficult at a time when the construction industry is running at full capacity.
It would probably be easier to boost corporate investment, such as by introducing accelerated depreciation, tax credits to promote research and development, and more generous loss-offset provisions.
Indeed, boosting domestic private investment through corporate tax reform seems the best option.
But, in terms of addressing global macroeconomic imbalances, Germany’s critics will be disappointed by such measures.
Germany represents 4.4% of global GDP.
So a reduction in its external surplus, even by as much as 2.5 percentage points from the current level of 8.5% of GDP, would have a minimal impact on the global economy.
An increase in demand equal to 2.5% of German GDP would boost global demand by just 0.1%.
The world would lose a scapegoat for its economic difficulties.
Little else would change.
The Visible Hand of Economic Prosperity
FRANKFURT – Germany has weathered the financial crisis much better than most of its neighbors.
Regarded as the sick man of Europe as recently as 1999, today the country boasts the continent's strongest economy, accounting for roughly a quarter of its exports.
Its unemployment rate, at just below 5%, is half the European average.
The federal budget is balanced for the first time in a decade.
But it would be a mistake to assume that Germany's economic performance vindicates its policymaking.
In fact, Germany's current economic dominance has been built on a policy framework that stands in direct opposition to that championed by former Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, the father of its post-World War II “economic miracle."
In lieu of Erhard's so-called ordoliberalism – in which the state lays the groundwork for a functioning market economy by actively managing the legal environment – the economic strategy pursued by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has been haphazard, driven more by political expediency than by any underlying philosophy.
Germany would be wise not to take its economic success for granted.
In a time of increasing economic and political uncertainty, Erhard's guiding principles are more important than ever.
Indeed, Germany's policymakers seem to be stumbling from decision to decision.
Instead of steering the economy, they are being driven by it, reacting with no clear sense of direction to the demands of the moment.
The country's celebrated de-carbonization is putting its industry at risk.
Collective bargaining, once left to economic actors, is becoming increasingly politicized.
Changes in pension policy are boosting public spending and contributing to rising levels of debt.
At the heart of Germany's troubles is the stubborn – and internationally widespread – idea that the economy is a large, clock-like mechanism into which the state can intervene without consequences.
The increasing mathematization of economics in recent decades has abetted this development.
The central weakness of democratic systems also contributes to the problem: The quest for votes favors the extension of social benefits and discourages unpopular measures that would put the economy on a more sustainable footing.
As the German economist Herbert Giersch once put it, what is politically expedient is rarely economically beneficial.
It is for this reason that a return to ordoliberalism is more important than ever.
Erhard's objective was to counter political pragmatism and activism with an orderly vision of economic and social policy.
The need to take a holistic view of the economy was self-evident.
For today's social engineers and economists, this is no longer the case.
Erhard's vision of a social market economy was a third way, an alternative to both large-scale state intervention and the risks of laissez-faire liberalism.
Germany's historical experience had demonstrated that freedom without order led to chaos, and order without freedom resulted in coercion and the renunciation of democracy.
Unguided capitalism undermined itself, according to Erhard, as monopolists cornered markets and captured the state.
But the attempt to perfect life through increasingly comprehensive state intervention, until even the smallest injustices were compensated, was also bound to fail.
Human society simply does not follow the rules of a termite colony; order must accommodate freedom and individuality.
The continuing relevance of Erhard's ideas can be seen in the growing number of protest movements – strengthened by social networks – challenging the market economy and neoliberalism.
Any increase in the market's perceived legitimacy brought about by the failure of communism was temporary at best.
Market-oriented policies today are seen as cold and anti-social, especially in Western industrialized countries.
The paternalistic welfare state is viewed as more humane, despite the loss of freedom and the financial distortions associated with it.
Erhard was well aware of the tension between economic freedom and the democratic state.
He and his followers never envisaged ordoliberalism as an unchangeable dogma, but rather as a model that could be adapted to new challenges.
Erhard even attempted to adjust it to the sociopolitical changes of the 1960s, developing the concept of a “formed society," whereby factionalism would be minimized and the state governed by consensus.
Erhard failed to gain support for this controversial idea.
But, given rising inequality and growing disenchantment with politics and political parties, it addresses questions that remain relevant for representative democracy today.
As Erhard himself would have argued, ordoliberalism is not a one-size-fits-all solution.
But there can be no question that in today's globalized world, the economy – and perhaps politics as well – would benefit from the imposition of order.
No political system capable of overcoming hardship and misery can be built without first realizing improvements in the economy's potential.
That must be achieved by minimizing state intervention, bureaucracy, and privileges for the chosen few.
Erhard's guiding principle was simple: there must be guiding principles.
It is an idea that remains as important as ever – in Germany and beyond.
The Battle for Germany’s Soul
STOCKHOLM – One year after the death of former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the country he led for 16 years seems to be struggling with whether or not to follow his legacy.
For Kohl, Germany’s history and central position in Europe meant that it must never pursue national greatness as an end in itself.
To his mind, the country with more neighbors than any other country on the continent should not throw its weight around.
Rather, it should uphold an idea of Europe in which all countries, large and small, feel equally secure.
But since the start of the refugee crisis in the fall of 2015, Kohl’s vision of Europe has been under attack.
While Chancellor Angela Merkel has continued to press for cooperative migration and refugee policies within the European Union, a growing chorus of voices in Germany is advocating unilateral action that would most likely come at the expense of other EU member states.
On the surface, the debate consuming Germany nowadays is about whether to turn away asylum seekers who have already been registered in other EU countries, as the federal interior minister, Horst Seehofer of the Christian Social Union (CSU), has advocated.
But at a deeper level, the question for Germany is whether it should go it alone or continue to seek common European solutions.
In this new age of identity politics, the dispute over immigration has become a battle for Germany’s soul.
Last September, the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) became the first far-right party since the 1960s to enter the German Bundestag.
Then, after the formation of the current grand coalition government, the AfD became the main opposition party.
And now it is pushing the CSU further to the right in the lead-up to Bavaria’s regional election this October.
These developments in Germany are in keeping with trends across Europe, where nationalist and populist parties have made electoral gains by rejecting EU-level solutions and calling for closed borders.
In Italy, the nationalist League party appears to be calling the shots in its new governing coalition with the populist Five Star Movement.
And in Austria, the far-right Freedom Party is exerting its influence on migration policies as a member of the governing coalition.
If one were to listen to these parties’ rhetoric, one might think that refugees and migrants are pouring into Europe unhindered.
But while the Balkans did become a highway for asylum seekers fleeing Syria for Germany and Sweden in 2015 and 2016, that route was effectively closed down when Turkey agreed to host refugees in exchange for EU financial aid.
And though the refugee situation in the Central Mediterranean continues to make headlines, the number of migrants crossing from North Africa has actually declined sharply over the past year.
Still, immigration has remained a hot-button issue across Europe, owing to the shock of the initial refugee crisis, which still reverberates in voters’ minds.
Politics is about perceptions, not raw numbers.
And populist and nationalist parties have managed to paint a picture of a Europe under siege.
In the current political environment, if Germany were to send refugees back to Austria, then Austria would almost certainly send them back to Italy.
But that would take the EU back to the same situation that it was in before, when asylum seekers were not being registered on arrival in Italy, and when it was all the more difficult to turn them back at other borders.
Inevitably, the situation would degenerate into a volatile mess, with EU member states pitted against one another, and populists commanding center stage.
Kohl’s Germany, by contrast, would consider the European dimension of its policies and shape them accordingly.
It would not simply dump its national problems on its smaller neighbors, because it would recognize that their security is synonymous with its own.
The attack on Kohl’s vision by nationalist forces could have ramifications well beyond the immigration debate.
At stake is not just Germany’s role in Europe, but also the future of European integration.
A Germany that abandons Kohl’s legacy would suddenly become a source of deep uncertainty, rather than a bastion of stability at the center of Europe.
With the West already under attack by the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump, that is the last thing Europe needs.
To be sure, the immediate crisis will most likely be resolved through a series of imperfect compromises – both at the EU level and within Germany’s governing coalition.
That, after all, is often how the EU works, as in the case of the Greek sovereign-debt crisis.
The matter is unlikely to end there.
German wavering on Kohl’s legacy is a trend that is larger than any single issue.
But how the refugee debate plays out in the coming weeks will reveal much about Germany’s future direction – and about the future of Europe.
Germany’s Great European Heist
NEW YORK – Two mantras guide German thinking about eurozone integration: responsibilities and control must be aligned (so no mutualization of risk without shared jurisdiction); and legacy risks must be settled before any pooling of risks among euro members takes place.
Since 2010, these two refrains have shaped the entire discussion of how to shore up the euro, and they largely account for the anemic progress being made on the creation of a European banking union.
Germany is ready to embark on a common future, its leaders say, but only if Europe starts from a clean slate.
At first sight, that proposition seems reasonable enough.
But to understand its full implications, try applying the same logic to another policy field: security and defense.
What if France applied Germany’s approach to eurozone integration to the question of mutualizing defense commitments?
What if the French were to insist, as an absolute precondition for further security cooperation, that Germany not only increase its defense budget immediately, but also make good on its accumulated backlog in defense spending from recent decades?
Germany has not always been a free rider on other people’s defense spending.
West Germany was a reliable player in NATO’s Cold War system of burden sharing, and the Bundeswehr in the 1980s was a capable force.
For better or worse, it stood in the tradition of German armies since the Kaiserreich.
National service was the norm.
Defense spending ran at 3% of GDP.
Then came the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
Germany embraced the peace dividend with a vengeance.
Reductions in Germany’s armed forces and disavowal of weapons of mass destruction were written into the treaties that reunified Germany.
But demilitarization also reflected societal shifts.
Something in the political culture of the Federal Republic had changed.
More and more young men chose civilian over military service.
In 2011, conscription was suspended.
As a practical matter, that decision probably should have come sooner.
Today’s best-functioning militaries are professional, not conscripted.
But, in Germany, no positive image of the Bundeswehr’s new role emerged from the end of the Cold War model.
Morale and functional capacity collapsed along with spending.
At NATO meeting after NATO meeting, Germany would commit to spending 2% of its GDP on defense.
It never delivered.
Spending slumped toward 1% of GDP, with the majority going to salaries and pensions.
The latest NATO data show German spending on defense equipment and on research and development running at only 0.17% of GDP in 2017, compared to 0.42% in France and 0.47% in the UK.
Germany’s dearth of military investment has created a daunting gap between its defense capacity and that of the rest of Europe.
Only a fraction of Germany’s weapons and military vehicles are operational.
On Europe’s eastern border, only nine of the 44 tanks promised for the Bundeswehr unit that is supposed to anchor NATO’s 5,000-strong rapid-reaction force in the Baltics next year are fit for use.
The unit also lacks other equipment essential for the mission, such as tents, winter clothing, night vision equipment, and body armor.
For the German left, which opposes the use of hard power, there is no reason to lament this lack of resources.
But the gutting of the Bundeswehr also disables Germany’s ability to exercise soft power.
In 2014, Germany’s humanitarian team to deliver assistance to Ebola-stricken Liberia was stranded in the Canary Islands.
The German Navy’s large supply ships – those most useful for refugee rescue operations in the Mediterranean – will be out of commission for 18 months, owing to a lack of spare parts.
If the Bundeswehr’s guns don’t work, its frigates are in dry dock, and its logistical capacity is zero; what other commitments might the French taxpayer be taking on?
By agreeing, year after year, to the mutualization of defense costs, what sort of incentives is France providing to Germany to undertake reform?
If the French were to apply a simple spending rule, they would find that since 1990 they had cumulatively spent 30% of GDP more than Germany on defense.
If what the Germans are most interested in is France’s nuclear deterrence, the costs over the same period total approximately 4.5-5 % of French GDP.
So the legacy issues are considerable.
Furthermore, given Germany’s ingrained post-military habits, backsliding is to be expected.
What is French President Emmanuel Macron to make of the German budget announced earlier this month, which shows a marginal increase in defense spending but not enough to meet the NATO target, let alone to close past deficits?
German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s new grand coalition government may not look like a reliable security partner, but does that mean France should hold out until Germany has made good on its legacy defense debt before considering defense investments and mutualization in Europe?
Europe’s need to develop a twenty-first century security strategy is urgent, not only because Donald Trump’s America is unreliable, but also because humanitarian emergencies demand it.
It must develop a shared culture and build democratic governance to decide on the deployment of its defense forces.
That will involve deep cultural and political adjustments on all sides.
Both Germany’s habit of free riding and France’s tendency toward trigger-happy postcolonial forays will have to be debated.
These issues are at the heart of developing a European sovereign, backed by democratic institutions and decision-making processes that enable the common use of force.
But Europe cannot start from some imaginary tabula rasa. It must start from the place to which history has brought it.
The quid pro quo that France should demand for cooperation on security policy is that Germany recognizes the same reality with regard to economic policy.
Here, too, the past must be taken as given.
Starting positions are unequal and incentive structures are imperfect.
But Europe must agree to move forward together nonetheless, or risk being torn apart.
Germany, Europe, and Russia
European unity is indivisible.
When one nation is intimidated or ostracized, all are not free.
Every aspect of our shared culture, if not the last century of shared suffering, confirms that for us.
So a prime objective of the European Union is to promote stability and security through a dynamic structure of economic and political inter-dependence in which all nations have a vested interest.
But such a structure is lacking today between the EU and Russia, to the detriment of all the countries that lie between them.
Thus it is vitally important that Germany has made this a central issue for its EU presidency, which is just beginning.
With high prices for crude oil and natural gas bloating its coffers, Russia is once again aggressively confronting the small and still relatively weak states that fled the eroding Soviet empire 15 years ago.
Given the residual economic and institutional ties born of the Soviet era, Russia’s external influence in this region remains enormous.
But Russia is also now extending its grasp of energy markets beyond those of its immediate neighbors.
Europe’s relationship with Russia is too important for it to be developed in an ad hoc fashion through bilateral arrangements.
Today is Europe’s moment of maximum flexibility; as dependence on Russian energy supplies grows, the EU’s leverage weakens.
So Europe’s strategy cannot be to take the historically well-trodden path of least resistance.
Unfortunately, in the aftermath of the Cold War, it has often been assumed that Russia’s hostile intentions have disappeared, and foreign policy toward Russia has been conducted as if traditional diplomatic considerations no longer apply.
But, of course, they do apply.
Encouraging economic and political reform are important objectives, but they can never serve as a substitute for a serious effort to contain Russia’s deep-seated expansionism.
To be sure, Russia has legitimate security interests in what has been called its “near abroad.”
But Europe’s stability and commitment to economic growth across the continent require that these interests be satisfied without economic pressure or unilateral intervention.
A viable Russia policy for Europe must recognize Europe’s growing dependence on Russian energy resources.
To proceed otherwise would discount the most important question: the reliability of Russia as an energy supplier.
Despite controlling the world’s largest gas reserves, Russia’s state-owned monopoly Gazprom is not producing enough for an economy growing at 6% a year.
Gazprom’s three largest fields, which account for three-quarters of its output, are in decline.
This domestic shortage means that Gazprom is unable to increase supply to Europe, at least in the short term, unless it can buy gas at below-market rates from its Eastern European and Central Asian neighbors and in turn sell it to its European customers at market prices.
At the same time, Russia wants to cater to other markets, notably along its eastern frontier.
The problem is not a lack of reserves, but Gazprom’s investment strategy.
In recent years, the company has spent vigorously on everything but developing its reserves.
It has built or is building pipelines to Turkey and Germany, taken over an oil company, and sought footholds in European distribution markets.
Instead of investing in discovering oil, Gazprom has become the biggest media group in Russia.
All this is done in the name of creating and supporting a national energy champion which also serves as a foreign policy arm of the Kremlin.
Meanwhile, with investment in Gazprom’s core activity – production – steadily declining, a crisis is looming, one that requires the stewardship and steady hand of the EU.
Gazprom’s ambitions for gaining control of pipeline and energy transport infrastructure must be slowed, which requires allowing independent producers to prosper.
Indeed, independent producers already account for 20% of domestic gas sales in Russia.
To boost their output and allow them direct access to European markets will require market-based incentives.
Europe can help by insisting that Russia participate in the European Energy Charter, which calls for Gazprom to grant its production competitors access to Russian pipelines, and for all disputes to be settled by international arbitration.
European competition policy, which successfully brought giant companies like Microsoft into line to promote competition, could help to turn Gazprom into a normal competitor, too.
Europe’s leaders should engage in frank discussions about where European and Russian interests converge or differ, and these discussions should include regional neighbors that are both producer and transit nations, like my own country, Ukraine.
Moscow will understand a policy based on mutual respect for each other’s interests better than simple appeals to goodwill and friendship.
Russia should be welcome in institutions and agreements that foster cooperation, with reciprocal rights and responsibilities.
Russian reform will be impeded, not nurtured, by turning a blind eye to political and economic aggression.
The hard-fought independence of the former Soviet republics must not be tacitly traded away in acquiescence to Russia’s desire for regional hegemony.
Russia’s leaders are entitled to the world’s understanding as they struggle to overcome generations of Soviet misrule.
But they are not entitled to the sphere of influence that Russian tsars and commissars coveted for 300 years.
If Russia is to be a serious partner for Europe, it must be ready to accept the obligations of stability along with the benefits.
If Europe is to ensure its prosperity and energy security, it must demand nothing less.
The Art of the Surplus
BERLIN – Germany’s persistently high current-account surplus may not be on the official agenda of this week’s G20 summit in Hamburg, but it is bound to provoke tensions among the assembled leaders.
After all, that surplus, which has long been a bone of contention for many of Germany’s trade partners, hit a new high of 8.3% of nominal GDP last year, with the surplus vis-à-vis the United States accounting for the largest share.
To be sure, Germany’s economy could benefit from policy changes that would also reduce the current-account surplus.
But such adjustments make sense only if guided by sober reasoning – and by leaders who accept the mutually beneficial nature of international trade, allow economic adjustment to occur over time, and reject the illusion that an economy is akin to a large company.
International trade is not a zero-sum game.
A current-account deficit is not a straightforward indication of “a bad deal,” and a surplus is not necessarily a cause for celebration.
Instead, they are the outcomes of myriad private deals, from which the parties involved expect to reap benefits.
Yet US President Donald Trump’s administration and (less pugnaciously) the European Commission continue to push the narrative that Germany’s high surplus must indicate a macroeconomic imbalance caused by low aggregate demand, relative to supply.
Trump, displaying his lack of understanding of the economic concepts involved in measuring current-account balances – went so far as to say that “the Germans are bad, very bad,” because of “the millions of cars they are selling to the US.”
The reality is that, for there to be a macroeconomic imbalance, aggregate demand would have to deviate significantly from aggregate supply at a given price level.
Excess supply would be reflected either in heavily underutilized production capacity or in dramatic declines in both prices and price expectations.
None of this is currently evident in Germany.
On the contrary, German production capacity is over-utilized.
Employment levels are high, and unemployment is decreasing.
Prices are rising, somewhat, and core inflation rates have been positive for years.
Given this, any intervention aimed at stimulating demand – the obvious remedy, according to the Trump narrative – would hardly make sense.
There are more problems with the simplistic narrative being pushed by Germany’s Western partners.
A current-account surplus is often interpreted as a sign of an intentionally undervalued currency, trade barriers, or the dumping of export goods.
But the German economy is characterized by relatively low trade barriers; wage-setting is largely independent of politics; and monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, not the German government.
Rather than such persistent factors, it seems that temporary forces may bear much of the blame for Germany’s high current-account surplus.
Most important, the ECB’s expansionary monetary policy, while arguably indispensable to fending off the euro crisis, has driven down the euro’s value; the corresponding improvement in price competitiveness since mid-2014 accounted for at least one percentage point of Germany’s current-account surplus in 2016.
The dramatic decline in oil prices between 2014 and 2016 is associated with an increase of another two percentage points, with demographic shifts contributing two more.
An examination of net borrowing and lending by Germany’s economic sectors yields another explanation for the country’s high external surplus.
The German corporate sector is recording increasing capital ratios, mainly owing to tax factors and the creation of risk buffers in response to both the 2008 global financial crisis and the eurozone crisis that erupted two years later.
Not surprisingly, this rise in corporate savings has been accompanied by stepped-up investment abroad.
Germany’s public finances have also improved in recent years, and households have undergone significant consolidation to deal with the large amounts of debt that resulted from the real-estate bubble of the late 1990s.
Most of these influences – and the contribution they make to the current-account surplus – are bound to vanish over time.
The final economic truth that Trump, in particular, must recognize is that national economies cannot be managed like large firms.
The high level of abstraction in macroeconomic analysis often obscures the fact that aggregate outcomes are the result of an enormous number of discretionary decisions by independent actors.
Policymakers cannot manipulate such outcomes at will.
All they can do is shape the environment in which individual decision-makers operate, in an attempt to guide the macroeconomic aggregate, while limiting unintended side effects.
Ultimately, a current-account surplus should be understood as a symptom of underlying developments, not as a target for economic policy.
In Germany’s case, the goal shouldn’t be to address the current-account balance for the sake of it, but rather to increase the level of return on investment inside Germany.
Such measures could include, for example, pursuing an energy transition guided by economic principles, corporate-tax reforms that support funding neutrality, and the deregulation of the cosseted service sector.
Higher public investment could play a positive role as well, though it should be primarily at the expense of public consumption.
Such a policy package could boost Germany’s potential growth, while also reducing the current-account surplus.
That’s a deal that even Trump could get behind.
A Test for Europe’s German Anchor
BERLIN – The outcome of Germany’s federal election holds a crucial lesson for the European Union: even the country that has been the EU’s bedrock of stability amid crisis is not immune to political fragmentation and polarization.
Although Chancellor Angela Merkel will almost certainly gain a fourth term, her new government is likely to be considerably weaker than the three that preceded it.
The Bundestag now counts six factions, compared to four in the previous electoral term.
Merkel’s center-right Christian Democratic Union took 33% of the vote, its worst result since 1949, though still enough to give the CDU the most seats in parliament.
The center-left Social Democrats (SPD) – Germany’s second-largest political party, and a part of Merkel’s last governing coalition – also hit a post-war low, receiving just 20.5% of the vote.
Meanwhile, the populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) won 12.6%, making this anti-euro, pro-Russia, and staunchly xenophobic party the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag in almost 60 years.
And the SPD has thrown in the towel, vowing to spend the coming electoral term in opposition.
In this context, Germany is likely to be ruled by a so-called Jamaica coalition, named for the colors of the parties – the CDU, the Greens, and the Free Democrats (FDP) – that would comprise it.
But such a coalition will be unruly, owing to the parties’ heterogeneous foreign-policy positions.
Similarly, the SPD-led opposition will be beset by deep divisions.
Indeed, it is unlikely to cooperate on any issue at all with its fellow opposition party, the AfD.
The SPD shares almost no values with the AfD, which has already declared that its main goal will be to hound the other parties with populist and nationalist bombast.
As a result, decades-old parliamentary norms of decorum and collegiality are in jeopardy.
Given the Bundestag’s central role in shaping Germany’s EU policy, this could weaken the capacity of Merkel’s government to provide the kind of leadership Europe now needs.
To be sure, there is some good news.
The victory of Merkel’s CDU, however weak, implies elements of continuity on which to build.
Merkel’s prompt decision to take responsibility for forming a viable coalition government means that her commitment to preserving the EU and her staunch defense of democracy and Western values will continue to guide German policymaking.
Moderation, stability, and international openness will remain Germany’s watchwords, no matter how much ugly rhetoric the AfD spews.
But, in terms of action on international challenges, Germany’s partners will have to be patient.
In particular, though Merkel is expected to cooperate closely with France’s pro-European president, Emmanuel Macron, to forge a new model of EU integration for the post-Brexit age, she is unlikely to do so right away.
The formation of a coalition alone – in particular, a conservative-liberal-green coalition – will likely take months.
Next month’s state election in Lower Saxony, where the AfD secured significant support, adds another element of uncertainty to the mix.
Even after that election, compromise may not come easily.
The Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) – the CDU’s sister party – will face a state election next autumn.
Feeling the hot breath of the AfD on its neck, the CSU has already sharpened its criticism of Merkel’s immigration policy, and is likely to try to push the chancellor further to the right in the coming year.
Perhaps the stickiest issue for the coalition parties will be the eurozone.
The stances of the FDP and the Greens are opposed on this front, particularly when it comes to joint crisis management, mutual insurance mechanisms, and fiscal tools.
But this struggle to find common ground may prove useful for the wider EU, as its leaders attempt to strike a balance between the responsibility of member governments and the eurozone-wide institutions that the monetary union needs to function effectively.
It may turn out to be easier for Germany’s coalition parties – not to mention the French and German governments – to forge a new framework for bilateral and European security cooperation.
Polls show that concerns about terrorism and internal security outweigh fears over immigration.
If those pressing issues are addressed at the European level, as Merkel suggested in her victory statement, support for Europe could end up winning back the discontented voters who cast their ballots for the AfD.
Whatever government emerges in Germany in the weeks ahead, its leaders will need to devote more effort to explaining their policy choices to citizens and international partners alike.
With the AfD in the Bundestag, the German public will be exposed to more radical positions on foreign affairs – from EU leadership to relations with Russia – than have been heard in over a generation.
While Germany’s center has held, its consensus is about to be tested.
The Populist Tail Wagging the German Dog
WARSAW – Initially, the big losers in Germany’s federal election in September were a Frenchman and a Luxembourger: French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
Each has his own plan for reforming the European Union, and both envision deeper integration, starting with the eurozone.
For his part, Juncker has called on all non-euro member states to adopt the single currency, and has even proposed a roadmap for them to do so.
Macron, meanwhile, has called for a more deeply integrated eurozone with a common budget, which would be funded, in part, by an EU-wide financial transactions tax (currently only France and the United Kingdom levy an FTT).
He has also called for the appointment of a eurozone finance minister, and for measures to harmonize corporate taxes and minimum wages across member states.
Both Juncker and Macron’s plans would require German cooperation.
Germany, however, has little enthusiasm for EU-level economic reforms, because it benefits from the status quo.
A common monetary policy in the absence of a common fiscal policy creates an imbalance that works decidedly in Germany’s favor.
Because Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy, shares a currency with poorer member states, it enjoys an artificial boost to export competitiveness.
Moreover, while Germany is the world’s second-largest exporter (after China), it does not buy much with its surpluses, which means that other EU countries, particularly in the poorer south, cannot earn.
The result is a crisis-generating arrangement that has so far been impossible to correct, even with social transfers and other instruments to rebalance economic development across the eurozone.
Germany has essentially dropped an anchor that is now preventing all of Europe from moving forward.
And that would be the case even if German Chancellor Angela Merkel had managed to forge a coalition between her Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU), the Free Democrats (FDP), and the Greens.
After all, the FDP is essentially the political arm of German business.
Of course, things might be different if the Social Democrats (SPD) agree to rejoin the CDU and CSU in a grand coalition government.
But just how different remains unclear.
Having received its smallest share of the popular vote since World War II, the SPD is severely weakened, and may be unable to pursue anything but the least controversial items on its domestic agenda.
Hans Kundnani of the German Marshall Fund surmises that by voting for the Euroskeptic FDP and the far-right Alternative für Deutchland (AfD), rather than the CDU and SPD, German voters have already expressed their views on Macron’s plan to reform the eurozone.
If he is right, the SPD would be committing political suicide if it supported EU-level reforms.
Then again, all of the ongoing debates about EU reform could prove to be irrelevant, given that the power to decide the bloc’s fate may lie not in Western Europe, but in the East.
While Merkel weighs Macron’s proposals, she is undoubtedly thinking of Germany’s primary economic partner: the Visegrád Group (V4), comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia.
The numbers speak for themselves.
According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,the combined volume of trade between Germany and the V4 in 2016 was €256 billion ($303 billion), far outweighing China (€170 billion) and France (€167 billion).
The Czech and Slovak economies are often regarded as extensions of the German economy; and Germany is an equally crucial partner for Hungary and Poland.
Moreover, Germany’s trade with the V4 is growing fast, with a year-on-year increase of 9% in 2016, while its trade with France, traditionally its largest trading partner, grew at a sluggish 0.6% that year.
But while Germany has managed to assert its economic dominance across the region, it has also become more dependent on its increasingly populist eastern neighbors.
German businesses cannot simply replace their current trading partners on a whim.
And besides, no other region has the same ideal combination of low-cost labor, a well-educated workforce, high rates of economic growth, geographic proximity, and even political stability.
That’s right: while almost every other European country (including Germany) is struggling to form a government, or has settled for an unstable ruling coalition, the provincial strongmenin Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary can guarantee stability.
Whatever one thinks of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his brand of “illiberal democracy,” there is no denying that he has created a secure environment for German business interests.
The same cannot be said for Russia – whose volume of trade with Germany is only around the same as that of Hungary.
While Germany justifies its populist appeasement economically, other countries have also started to recognize the V4’s appeal.
Just this week, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that the Chinese Development Bank will invest an additional €2 billion in Central and Eastern Europe.
China is positioning itself as an economic and technological rival to the EU and the United States.
And, because China itself is ceasing to be a source of cheap labor, it is looking for potential subcontractors – like the V4.
The title of the Bulgarian public intellectual Ivan Krastev’s new book says it all.
In English, it is After Europe; in French, it is Le destin de l’Europe (Europe’s Destiny); and in Germany, it is Europadämmerung (The Twilight of Europe).
The German edition is already a bestseller.
Germany Will Lose if Macron Fails
FRANKFURT – When Emmanuel Macron won the French presidential election, many Germans breathed a loud sigh of relief. A pro-European centrist had soundly defeated a far-right populist, the National Front’s Marine Le Pen.
But if the nationalist threat to Europe is truly to be contained, Germany will have to work with Macron to address the economic challenges that have driven so many voters to reject the European Union.
This will not be easy.
In fact, within a couple of days of the election, core planks of Macron’s economic platform were already under attack in Germany.
For starters, his proposed reforms of eurozone governance have been met with substantial criticism.
Macron’s campaign manifesto embraced the idea of more eurozone federalism, characterized by a shared budget for eurozone public goods, administered by a eurozone economics and finance minister and accountable to a eurozone parliament.
It also called for greater coordination of tax regimes and border controls, stronger protection of the integrity of the internal market, and, in view of the rising threat of protectionism in the United States, a “made in Europe” procurement policy.
An attempt at re-opening the debate about Eurobonds, or the partial mutualization of eurozone public-sector liabilities, was viewed as a pie-in-the-sky suggestion, mostly just a distraction. And, incidentally, it appears nowhere in Macron’s platform.
Far more disturbing to German pundits and policymakers is Macron’s desire for Germany to make use of its fiscal capacity to boost domestic demand, thereby reducing its massive current-account surplus.
These are not new ideas: the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, Macron’s predecessors, and economists throughout Europe have advanced them often.
And, just as predictably, Germany’s government has roundly rejected them, relying on reasoning that, like its counter-arguments, is well rehearsed.
For the most part, German economists and officials believe that economic policy should focus almost exclusively on the supply side, diagnosing and addressing structural problems.
And German officials also regularly suggest that their economy is already performing at close to its supply-determined limits.
In fact, far from viewing the current-account surplus as a policy problem, the German government sees it as a reflection of the underlying competitiveness of German firms.
It is the benign upshot of responsible labor unions, which allow for appropriate firm-level wage flexibility.
The accumulation of foreign assets is a logical corollary of these surpluses, not to mention an imperative for an aging society.
Indeed, German policymakers view as essential a reduction of Germany’s debt-to-GDP ratio toward the 60% ceiling set by European rules.
When, if not in good times, does one have the chance to save?
This stance does not align particularly smoothly with Macron’s economic program.
While Macron’s program includes significant proposals for addressing supply-side issues with the French economy, it also favors output stabilization and, more important, increased spending in areas like public infrastructure, digitization, and clean energy to boost potential growth.
Despite Macron’s decisive victory, he faces an uphill battle implementing his economic agenda.
Even if the National Assembly, to be elected in June, endorses his reform program, street-level resistance will be no less fierce than it has been over the last few years.
Germany, however, has good reason to support Macron’s supply- and demand-side reforms.
After all, France and Germany are deeply interdependent, meaning that Germany has a stake in Macron’s fate.
While it is true that the German government cannot (fortunately) fine-tune wages, it could, out of sheer self-interest, provide for its future by investing more in its human and social capital – including schools, from kindergartens to universities, and infrastructure like roads, bridges, and bandwidth.
This approach would reduce the private user cost of capital, thereby making private investment more attractive. It would also create domestic real assets, reducing Germany’s exposure to foreign credit risk.
A lower current-account surplus implies a more sustainable net-financial-liability position for Germany’s partners.
If Germany and Macron don’t find common ground, the costs to both will be massive.
No malicious external actor is imposing populism on Europe; it has emerged organically, fueled by real and widespread grievances.
While those grievances are not exclusively economic, the geography of populism does fit that of the EU’s economic malaise: too many Europeans have been losing out for too long.
So, if Macron fails to deliver on his promises, a Euroskeptic like Le Pen could well win France’s next election.
To avoid this outcome, Macron must be firmer than his predecessors in pursuing difficult but ultimately beneficial policies. He might take a page from former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder’s playbook.
In 2003, Schröder prioritized reforms over rigorous obedience to the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact.
Additional fiscal leeway was needed to smooth the economy’s adjustment to the bold labor-market reforms that he was introducing. The decision to prioritize reforms over obstinate rule-following proved to be a good one.
Now is Macron’s Schröderian moment. He, too, appears to have opted for reasoned pragmatism over the blind implementation of rigid rules (which cannot make sense under any circumstances).
Fortunately, policy principles are not written in stone, not even in Germany.
Recall that the German government adamantly rejected the eurozone banking union and the European Stability Mechanism, both of which were ultimately launched (though some say it was too little, too late).
Europe is experiencing a seismic shift, with its political system being undermined from within (and becoming vulnerable to Russian pressure from without).
Fear of the “other” and perceptions of trade as a zero-sum game are taking hold.
These circumstances call for bold and committed action, not only by France, but also by Germany, which, ultimately, has the most to lose.
Europe’s Franco-German Dream Team
PARIS – When the International Monetary Fund lowered its global growth forecast for 2014 and 2015 from 3.7% and 3.9%, respectively, to 3.3% and 3.8%, it cited the eurozone’s increasingly gloomy prospects, including significantly slower growth in Germany, as a leading cause.
After all, the eurozone still accounts for about 13% of world output at market prices – about the same as China.
Europe’s economic struggles are reflected in its political situation, with many European electorates now mired in a sense of hopelessness and sliding toward ideological extremes.
But a forthcoming report by two highly respected economists – Jean Pisani-Ferry, the French government’s Commissioner-General for Policy Planning, and Henrik Enderlein, a key leader of a reformist group of German economists – will propose a way forward.
The task facing Pisani-Ferry and Enderlein is to create a new reform strategy for Europe’s two largest economies, focusing on structural reforms in France and increased investment in Germany.
The hope is that the report, which will be made public on December 1, will provide a breakthrough that can revive, at long last, the eurozone’s growth engine.
The paper was commissioned a few days after the IMF’s Annual Meetings last month, at a gathering of the French finance and economy ministers, Michel Sapin and Emmanuel Macron, and their German counterparts, Wolfgang Schäuble and Sigmar Gabriel.
Though the meeting produced no concrete policy action – as the French daily Le Monde put it, “nothing was asked for, and nothing was obtained” – it could signal the beginning of more effective Franco-German cooperation, guided by the Pisani-Ferry/Enderlein report.
Such cooperation could not come at a better time.
A couple of weeks after the project was initiated, France and Italy submitted revised annual budgets to the European Commission, in which they demanded more fiscal room for maneuver.
The Commission now has until the end of this month to determine whether France has pursued reform diligently enough to avoid penalties for breaking its pledge to cut its budget deficit to less than 3% of GDP by next year.
An effective reform strategy would have to balance the need for budget restraint and macroeconomic stability with growth-enhancing policies.
When it comes to the latter, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s proposals in August – expanded monetary easing, structural reforms (particularly in France and Italy), and some fiscal expansion by countries like Germany – provide a useful framework to be supplemented with concrete measures.
The ECB governing council has already agreed, in principle, to use the first of these policy tools.
But monetary expansion alone will be inadequate to lift the eurozone out of stagnation.
Moreover, many of the structural reforms that are currently being considered or implemented, despite boosting growth in the long term, can have short-term contractionary effects.
This is particularly true of greater labor-market flexibility, a key asset for long-term growth that can lead to a short-term increase in unemployment.
That is why a more expansionary fiscal stance is also vital, with Germany leading the way in deploying increased public investment to “crowd in” private investment and boost competitiveness.
The IMF’s recent World Economic Outlook describes the success of this approach in recessionary environments.
Given that Germany and even France can borrow at record-low interest rates, any reasonably well-designed investment program will strengthen the public sector’s balance sheet.
And, with the eurozone running a current-account surplus of nearly $350 billion – which the euro’s recent decline will bolster further – there is no risk of a eurozone-wide balance-of-payments crisis.
The key is confidence.
Germany must trust that its agreement to loosen the eurozone’s fiscal belt will not lead to a slowdown of structural reforms, and countries like France need to know that excessive austerity will not exacerbate the impact of politically difficult structural reforms in the short run.
In this sense, top-level political support, voiced in a way that elicits the approval of Europe’s citizens, will be crucial.
Gabriel and Macron must lead the charge, backed by Sapin and Schäuble.
Crucially, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French Prime Minister Manuel Valls – not to mention the new Commission – must also step in to offer genuine support for the project.
Waning confidence is a eurozone-wide problem, but the Franco-German relationship lies at its core.
And, as experience has shown, Germany and France can have a major impact when they work together.
The power of that relationship is what the Pisani-Ferry/Enderlein initiative represents – and what could, with sufficient political support, revitalize Europe.
Germany, the G20, and Inclusive Globalization
BERLIN – Globalization is getting increasingly bad press in the West nowadays.
Populist movements allege that it does not benefit the average citizen very much, if at all.
Instead, they tout protectionism and unilateralism.
National policies, whether with respect to trade or financial regulation, are seen as the surest way to restore national greatness.
But this populist agenda is based on the deeply flawed premise that international cooperation and international trade are zero-sum games, producing only winners and losers.
In fact, cooperation and trade can deliver benefits to all countries.
For many years now, they have increased global security and certainly global prosperity, with hundreds of millions of people lifted out of poverty, both in the developed and the developing world.
To be sure, globalization needs rules and a recognized framework to ensure that it benefits everybody, delivering sustained and inclusive economic growth.
As with national legislation, it is a framework that requires constant adjustments.
But to abandon it altogether and retreat from globalization is the wrong answer.
On the contrary, we should be seeking ways to deepen and broaden international economic cooperation.
In my view, the G20 is the best forum for increased and inclusive cooperation.
Of course, the G20 is not perfect, but it is the best institution we now have for achieving a form of globalization that works for everyone.
Through it, the world’s main industrialized and emerging countries have worked together toward constructing a shared global order that can deliver increasing prosperity.
Indeed, the G20 is the political backbone of the global financial architecture that secures open markets, orderly capital flows, and a safety net for countries in difficulty.
The G20 has achieved much in recent years, including better coordination on financial regulation and international taxation.
And, as the country that holds the G20 presidency this year, Germany is committed to continuing the important work begun under our most recent predecessors in China and Turkey.
For example, more needs to be done to strengthen the global economy’s resilience against sudden shocks.
So one of the G20’s top priorities this year will be our work to prevent a recurrence of a global financial and economic crisis like that of 2008-2009, which stemmed from a myopic, debt-based growth model.
But, in order to tackle the gulf between the richest and the poorest countries, we need to go beyond the G20.
In particular, the G20 – indeed the entire world – must reach out to Africa at this critical moment in the continent’s development.
Beyond the moral question of raising Africans’ living standards, the continent’s development is crucial to reducing geopolitical risks.
But investment in Africa is still low, depriving people in African countries of opportunities to improve their lives.
For these reasons, the G20 during the German presidency is working to intensify its partnership with Africa.
A central pillar of this effort is the “Compact with Africa,” which provides a framework for supporting private investment, including in infrastructure.
We propose that, with the G20’s political backing, African governments, international organizations, and bilateral partners prepare comprehensive, country-specific investment compacts to encourage private-sector investment.
Each country is to implement a bespoke package of measures to decrease its investment risks.
Essentially, the Compact with Africa is a contribution to implementing the African Union’s Agenda 2063 blueprint for economic development.
That AU agenda provides guidance for improving macroeconomic, business, and financial frameworks across the continent.
While the Compact with Africa is open to all African countries, five have already committed to pioneering this new approach: the finance ministers of Côte d’Ivoire, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, and Tunisia want to work on compacts and have expressed this in writing.
I have invited them to attend the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting on March 17-18 in Baden-Baden.
At that meeting, my G20 peers and I will offer these countries an international platform to present their plans.
We want to discuss with them, and the heads of the African Development Bank, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, what the elements of country-specific investment compacts could be.
Afterwards, these five countries, together with international organizations and bilateral partners, will select the specific measures and instruments to be included in each individual investment compact.
The G20 will provide high political visibility, helping to raise investors’ awareness of these changes.
I am confident that significant progress can be achieved when all partners involved work together closely and on an equal footing.
International cooperation is the only way to achieve strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive global growth.
Germany is committed to do its best as an honest broker within the G20 and beyond to ensure that globalization truly does benefit all.
Is Germany Catching Trump’s Tax Disease?
BERLIN – After months of negotiations, another grand coalition government – comprising Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and a grudging Social Democratic Party (SPD) – is taking shape in Germany.
But the new government seems likely to miss the opportunity afforded by Germany’s strong economic and financial situation to pursue much-needed reforms.
In fact, the fiscal policies that Germany’s emerging government is discussing bear a remarkable resemblance to those of US President Donald Trump, whose tax plan, most economists agree, will bring limited short-term benefits to a few, but huge long-term costs to many more.
Indeed, the incipient German government is discussing cutting taxes for corporations and the rich, while raising spending on public consumption, especially public pensions.
In the United States, Trump has convinced many of his lower-income supporters that his tax plan will benefit them, not just his wealthy cohorts.
A similar feat has been accomplished in Germany, with some powerful lobby groups persuading middle-class voters that they will benefit from a tax cut.
These groups claim, for example, that raising the income threshold for the top marginal tax rate will help middle-income voters, even though the top marginal tax rate is now levied on just 7% of German employees.
Similarly, the plan to abolish the tax surcharge on higher incomes (Solidaritätszuschlag), introduced after reunification in the early 1990s, would benefit almost exclusively the top 30% of earners.
This is all the more problematic because the top 30% of earners in Germany are already subject to a lower tax rate than 20 years ago, even though their wealth has increased.
The bottom 70% largely pay much more in direct and indirect taxes, despite often having lower incomes.
The arguments for cutting corporate taxes are similarly flawed.
Like Trump, German politicians and lobby groups claim that domestic firms need a tax cut in order to stay competitive internationally.
Yet Germany’s export companies are undeniably very competitive, and have largely managed to increase their global market share since the 1990s.
Moreover, corporate profits have reached record highs in recent years, and while corporate taxes in Germany remain relatively high compared to other countries, they were reduced significantly in the 2000s.
Beyond having only limited economic benefits, the proposed tax cuts in Germany – like Trump’s in the US – represent a huge strain on public finances in the long run.
While Germany’s public sector currently boasts a surplus of about 1.3% of GDP, that is largely the result of good luck, not good policy: without low interest rates and a strong labor market, the federal budget would be in deficit.
Yet demographic shifts mean that contingent liabilities for public pensions and health care in Germany will rise sharply over the next decades.
Covering these costs will require taxes to be increased substantially and/or for spending to be reduced – precisely the opposite of what the CDU/SPD government is promising.
This does not mean that Germany’s government should not contemplate any tax reductions or spending increases.
But, in order to ensure that such changes have the maximum positive impact, without hurting younger generations, they must be designed fundamentally differently.
Arguably, Germany’s biggest economic weakness today is low private investment.
With the German corporate sector having run up massive profits for more than a decade, the resources are certainly available.
Yet overregulation, heavy bureaucratic burdens, policy uncertainty, poor digital and transport infrastructure, and, in some industries, a lack of skilled workers, are currently impeding investment by companies in new and existing capacity.
The government need not address all obstacles to investment and innovation at once.
At the very least, it should create tax incentives for research and development, as well as for equity investments.
It should also design provisions to support small and medium-size enterprises, while fighting tax evasion among big firms.
Moreover, Germany’s government should use its fiscal space to invest in education, in particular in pre-schools and primary schools.
And it should invest in developing an internationally competitive digital infrastructure and a social security system that ensures labor-force participation and lowers long-term unemployment.
In many ways, Germany’s economy is thriving.
But that is no reason for the government to waste its sizable fiscal surplus on economically useless tax cuts and spending increases.
On the contrary, the surplus creates an important opportunity to tackle the long-run challenges that Germany faces – an opportunity that Merkel’s next government must not waste.
Germany’s Coming Silver Age
MUNICH – Record levels of migration to Germany over the last two years have called into question the country’s demographic projections.
But Germany’s rapid shift to a more favorable profile is not a reason to postpone politically painful policy decisions about retirement and pensions.
At the beginning of this century, forecasts that were considered reliable predicted that Germany would lose more than ten million inhabitants by 2050, owing to declining immigration and a low average birth rate.
Today, population projections are significantly brighter.
According to the government’s latest calculations, Germany’s population could remain above 80 million until 2060, and the reduction in the labor supply might not be as drastic as was previously feared.
Demographic forecasts needed to be corrected significantly, because the number of immigrants to Germany has fluctuated wildly and unpredictably, as opposed to emigration from Germany, which has remained relatively stable.
During high-immigration periods – such as in the early 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, or in the wake of the mid-1990s Balkan wars – population projections were fairly optimistic, because it was assumed that net migration would remain relatively high in the future as well.
Instead, immigration to Germany fell drastically after the turn of the century, because the country’s weak economic growth and rising unemployment until 2005 deterred would-be newcomers.
To account for this reduction in net immigration, forecasters also lowered their estimates for the future, and thus underestimated the decade of population growth that began after 2005.
Alongside immigration, birth rates and average life expectancy also factor into population growth.
In 2015, the fertility rate in Germany rose for the first time in 30 years, to 1.5 children per woman – probably owing to more focused family support and a strengthening economy, which reduced the financial risks of starting a family.
The current fertility rate is expected to remain relatively stable into the future.
But it is worth remembering that nobody foresaw the baby boom of the 1950s and 1960s or the dramatic fertility-rate decline in the 1970s.
Average life expectancy is similarly hard to pin down.
In recent decades, it has consistently risen faster than demographers expected, which makes one wonder if longevity – and thus the size of the future retirement-age population – is being systematically underestimated.
As a rule, population forecasts start with static or period life tables that capture average life expectancy under the existing circumstances at any given time.
But generation life tables, which are used to determine retrospectively how old a given age group has become, usually show a much higher average life expectancy than period life tables.
For example, German women born in 1910 would have had a life expectancy of 50.7 years at that time.
But, looking back, they ended up living 58.8 years on average, even as they endured two world wars.
By this logic, a woman born in 2009 should have already had an average life expectancy of more than 88 years; but current population estimates do not foresee that average life expectancy for newborns until 2060.
This shows that population estimates have relatively high margins of error.
Contrary to what is assumed in many economic-growth models, demography is not a purely exogenous variable.
Rather, it is susceptible to change as a result of economic development and other factors.
If Germany sustains its current level of economic growth in the coming decades, all three drivers of population growth – immigration, fertility, and average life expectancy – could rise, and the population would remain relatively constant.
In this scenario, if Germany can integrate immigrants into the labor market and increase older workers’ labor-participation rate, it would be in a better position to finance existing social-welfare programs.
But we must not forget the one “constant” in all demographic forecasts: the aging of the population.
Right now, baby boomers are still economically active, and will remain so for some time.
But, by 2035, they will have retired, and Germany will have more than 21 million inhabitants over the age of 67; half of them will be over 80 by 2050.
And if longevity rises faster than is currently expected, this age group will be even larger.
Germany cannot expect to see a sustained, moderate shrinking of its retirement-age population until after 2060.
Thus, proposals to water down previously implemented pension reforms, in light of rising immigration and healthy economic growth, are more than negligent.
Germany should be using the current aging pause to ensure its social systems’ long-term sustainability, create age-appropriate jobs, and adapt housing and infrastructure to the needs of an aging society.
In addition, Germany should have an active population policy to manage the three drivers of population growth, especially immigration.
In the past two years, net migration was heavily influenced by the influx of asylum-seekers.
The number of people who will need protection in the coming years or decades remains to be seen, and will depend on whether crises in the Middle East can be resolved, and on European and Germany’s own efforts to secure external borders and craft a comprehensive asylum policy.
Given these variables, the degree to which migration is affected by asylum-seekers will not be easy to predict or control.
By contrast, economically motivated immigration from countries outside of the European Union can be managed at the national level.
So, German policymakers should be giving more consideration to the role of domestic requirements in immigration law.
Now more than ever, they need to recognize that population growth is a policy objective that they can help to shape.
Lessons from Germany for Integrating Refugees
DAVOS – Governments around the world are facing a huge challenge.
The number of international migrants has surged in recent years, reaching 244 million in 2015 – a 41% increase from 2000.
With that total including 20 million refugees, preventing a humanitarian nightmare demands swift and responsible integration into host societies.
The logistical challenge of doing so is placing mounting pressure on the countries facing the largest influxes.
Germany, which received about 1.1 million people in 2015, knows this pressure all too well.
Yet Germany has not buckled.
On the contrary, it has handled the pressure exceedingly well, proving that through sustained collaboration among governments, business, and civil society, countries can develop effective approaches to meeting the needs of refugees and the countries that receive them.
To succeed, each country must ensure that it has the capabilities, resources, and structures in place to manage refugees’ needs efficiently.
Sound management and coordination among transit and destination countries can enable governments, businesses, NGOs, and aid agencies to address more effectively the challenges that will inevitably arise along the way.
At the same time, to ensure that actors in transit and host countries actually provide what the refugees need, the challenges that arise must be viewed from the refugees’ perspective.
Fortunately, the needed cooperation and commitment seems to be emerging.
From my own vantage point in Germany, I’ve seen growing numbers of businesses seize the opportunity to tackle logistical and humanitarian challenges, offering services that help refugees rebuild their lives, while sharing the costs of infrastructure, technology, health care, training, education, and more.
In particular, about 100 German businesses, including some that are household names, have joined the Wir Zusammen (We Together) initiative, which aims to help integrate new arrivals.
To date, the initiative has secured internships for some 1,800 refugees and apprenticeships for another 300.
My own firm, PwC Germany, offers a free ten-week language and vocational training course for refugees when they first arrive – the most critical period for them.
Many refugees are prohibited from working during their first three months in a new host country, and lack access to public integration programs until their asylum application is approved.
Thanks to our initiative and others like it, refugees can use this time to prepare to enter the job market, by gaining valuable skills, not to mention a certified assessment of their occupational aptitude.
Such initiatives help not just the refugees, but also businesses – and, in turn, Germany’s economy.
Companies that are not afraid of language barriers and cultural differences early in the integration process are rewarded with the chance to train and hire people who are highly motivated and often highly skilled.
For companies facing skills shortages, this should be particularly tempting.
Manufacturing, health care, and nursing are likely to benefit the most from the growth in the labor pool.
Germany’s experience holds important lessons for other countries attempting to resettle refugees.
One of the most useful and readily applicable is that the refugee journey is best managed in four distinct phases.
The transit phase.
The refugee has escaped from a country where life has become unsustainable, whether because of conflict or a lack of economic opportunities, but has yet to arrive in the host country.
This is the most insecure phase, during which refugees have no safe haven.
They are vulnerable not only to the elements, but also to smugglers, traffickers, and other criminals seeking to take advantage of their vulnerability.
The arrival phase.
Refugees find some semblance of safety, as they are given temporary shelter and support.
During this phase, they can register with their current host country and apply for asylum in the protective country of their choice.
Protection, settlement, and integration.
Once in their country of choice, refugees receive protection and support, while they await the assessment of their asylum applications.
If accepted, they are provided with housing and integrated into communities through work and education programs.
It is during this stage that businesses can make the biggest contribution.
Indeed, I strongly believe that integration works best when linked to practical training and concrete professional opportunities.
The repatriation phase.
If a refugee’s application for asylum is refused, he or she is returned to the country of origin.
In the longer term, repatriation can occur even with refugees who secure asylum, if the circumstances in their home country change and it becomes safe to return.
In every phase, many parallel tasks require capabilities and resourcing.
As we have seen in Germany, business can play a major role in supporting national and local governments, thereby helping the refugees, themselves, and the wider economy.
In that sense, the refugee crisis really is a valuable opportunity.
For refugees’ sake – and our own – we should not squander it.
Will Europe Let Germany Lead?
BERLIN – The United Kingdom’s Brexit vote, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s referendum defeat and subsequent resignation, and Donald Trump’s election as President of the United States have created a power vacuum in the West, and in Europe.
At a time when Europe needs to make important collective economic and foreign-policy decisions, domestic issues are preoccupying larger European Union member states such as France, the UK, Spain, and Italy.
Consequently, there is growing pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her government to step up and lead.
But while Germany wants to show leadership, it needs European partners who are willing to engage and compromise.
Germany’s critics are right to say that it could be more open to other member states’ policy proposals, but many of the complaints leveled against Germany have been unfair – and often self-serving.
For example, the German government has been accused of shunning European solidarity in response to the 2008 financial crisis.
But, while German measures have sometimes come too late, or been ill-conceived – such as its “temporary Grexit” proposal – Germany’s government has also agreed to numerous bailout programs, the creation of the European Stability Mechanism, and an EU banking union.
What’s more, Germany has borne the largest financial burden.
Germany has also been criticized for not agreeing to underwrite Eurobonds, and for opposing a transfer union.
But these arguments have not always been made in good faith: member states such as France want to share risk without ceding sufficient sovereignty over economic policymaking.
Germany’s government and citizens are more open than most to the deeper integration required to make the euro sustainable, including fiscal union.
But, to achieve that, all partners need to move forward, in terms of sharing policy sovereignty and risk.
A third complaint made against Germany is that it engages in beggar-thy-neighbor behavior, by pursuing restrictive fiscal policies that have created an excessive current-account surplus of close to 9% of GDP.
This has indeed been a mistake.
But it is Germany’s problem, first and foremost.
While Germany has a large investment gap that hurts domestic productivity and growth, it is not the main culprit behind tepid growth, high unemployment, low competitiveness, and other economic ills elsewhere in Europe.
Admittedly, many German policymakers have been misguided in their obsession with fiscal austerity, and with their criticism of the European Central Bank’s monetary-policy approach.
But they are justifiably frustrated with the slow pace of economic reform across the EU.
Overall, Germans are deeply pro-European, and the German government has done more for Europe than it is given credit for.
Leadership mistakes are easy to identify and criticize in retrospect.
A more constructive exercise is to judge decisions in the context of the information that was available at the time they were made, and to apply past lessons to future choices.
With the benefit of hindsight, the German government – indeed, any government – would have acted differently with respect to the Greek debt crisis, fiscal policy, the Brexit referendum, and so forth.
So, a fairer benchmark for German leadership is other large European governments’ own track records.
Would Europe really be better off today if Germany’s government had followed the paths taken by its French, British, or Italian counterparts in recent years?
Even if Merkel was late in responding to the crises in Italy and Greece, she has also shown extraordinary tolerance, open-mindedness, and foresight.
In two key areas – addressing the refugee crisis and confronting Russian aggression – her government has shown more European solidarity than most other member states.
Moreover, Merkel demonstrated sound leadership in her response to Trump’s victory.
She congratulated him, and offered him a close working relationship, but only on the basis of “common values” such as “democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person.”
She is also the most important, and the most sympathetic, partner for the UK government in the upcoming Brexit negotiations.
Merkel’s approval rating remains the envy of other European leaders, and she could be the last well-grounded, non-populist head of government among the larger Western countries.
Italy’s December 4 constitutional-reform referendum may have been the final wake-up call for Europe to get its act together in order to address social divisions, political extremism, and deepening economic and political crises.
The German government should learn from its past mistakes, while continuing to step up as a leader for Europe.
But it can’t do it alone.
Other EU governments should stop bashing Germany as a way to deflect attention from their own failings.
In recent years, their attacks have gone too far, and have been counterproductive.
Germany needs its partners to come to the table, and to engage in a constructive dialogue about concrete solutions to Europe’s deepening crisis.
Germany’s Götterdämmerung
MUNICH – Germany is experiencing a political watershed.
It is not just that the exit of the Free Democrats (FDP) from coalition talks has cast doubt on whether Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) will remain in power.
The FDP’s departure from negotiations with the CDU, its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Greens marks the end of a willingness to forge stable coalition governments that has defined German politics since the last days of Konrad Adenauer’s postwar chancellorship.
Of course, without the FDP’s participation, Merkel could pursue a coalition government with the Social Democrats (SPD).
But the decimated SPD says that it is determined to remain in opposition, in order to recover from its crushing defeat at the polls.
Any other possible coalition is out of the question, because neither the far left nor the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) are seen as acceptable partners.
A minority government under Merkel, however, is conceivable.
Given that President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has expressed his distaste for calling a new election, such a scenario could become likely if Merkel does not resign on her own.
And even if there is a new election, the outcome would not be much different, unless SPD leader Martin Schulz steps down.
A minority government might be formed by the CDU and the CSU without the formal participation of other parties.
A minority coalition that included the Greens would force the CSU to compromise on migration issues and climate policy, which would be unnecessary otherwise, given the inability of the SPD, Die Linke (The Left), and the Greens to block legislation.
And Merkel herself will try to avoid a minority coalition with the FDP, in order to avoid becoming dependent on it.
The FDP, for its part, would like to participate in such a government for exactly that reason.
It would then be able to contain Merkel’s red-green affinity.
A minority government, whatever its composition, would not necessarily be a bad thing.
With the government seeking partners to enact legislation on an ad hoc basis, the Bundestag would finally become the site of genuine public debate once again.
For too long, coalition partners have negotiated government decisions behind closed doors, with the Bundestag either rubber-stamping or vetoing the results.
Those who stand to gain the most from such a strengthening of parliament will be the small parties that otherwise have little chance of asserting their influence.
Above all, the AfD, Germany’s version of the French National Front, which emerged from nothing as Germany’s third-largest party in the September election, will benefit from open debate.
So far, the media have largely focused on discrediting the party.
But a more proactive Bundestag would inevitably become a showcase for the AfD’s arguments and rhetoric.
At the same time, a minority federal government’s foreign policy would undoubtedly be weakened, and Merkel would find it difficult to play an active part in European politics.
This would also mean, however, that Germany’s European partners would struggle to force compromise upon the German government.
This dynamic will be particularly important for France, given President Emmanuel Macron’s goal of consolidating the eurozone by providing it with more attributes of statehood, and his desire to push ahead with a two-speed Europe comprising a eurozone and a large non-euro fringe consisting of northern and eastern EU countries.
A German minority government would have to hold lengthy debates with all of the Bundestag’s parliamentary groups on every major decision before it could assent to Macron’s proposals – or any other, for that matter.
Effective opposition at home means that the government would no longer be able to acquiesce in the dead of night to various rescue operations for Germany’s EU partners.
That’s what happened in May 2010, when Merkel’s government was forced by the French triumvirate of European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to violate the Maastricht Treaty by establishing a rescue fund for Greece’s foreign creditors, primarily French banks.
Germany was also forced to compromise in 2012, when Merkel was pushed into agreeing to a banking union and the ECB’s “outright monetary transactions” program, which effectively turned European government bonds into Eurobonds.
Likewise, kneejerk decisions by Merkel – such as her move to phase out nuclear power within a few months of the Fukushima accident in Japan, or to allow refugees to enter Germany from safe third countries – will now be impossible.
That is welcome, because too often politicians, driven by the momentum of their own thoughts, make decisions that have serious adverse consequences in the long term.
With the nuclear phase-out, for example, Germany can now honor its commitments to combat climate change only by damaging, and perhaps losing, part of its industrial base.
By admitting 1.5 million migrants in just two years, Germany has also placed a massive burden on its welfare state, inadvertently encouraged the Brexiteers, and rallied all of Eastern Europe against it.
It is too early to tell how the political uncertainty now confronting Germany and Europe will be resolved.
But a Merkel who can be called to account by the Bundestag may be the best alternative Germany has.
While Germany Slept
BERLIN – Few people outside Germany are familiar with the caricature of themselves that many Germans hold in their minds.
Far from the aggressive bully of twentieth-century war propaganda, the perfectionist engineer of Madison Avenue car advertisements, or the rule-following know-it-all of the silver screen, the German many picture today is a sleepy-headed character clad in nightgown and cap.
Sometimes clutching a candle, this German cuts a naïve, forlorn figure, bewildered by the surrounding world.
This figure is not new.
On the contrary, referred to as “Der deutsche Michel” or “the German Michel,” it was popularized in the nineteenth century as a character whose limited perspective causes him to shun great ideas, eschew change, and aspire only to a decent, quiet, and comfortable life.
But Michel has now made a comeback.
And who can blame him?
Germany now boasts a booming economy, near full employment, rising wages, and content unions.
The financial crisis is long forgotten, public budgets are under control; and the 2015 influx of migrants has been relatively well managed.
What bad news there is – industrial scandals (like that at Volkswagen), airline bankruptcies, endlessly delayed infrastructure projects – does little to dampen the general sense of safety and wellbeing enjoyed by Germany’s Michels.
The only real threat, it seems, is the world outside Germany’s borders.
In this sense, last autumn’s election campaign was perfectly suited to Germany’s Michels.
“A land where we live well and happily,” the campaign slogan of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), resonated with them, as did the rather provincial and mostly empty messages of rival parties.
With the exception of the right-wing populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), the parties displayed a rote civility and drowsy acceptance of consensus that pacified the electorate.
After the election, the real politicking began, but even then, pains were taken to obscure those activities from Germany’s Michels.
Indeed, though party officials had been in place for some time, they waited until the votes were cast before putting their cards on the table, and even then did so behind closed doors.
Even the leaks from these closed-door coalition talks were so well managed that they created the illusion that the “Sondierungsgespräche” – that is, the preparatory talks among party officials – were politically rather harmless.
But Germany’s political class, like its ordinary Michels, are in denial.
The soporific federal elections, the breakdown of coalition talks among the CDU, its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Greens, and the Free Democrats (FDP), and the timid dance between the CDU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) since then all point to a serious deficit in German politics.
The truth is that the various party platforms, meant to inform the electorate and provide a basis for coalition talks, reveal a shocking lack of imagination and paucity of new ideas.
Second-order issues are presented as red lines, with largely technical questions – for example, about refugee family reunions, a new health insurance scheme no one asked for (Bürgerversicherung), or the role of the federal government in funding education – taking center stage.
Considering the state of Europe and the world – and the hopes many outsiders are pinning on German leadership – these issues seem rather marginal.
But the real problem is that they are distracting from larger issues relating to, say, the euro, security and defense, migration, infrastructure, and taxation.
Lacking any forward-looking political visions, German politics has degenerated to tactical plays being carried out by established players.
The CDU, in a War of the Roses with the CSU, can live neither with or without Merkel, while the SPD is unsure of itself and fears further political decline.
None of this bodes well for a country whose parliament has already been diminished, after these three parties, during their eight years forming a coalition government, marginalized the opposition and failed to build up new leadership cadres.
Coalition agreements in Germany have always been elaborate documents of a quasi-contractual nature.
But there is a growing tendency to plan out four years of governing, with leaders then using legislative periods not to debate laws, but rather to enact previously agreed policies.
Moreover, no major reform has been successfully implemented in Germany since the 2000s, when Chancellor Gerhard Schröder pushed through labor-market reforms.
No forward-looking reforms of the caliber of Schröder’s Agenda 2010 were even attempted under Merkel in over a decade.
The CDU/CSU and the SPD are now pursuing a grand coalition that would keep Germany roughly on the same path it has taken during the last eight years.
The 28-page agreement that will allow formal coalition talks to proceed is overly detailed, technocratic, unambitious, and lacks vision.
It is thus unsurprising that, though CDU/CSU and SPD negotiators have touted the deal as a breakthrough, many, especially in the SPD, are unhappy with the outcome, with some calling for renegotiation.
The SPD now faces a choice: at its special party congress this weekend, its leaders must decide whether to join yet another grand coalition government that promises more of the same, or move into opposition, probably triggering new elections.
But there is another option, which many have ignored: a CDU-led minority government, with Merkel as chancellor.
Freed of stifling coalition agreements with a reluctant SPD or a coldly calculating FDP, Merkel could choose her cabinet based on competence and vision, rather than party politics.
She could even appoint ministers from other parties.
Most important, Merkel could finally tackle the important issues that have fallen by the wayside in recent years, to which the current coalition agreement pays only lip service.
This means cooperating with French President Emmanuel Macron to move the European project forward; modernizing Germany’s public administration system; preparing the labor force for digitization; and tackling immigration issues.
Parliament is integral to success on any of these fronts.
Mainstream parties must embrace the kind of open and constructive debate that nurtured parliamentary democracy in the Federal Republic’s early years, rather than remaining focused on political tactics.
Michel may prefer the modest policy initiatives and incrementalism that have characterized Merkel’s chancellorships.
But a minority government forced to muster coalitions of the willing to address the critical issues confronting Germany and Europe could escape the constraints of Michel’s expectations, freeing German politics from party tacticians and enabling real and much-needed reform.
In other words, the modicum of political insecurity Germany faces today may well be just what the country needs to give rise to new ideas and voices, and a better future.
Germany Must Defend the Euro
NEW YORK – Financial markets abhor uncertainty; that is why they are now in crisis mode.
The governments of the eurozone have taken some significant steps in the right direction to resolve the euro crisis but, obviously, they did not go far enough to reassure the markets.
At their meeting on July 21, the European authorities enacted a set of half-measures.
They established the principle that their new fiscal agency, the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), should be responsible for solvency problems, but they failed to increase the EFSF’s size.
This stopped short of establishing a credible fiscal authority for the eurozone.
And the new mechanism will not be operative until September at the earliest.
In the meantime, liquidity provision by the European Central Bank is the only way to prevent a collapse in the price of bonds issued by several European countries.
Likewise, Eurozone leaders extended the EFSF’s competence to deal with banks’ solvency, but stopped short of transferring banking supervision from national agencies to a European body.
And they offered an extended aid package to Greece without building a convincing case that the rescue can succeed: they arranged for the participation of bondholders in the Greek rescue package, but the arrangement benefited the banks more than Greece.
Perhaps most worryingly, Europe finally recognized the principle – long followed by the IMF – that countries in bailout programs should not be penalized on interest rates, but the same principle was not extended to countries that are not yet in bailout programs.
As a result, Spain and Italy have had to pay much more on their own borrowing than they receive from Greece.
This gives them the right to opt out of the Greek rescue, raising the prospect that the package may unravel.
Financial markets, recognizing this possibility, raised the risk premium on Spanish and Italian bonds to unsustainable levels.
ECB intervention helped, but it did not cure the problem.
The situation is becoming intolerable.
The authorities are trying to buy time, but time is running out.
The crisis is rapidly reaching a climax.
Germany and the other eurozone members with AAA ratings will have to decide whether they are willing to risk their own credit to permit Spain and Italy to refinance their bonds at reasonable interest rates.
Alternatively, Spain and Italy will be driven inexorably into bailout programs.
In short, Germany and the other countries with AAA bond ratings must agree to a eurobond regime of one kind or another.
Otherwise, the euro will break down.
It should be recognized that a disorderly default or exit from the eurozone, even by a small country like Greece, would precipitate a banking crisis comparable to the one that caused the Great Depression. It is no longer a question whether it is worthwhile to have a common currency.
The euro exists, and its collapse would cause incalculable losses to the banking system.
So the choice that Germany faces is more apparent than real – and it is a choice whose cost will rise the longer Germany delays making it.
The euro crisis had its origin in German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision, taken in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers’ default in September 2008, that the guarantee against further defaults should come not from the European Union, but from each country separately.
And it was German procrastination that aggravated the Greek crisis and caused the contagion that turned it into an existential crisis for Europe.
Only Germany can reverse the dynamic of disintegration in Europe.
That will not come easily: Merkel, after all, read the German public’s mood correctly when she made her fateful decision, and the domestic political atmosphere has since become even more inhospitable to extending credit to the rest of Europe.
Merkel can overcome political resistance only in a crisis atmosphere, and only in small steps.
The next step will likely be to enlarge the EFSF; but, by the time that step is taken, France’s AAA rating may be endangered.
Indeed, by the time Germany agrees to a eurobond regime, its own AAA standing may be at risk.
The only way that Europe can escape from this trap is by acting in anticipation of financial markets’ reactions, rather than yielding to their pressure after the fact.
This would require intense debate and soul-searching, particularly in Germany, which, as the EU’s largest and best-rated economy, has been thrust into the position of deciding the future of Europe.
That is a role that Germany has been eager to avoid and remains unwilling to accept.
But Germany has no real choice.
A breakdown of the euro would precipitate a banking crisis that would be beyond the global financial authorities’ ability to control.
The longer Germany takes to recognize this, the higher the price it will have to pay.
Germany’s Economic Road Ahead
MUNICH – The next German government will face economic-policy challenges in five key areas: digitalization and automation, demographic change, globalization, climate change, and European integration.
With respect to digitalization, Germany tends to fluctuate between excessive enthusiasm for expanding fiber-optic networks and fear of the impact of new, largely unregulated business models, such as those underpinning avatars of the “sharing economy” like Uber and Airbnb.
But German policymakers must not respond to such sentiments with kneejerk reactions.
Rolling out a nationwide fiber-optic network, rather than simply servicing the locales that are most in need, would be both expensive and inefficient.
And politicians should focus their regulatory efforts on ensuring that sensible digital business models and private investment are not obstructed.
With digitalization also comes automation and robotization, which many fear will lead to job losses.
Consequently, one now regularly encounters proposals for an unconditional universal basic income (UBI), to be paid for, perhaps, with a tax on robots.
But such a response would be a terrible mistake – a capitulation to the challenges that we face.
Instead of making a large swath of the population dependent on transfers earned by others, Germany’s leaders should ensure that all workers receive the training needed to pursue opportunities in the labor market of the future.
As it happens, Germany’s aging population and declining workforce will create labor shortages in the years ahead.
But instead of seizing the opportunity in front of them, German policymakers have been busy worrying about the elimination of skilled labor altogether.
These fears make no sense.
In 1900, 38% of the labor force in Germany worked in agriculture; in 2000, only 2% did.
And yet the full-scale automation of agriculture did not lead to mass unemployment.
Germany’s demographic transformation will have significant implications for the country’s public finances, and especially for its social-insurance system.
But in the recent federal election campaign, both of Germany’s main political parties ruled out proposals to raise the retirement age to 70, even though there are good reasons for doing precisely that.
Raising the retirement age to shore up a statutory pension scheme is often denounced as unfair, because people with physically demanding jobs, such as nurses and manual laborers, cannot be expected to work until they are 70.
But that is a problem that should be addressed through higher wages and disability insurance, not with pension insurance.
And besides, early retirement can still be made an option, as long as it is marked down accordingly.
Globalization – whether it takes the form of migration or flows of trade, capital, and data – poses an equally large challenge, even though it has been a boon to Germany in recent decades.
Generally speaking, globalization implies a narrower scope for national policy.
And this is particularly true for Germany, because it has signed on to international agreements brokered by the European Union as a whole.
Growing cross-border mobility has put Germany under severe competitive pressure.
Germany wants to attract companies and investment, but it also wants to create as many high-paying jobs as possible.
Germany thus benefits from immigrants with above-average qualifications, because they will earn enough to pay more in taxes than they receive in state benefits.
To bring in capital and high-skill immigrants, Germany needs to keep taxes low.
But this limits its ability to use taxation as a mechanism for redistribution.
For now, Germany can still finance its welfare state.
But with such a globalized economy, it cannot count on subsidies funded by general tax revenues to offset future shortfalls in its social-security system.
More to the point, Germany cannot indefinitely keep taxes low while offering generous social transfers to lower-skill workers; eventually, its welfare system would collapse.
And the government should work with other countries and within the EU to ensure that immigration is not motivated by a desire for welfare benefits.
To remain competitive, Germany needs to change how it taxes investment and innovation.
French President Emmanuel Macron’s government has announced plans to abolish France’s wealth tax and significantly reduce its corporate-tax rate.
The governments of Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States have also announced plans to cut taxes.
The German government, whether it likes it or not, cannot escape the effects of global tax competition.
But as it looks for ways to improve its tax regime, it must not allow certain sectors – not least those with heavily digitalized business models – to evade taxation entirely.
Climate change is another facet of globalization, because here, too, there is nothing that Germany can do by itself to halt global warming.
Rather, the government must work with its European partners to forge global climate agreements, while enacting measures to mitigate the effects of climate change at home.
But as Germany pursues its emissions reductions, it should keep an eye on cost-effectiveness, because no climate agenda can succeed without social acceptance.
Viewed from this perspective, selective interventions, such as a proposed ban on internal combustion engines after 2030, would thus be counterproductive.
A far better approach would be to include road traffic in the emissions-metering system under the Paris climate agreement, because this would allow emissions cuts to be made at the lowest possible cost.
The last major challenge for Germany’s next government is its policy toward Europe.
Germany needs the EU to surmount its current crisis, deepen the internal market, and develop a common defense and security policy, so that it can reap the benefits of European integration.
Joint arms procurement and closer operational cooperation would yield significant efficiency gains, and reduce the burden on EU member states’ budgets.
Moreover, the European Monetary Union is in desperate need of reform.
Instead of waiting for the next crisis to erupt, Germany should see to it that European banks hold fewer domestic government bonds.
In cases where individual member states have incurred too much debt, private creditors – not taxpayers of other countries – should bear the burden of debt restructuring.
The Chimera of Franco-German Reform
CAMBRIDGE – An abiding truth in the United States is that all politics is local.
Apparently, the same wisdom can be applied (to some extent) to the European Union, whose agenda ultimately depends on key member states’ national politics.
This is particularly true with respect to eurozone institutions, which almost everyone agrees are in urgent need of reform.
Indeed, shoring up the eurozone was the common thread in major speeches by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and French President Emmanuel Macron last month.
In his State of the Union address, Juncker boldly outlined his ambitious vision for Europe’s future.
He called on the EU to complete its banking union, establish a European finance ministry (fully integrated into the Commission), and expand the EU-level budget.
Macron, in a speech at the Sorbonne, touched on issues ranging from defense and security to eurozone reform and Europe’s political divides.
But he left much unsaid.
And, in line with his role as a national leader, his was an inter-governmental, not a community perspective.
Still, both speeches were clearly intended to frame the political debate now underway in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is trying to form a new coalition government.
Many observers had hoped that Germany’s recent federal election would open a “window of opportunity” for EU-level reforms.
But it is now starting to look like that window has already closed.
The fate of any EU agenda – whether Juncker’s or Macron’s – rests with Merkel, who is unlikely to make any significant political moves.
Indeed, bold action of the type Juncker and Macron have proposed would not just be uncharacteristic for Merkel; it would also require her to invest all of her remaining political capital.
Throughout her career, Merkel has always behaved, not unreasonably, as if her main goal was to be reelected.
And because the CDU would prefer to dominate a government – and if possible, govern without coalition partners – it has always sought to win a majority by appealing to German voters in the middle of the political spectrum.
Merkel has a keen sense of where the middle is, and how and when it might shift.
Accordingly, she often adopts her competitors’ ideas.
While in office, she has established a minimum wage, lowered the retirement age to 63 (for those with 45 years of contributions), and legalized same-sex marriage – policies that are anathema to traditional conservatism, but that now have broad popular support.
As the American economist Harold Hotelling explained in 1929, those competing for the middle have an “undue tendency … to imitate each other.”
Accordingly, the CDU and its main competitor, the Social Democrats (SPD), have become increasingly indistinguishable.
And, as a corollary, smaller parties seeking an electoral foothold have had to target political minorities, many of whom have strongly held preferences and beliefs.
Because the CDU and the SPD lost support in the recent election, with the latter deciding to spend the coming electoral term in the opposition, Merkel will need to form a coalition with such parties.
But no mainstream German party, let alone Merkel’s, would govern with the third-largest faction in the Bundestag, Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right anti-EU party that garnered 13% of the vote.
That leaves the Free Democrats (FDP), who are liberal in a European sense, but also frustrated with the eurozone’s malaise.
Giving voice to German “transfer fatigue”, the FDP is adamantly opposed to any arrangement that transfers German money to underperforming member states.
During the campaign, the FDP thus drew a red line against furnishing the EU with a fiscal capacity, under any guise.
Two other FDP proposals – a sovereign-debt-restructuring mechanism, to force creditors to take responsibility for their decisions, and temporary withdrawal from the common currency for over-indebted member states – could further complicate matters for eurozone reformers.
The FDP’s ideas have broad support in Germany and among German economists (and are shared by a number of other European economists).
And they are consistent with positions taken by the German Ministry of Finance under the previous government.
But policies that might work in a perfect world of efficient and resilient financial markets could be dangerous if applied in highly imperfect real-world markets.
As we saw a decade ago, financial institutions operating in an environment of uncertainty can become fragile and collapse, imposing high costs on society.
The idea of a temporary exit from the euro is particularly ill-advised.
If that option were formalized, markets would price it in, and member states without deep capital markets would pay a premium.
Their interest rates would be structurally higher.
And under volatile conditions, they are prone to face runs from fickle institutional investors, wary of rolling over their credit lines.
The FDP campaigned on an exit option, and its leaders, having been out of parliament for four years, will not want to risk their credibility by backing away from it now.
And besides, some deputies in the CDU, and many in its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, are sympathetic to the FDP’s positions.
The third likely member in Merkel’s new coalition, the Greens, would hardly be able to counterbalance these internal forces.
Another problem is that neither Juncker nor Macron has offered much in the way of detail.
The actual design of a future eurozone budget – and the types of expenditure it would include – is still unclear.
So, too, is the process for holding a eurozone finance minister accountable and ensuring his or her democratic legitimacy.
It is also not evident how much national sovereignty would be lost, in the name of a shared fiscal capacity.
Sorting out these questions will require a level of political entrepreneurship unlike anything Merkel has ever shown.
To join in Macron’s European project, she would have to assume an entirely new role and expose herself to substantial political risks.
Germany would have to take the initiative: rather than rejecting proposals, it would have to offer its own.
Such behavior can hardly be expected from a government that, beholden to the median German voter, plays it safe.
The German political center has been shifting, and it is heading in a different direction than Juncker and Macron.
As a result, the eurozone’s institutional design will likely remain incomplete.
Germany’s Dangerous Nuclear Flirtation
BERLIN – As in a game of chess, there are geopolitical moves through which a country can – unwittingly – checkmate itself.
Opening a debate on German nuclear weapons would be such a move.
Yet this is exactly what some Germans have recently proposed.
Supporters of a nuclear-armed Germany contend that NATO’s nuclear umbrella has lost all credibility because of statements made by US President Donald Trump.
There are at least three good reasons why considering a nuclear option would be foolhardy for Germany.
For starters, Germany has repeatedly renounced it, first in 1969 by signing (and later ratifying) the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and then in 1990 by signing the so-called Two Plus Four Treaty, which paved the way for German reunification.
Casting doubt on these commitments would severely damage Germany’s reputation and reliability worldwide.
Germany would call into question the credibility of NATO’s nuclear deterrence, and thus the alliance itself, along with the entire nuclear non-proliferation regime.
It is worth noting that since its creation in 1949, NATO has been one of the world’s most successful instruments of proliferation prevention.
Not a single NATO member state – apart from the United States, the United Kingdom, and France – has found it necessary to acquire nuclear weapons of its own.
If Germany were now to break out of its non-nuclear power status, what would keep Turkey or Poland, for instance, from following suit?
Germany as a gravedigger of the international non-proliferation regime – who could want that?
Second, a German nuclear bomb would damage the strategic environment in Europe – to Germany’s disadvantage.
Russia would interpret German steps toward a nuclear arsenal as a direct threat to its own national security and would likely adopt military countermeasures.
That, in turn, would make it even harder to pursue the vision of a pan-European order of peace and security, a core foreign-policy goal of all German governments since that of Konrad Adenauer.
Moreover, a German nuclear ambition might jeopardize the delicate balance of power in Europe – including between Germany and France, for example – with incalculable consequences for the long-term cohesion of the European Union.
Finally, it is not hard to predict that the pursuit of nuclear weapons would draw significant public opposition, especially given that such a move would be a complete about-face for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, which, just a few years ago, moved to phase out nuclear energy altogether.
It is difficult to imagine a greater fiasco for German foreign and security policy than proposing a nuclear strategy and then failing to obtain parliamentary approval.
There are smarter long-term ways to bolster Europe’s nuclear defense than introducing a German bomb.
For example, France might be willing to consider playing an extended nuclear-deterrence role, along with the roles of the US and the United Kingdom within NATO.
While this would require a fundamental reorientation and Europeanization of France’s nuclear strategy, Germany and other European partners could offer financial contributions to such an initiative, in the context of a future European defense union with a nuclear component.
But these are, at best, long-term options.
In short, no matter what Trump says, Germany will remain dependent on the US nuclear umbrella for the foreseeable future.
The best way to maintain NATO’s credibility and be taken seriously by the US is to work seriously toward the alliance’s 2%-of-GDP target for defense spending and to invest more heavily in conventional military capabilities, not to satisfy US demands, but to protect our own security and defense interests.
But this is not simply about spending more; it is about spending more intelligently, particularly by pooling and sharing capabilities, and by systematic joint procurement with France and other European partners, including through the recently established EU Defense Fund.
None of this will work if Germany will not start defining military strategy, security, and defense as top political priorities.
Only then will the Bundestag be able to give the Bundeswehr – often referred to as a “parliamentary army” – what it needs to do its job.
The alternative – considering the development of nuclear weapons – would be a game-losing move.
Germany’s Strange Turn Against Trade
BERLIN – The window of opportunity to complete the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the United States and the European Union is closing quickly.
National elections will be held this year and next in the US, France, and Germany, and the campaigns will play out in an environment that is increasingly hostile to international agreements in any form.
The biggest risk might come from the least likely source: Germany, an export powerhouse.
As it stands, some 70% of Germans citizens oppose the TTIP, almost twice the average in other European countries.
They overwhelmingly believe that Germany will not benefit economically, that lower-skill workers’ wages will suffer, that large corporations will gain power at the expense of consumers, that data and environmental protection will be compromised, and that citizens’ rights will be undermined.
But a slew of studies have proved all of these claims to be overblown or outright wrong.
In fact, Germany – whose economic progress since the end of World War II has been driven by its consistent openness to international trade and economic integration, and which remains one of Europe’s most open and trade-dependent economies – would be among the main beneficiaries of the TTIP.
It is projected that the TTIP would raise annual per capita income in Germany by 1-3%, or €300-1,000 per year by 2035.
Moreover, with nearly 50% of German jobs linked, directly or indirectly, to the tradable sector, the deal would also help protect employment.
And, by boosting the ability of the US and Europe to set global business standards, German firms’ international competitiveness would rise.
Not every individual or company stands to gain from the TTIP, but the net effect on Germany’s economy and citizens would be clearly positive.
Why, then, do so many in Germany oppose the deal?
One reason is that Germany’s apparent economic success has increased aversion to change.
The country not only endured the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the European sovereign debt crisis; it has actually thrived in recent years, experiencing robust GDP growth and impressive wage gains.
The unemployment rate has been halved since 2005, reaching a record low of 4.6% today, and its current-account surplus has soared to a staggering 8% of GDP.
The sense of being Europe’s economic superstar has generated policy inertia, bringing the country almost to a complete standstill on economic reforms.
While most other Europeans are desperately looking for any opportunity to pull their country out of crisis, Germans see little reason to meddle with an ostensibly prosperous status quo.
Unfortunately for Germany, its current path is not as smooth and secure as people like to think.
In fact, since its lost decade as the “sick man of Europe” in the 2000s, Germany has caught up with other advanced economies in only some areas.
It still has one of the lowest rates of public and private investment among OECD countries, and will be hit harder than most by a dramatic demographic shift over the next decade.
Beyond providing an immediate economic boost, the TTIP would help Germany weather the longer-term challenges it faces.
Germany’s opposition to the TTIP also reflects the recent surge in populist and nationalist sentiment in much of the Western world.
The appeal of such forces is particularly pronounced in the EU, owing to the popular perception that European integration has weakened national sovereignty and left citizens subject to decision-making by unelected technocrats.
The last thing many Europeans want is yet another set of supra-national rules, formulated behind closed doors, governing their economies.
This sentiment is especially acute for Germans, who remain bitter at, as they perceive it, having been Europe’s paymaster during the crisis.
Some now fear that the TTIP is just another trick, intended to take advantage of Germany’s economic strength and generosity.
Overcoming this fear will be no easy feat.
A third reason for Germany’s opposition to the TTIP is that the country is already engaged in a battle for wealth redistribution.
Germany currently has the highest inequality in private wealth in the eurozone, and it has experienced a sharp increase in wage inequality over the last two decades.
In fact, many Germans anticipate a further increase in inequality.
Not only is the minimum wage widely circumvented; some politicians have capitalized on fears of the current influx of refugees to win votes, claiming that openness to foreigners will only make inequality worse.
Compounding Germans’ disillusionment is the sense – shared by many in Europe and elsewhere – that the system is “rigged.”
Volkswagen managers received huge bonuses this year, despite the global scandal caused by the company’s years-long effort to evade emissions standards. And the release of the Panama Papers has revealed how the wealthiest avoid paying taxes.
Claims that the TTIP would benefit primarily the wealthy have thus struck a chord with labor unions and others.
A trade-dependent economy has much to gain from freer trade, especially with a market as large as the US.
Germany should be using its political clout to push its European counterparts to seal the deal.
Instead, with the popularity of the country’s two largest political parties, the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democrats, falling fast, Germany’s leaders are unlikely to push an unpopular deal.
That is bad news for everyone – especially Germans.
The German Rules Trap
PARIS – Europe has a new German problem.
Unlike in the past, it stems neither from hegemonic ambitions nor from the sort of weakness that might tempt aggression.
Instead, it is rooted in Germany’s abdication of any sense of shared responsibility for Europe, despite boasting as robust an economy as it has had since 1945.
The result of Germany’s approach – “do as we do, or leave us alone” – is inertia, at a moment when Europe desperately needs momentum.
For a long time, Europe was at the center of German concerns.
In 1994, for example, Wolfgang Schäuble – then parliamentary leader of the Christian Democratic Union, and now President of the Bundestag – and his CDU colleague Karl Lamers wrote a paper calling for the EU’s “core” countries, including France, to move swiftly toward closer integration, including political union.
France resisted German pressure because it was extremely suspicious of political federalism.
Then-president François Mitterrand did not want to move beyond the Maastricht framework.
After the 2010 eurozone crisis, the debate shifted toward structural reforms.
France advocated for more economic integration, but Germany conditioned any discussion of the eurozone’s future on French structural reforms.
President François Hollande agreed in principle to that trade-off, but lacked the time and political support to implement it.
Today, however, France is finally undertaking Germany’s long-expected domestic reforms – and pressing for change at the EU level.
French President Emmanuel Macron wants to create not a federal Europe – nobody is proposing that – but a sovereign EU capable of resisting the pressure of figures like US President Donald Trump, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping, and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Unfortunately, Germany is once more resisting French proposals.
Though Chancellor Angela Merkel often lavishes Macron with praise for his courage and policy goals, she seems reluctant to agree to any action to strengthen the EU.
German leaders concede that French reforms are good for France, but now argue that eurozone reform is a separate issue.
Although disappointing, this stance is not unexpected.
Merkel is politically weakened, and German public opinion remains deeply influenced by the false narrative that the country is Europe’s paymaster.
Schäuble, a former euro federalist, has scaled back his ambitions dramatically.
While he still dreams of a European Monetary Fund, it would only resemble a solidarity mechanism.
Its main purpose would be to monitor and punish fiscally lax states for the purpose of reducing further the European Commission’s budgetary oversight responsibilities.
The truth is that Germany aspires to live in a minimalist Europe that lacks any political union, but is tied to intergovernmental disciplinary mechanisms designed by its most prosperous countries.
In other words, Germany wants to eliminate from the EU all traces of community spirit, and the politics that go with it, and replace them with an austere idyll of rigid rules.
And current events in Italy are reinforcing the position of German hardliners.
It is probably no coincidence that three days after the new Italian government revealed its economic plan – which, if implemented, will blow up the eurozone – 154 German economists published a manifesto strongly opposing any substantial eurozone reform.
But this stance also reflects the so-called ordoliberal principles that underpin German thought and that shape Germany’s understanding of the eurozone crisis.
Along with the Netherlands and the Baltic states, Germany blames that crisis on some member states’ budgetary imprudence and insufficient monitoring of private debt, and thus refuses to examine properly the eurozone’s systemic problems.
Eight years later, Europeans still embrace divergent narratives about the crisis.
How can we expect them to move toward the future if they strongly disagree on the past?
To acknowledge that the eurozone can function only on a foundation of solidarity and interdependence would be to engage in precisely the kind of thinking that German ordoliberals have always rejected.
They see the national economy as the sum of microeconomic decisions, and a supranational economy as the sum of national economies.
For them, solidarity is founded on consistent management.
This reasoning leads to three lines of argument that preclude basic strategic analysis.
First, Germany embraces the self-serving fiction that it owes nothing to others for its prosperity.
Yet we know very well how much Germany’s economy depends on European demand, and how much it benefits from the undervaluation of the “German euro” (whereas the “Italian euro,” for example, suffers from overvaluation).
Germany also gains the most from European Central Bank policy.
As the German economist Marcel Fratzscher recently tweeted, “The unbearable cynicism of some German politicians and economists: they attack ECB policy, yet Germany’s government is its biggest beneficiary – €294 billion in interest savings since 2007.
Compare that to risks assumed in the crisis, and it is an excellent deal for Germany.”
Second, Germany insists that any slowdown should be met with greater discipline and tighter austerity, not countercyclical policies.
According to German leaders, no matter how severe the effects of that approach may be, they are simply the price of redemption after committing the sin of accumulating excessive debt.
Finally, Germany is convinced that, in a market economy, the state’s responsibility is to set rules, not to steer the choices of economic actors.
In fact, a recent report from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy portrays Germany’s enormous current-account surplus as a reality that policymakers cannot change, and that thus must be accommodated.
This ignores the fact, highlighted by a recent study by Guntram B. Wolff, that Germany’s current-account surplus is the result not of aging households’ frenzied desire to save more, but of underinvestment by businesses seeking to resist wage pressure.
This presents France with a serious challenge.
One option for overcoming German obstinacy would be to pursue a series of small compromises.
But, as some critical German observers, such as the Financial Times’ Wolfgang Münchau, have pointed out, this could lead to minimal and even illusory concessions.
The alternative would be a showdown that brings the debate to the European public.
Perhaps this is what Macron was trying to initiate at Aix-la-Chapelle earlier this month, as he collected from Merkel the Charlemagne Prize for his pro-European efforts.
Such a confrontation need not block progress on other issues, such as border security, investments in industries of the future, taxation of US tech giants, and the defense of multilateralism.
European integration owes much to France’s Robert Schuman and Germany’s Helmut Kohl, both of whom prioritized strategic European interests (through the European Steel and Coal Community and the eurozone, respectively) over the pursuit of immediate national advantage.
Today, Macron is prepared to establish himself as a similar leader, but he needs a reliable German partner willing to challenge ordoliberal rigor in the name of Europe-wide prosperity.
Unfortunately, it is not at all clear that he has such a partner in Merkel.
Germany’s Drift from Europe
BERLIN – “What’s the matter with Germany?,” people on both sides of the Atlantic are asking with increasing frequency.
In Berlin, however, nobody seems to understand the question.
Doubts about Germany’s role have much to do with the current economic and financial crisis, and also with the weakness of the European Union and its institutions.
Ever since the referendum failures of both the European constitution and the Lisbon treaty, the EU has been flying on autopilot, run by its bureaucrats.
With 27 members and no reform of its institutions and procedures, EU processes have become harrowingly inefficient.
Crises are also always moments of truth, because they relentlessly expose both the strengths and weaknesses of all the players involved.
For that reason, Europe now requires leadership not from a weak EU Commission or from any other European institutions, but from the capitals of its major member countries.
As always, when serious economic and financial matters are at stake, people look to Germany, the EU’s largest economy.
But what they see confounds them, because Germany is openly refusing to lead.
True, Germany has been hit hard – very hard – by the economic crisis.
But its economy is nonetheless stronger than ever after the challenges of reunification and the necessary reform of the country’s labor market and welfare systems.
What amazes our neighbors and partners – and increasingly causes distrust – is that ever since the beginning of the global meltdown last September, the German government has focused almost exclusively on national crisis management, rebuffing any and all attempts at a European approach.
Add to this the palpable tensions in Franco-German relations, the blocking of a common EU gas market, close strategic cooperation with Vladimir Putin’s Russia, etc., and the worries about Germany multiply.
It’s not just that there is fear in Berlin that any European solution would be much more expensive for Germany and take a lot longer; this new form of German euroskepticism also shows a fundamental change of attitude amongst the overwhelming majority of Germany’s political and economic elite.
The change is evident by asking a single question: would it still be possible today to give up the D-Mark and introduce the euro as a common currency?
The answer is a resounding no.
Regardless of whether it’s Chancellor Angela Merkel or Foreign Minister Frank Steinmeier, this answer reverberates across the political spectrum, and it is held irrespective of which parties or people form the government.
Following the changing of the guard after the end of Germany’s red/green coalition, a fundamental shift in attitude has gradually taken place.
Europe today is no longer seen as the key project in German politics in which people are willing to invest an essential part of their political capital – and thus of their own future.
Rather, 20 years after the fall of the Berlin wall, the reunited Germany is beginning to realize that it can also act alone.
The problem, of course, is that this is a huge misapprehension.
Germany’s relationship with Europe is seen as a functional one by nearly all the democratic parties.
But, while Europe no doubt remains important for asserting both common and national interests, it is no longer a project of the future.
The German perspective is thus shifting in the direction of that of France and the United Kingdom: the EU is increasingly seen as a framework and precondition for asserting national interests, rather than as an aim in itself.
The reasons for this profound change are obvious: the reunification and the historical resolution of the hitherto open “German question”; the failure of the EU constitution and thus of the European vision; the institutional weakness of an expanded 27-member EU; and the increasing inefficiency and slowness of EU institutions.
So will Germany revert to nationalism?
All political players in Berlin reject this charge with great indignation.
Indeed, there is no strategy or master plan whatsoever for a return to nationalism.
The fundamental change in Germany’s European policy is simply happening – the result of a process that could almost be termed “organic.”
As such, this does not makes the drift in German policy – which manifests itself, for example, in a refusal to lead in the present crisis – any better.
It is a strategic illusion of the large member states that they can defend their own status without this stolid entity called Europe.
After all, can Germany really afford to let the EU’s enlargement into Eastern Europe fail?
Can it afford a life-threatening crisis of the euro, a common market endangered by growing protectionism, or Russia pushing into the EU’s Eastern neighborhood?
Can it really conduct an independent national policy in the Middle East and Africa, or play an effective role in resolving global issues, from addressing climate change to building a new financial order?
To ask these questions – and many more – is to answer them: only a strong, substantially more integrated EU can manage all this.
But this EU will have a future only if its member governments and peoples are willing to invest a substantial part of their political success and their national interests.
And this applies above all, as it did in the past, to Germany, in the heart of the continent, with the EU’s largest population and economy, and, last but not least, with its difficult past.
Europe’s Economic Groupthink
FRANKFURT – During the recent hearing on the constitutionality of the European Central Bank’s measures to prevent the eurozone from falling apart, Andreas Vosskuhle, President of Germany’s Constitutional Court, raised an important question: Do non-German economists condemn the ECB’s outright monetary transactions (OMT) as unequivocally as all but one of the German experts testifying?
Of course, there are German economists (not to mention Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government) who support ECB President Mario Draghi’s policies.
Still, an overwhelming majority of German (and possibly Dutch and Finnish) economists seem to favor keeping the ECB on the sidelines in the eurozone crisis.
It’s a fiscal issue, the typical German economist says, and monetary policy will not help; on the contrary, activating it will only make matters worse.
Of course, everyone would prefer it if the line between monetary and fiscal policy had not become blurred as a result of the crisis.
But blindly sticking to principle would have been a highly risky option for the ECB.
It would have meant accepting in 2012 what has been called “redenomination risk” – economic newspeak for a eurozone breakup.
Nonetheless, by launching its OMT scheme, the ECB has committed German (and other northern European) taxpayers, without their parliaments’ approval, to a potential obligation to bail out – well, whom, exactly?
Indeed, it appears that the typical northern European taxpayer supports the typical stakeholder in northern European banks that are over-exposed to southern European debtors.
Likewise, German legal scholars interpret the ECB’s activities as being incompatible with European treaty provisions that prohibit bailouts and monetary financing of the debt of eurozone members.
And one can easily understand civil servants’ strong reluctance to disregard legal obligations and risk criminal liability for breach of trust.
Germany’s Constitutional Court, of course, does not write the rules.
But its obligation is to render a dispassionate reading of legal agreements, and it is renowned for doing so, which is one reason why it is the country’s most trusted institution.
Nonetheless, the ECB is right that it is faced with very different monetary conditions in different member states; indeed, the eurozone is akin to a badly working fixed-exchange-rate system, with all of the attendant risks.
Ultimately, limiting the ECB to its conventional tool kit amounts to accepting the risk of a eurozone collapse.
Against this backdrop, institutional investors self-insured – quite rationally – against a eurozone breakup by withdrawing behind safer borders.
With fiscal policy incapable of responding, the ECB was stuck with a second intermediation role: mitigating with its Target2 system the effects of European financial markets re-segmenting along national lines.
This is fiscal dominance in its purest form.
It is here that Vosskuhle’s question matters the most.
Debates within eurozone member states typically converge on what legal scholars call herrschende Meinung (“dominant opinion”), which, in turn, appears to reflect their countries’ status as creditors or debtors.
Reinforcing this, the typical career-conscious economist has little incentive to deviate.
The media are no remedy, as competition for ratings forces them to favor oversimplification over differentiation, complexity, and nuance.
In terms of substance – which the German Constitutional Court explicitly and intentionally avoids – the case for OMT has always been about preventing a liquidity crisis from morphing into a solvency problem, especially on the eurozone’s periphery.
From an investor’s perspective, the mechanics of this are simple: all are reluctant to hold private or public debt from a country that is vulnerable to redenomination.
This by itself creates a rollover risk, which is why, for example, a small firm in Bozen (Bolzano, in Italy’s South Tyrol) is subject to higher financing costs than its competitor in Innsbruck (in Austria’s northern Tyrol).
The OMT scheme’s success depends on an unlimited capacity to intervene – to do “whatever it takes,” as Draghi famously put it.
Legally constraining this capacity would be self-defeating.
So, if the OMT scheme is not feasible under current treaty provisions, these provisions – which, after all, are of human, not divine, origin – must be amended.
But a treaty change would require engaging the European public – and, in several member states, submitting the proposed revisions to popular referenda.
Given how often such referenda have been defeated in recent years – for example, in France, the Netherlands, and Ireland – that is a scenario that everyone wants to avoid.
What is dispiriting is that we ponder these arguments so infrequently.
In fact, the minimal prerequisites for a working monetary union are not discussed upfront and transparently anywhere.
With politicians focused on the median voter, and a groupthink-generating media, the eurozone muddles through, just barely surviving.
But, if the eurozone is to be a sensible long-term proposition, mere survival is not enough.
The main justification for a monetary union cannot be the possibly disastrous consequences of its falling apart.
Even less convincing is the neo-mercantilist point that the eurozone would allow for indefinite current-account surpluses (it does not).
Originally, Europe’s monetary union was supposed to provide a stable framework for its deeply integrated economies to enhance living standards sustainably.
It still can.
But this requires acknowledging what the crisis has revealed: the eurozone’s institutional flaws.
Remedying them calls for a minimum of federalism and commensurate democratic legitimacy – and thus for greater openness to institutional adaptation.
Germany’s Fiscal Follies
PRINCETON – All over the world, public-sector deficits are exploding.
Governments face massive costs rescuing banks and businesses hit by the financial and economic crisis. There is a universal consensus that Keynesian stimulus is needed.
At the same time, policymakers are looking more and more nervously for an “exit strategy.”
They know that they cannot run deficits forever, but they do not want to say when the painful exit should begin.
Germany is different, not because it is not spending now, but in how it talks about the future.
The German government has taken a peculiarly aggressive line in attacking deficits and in trying to lay down a firm exit strategy.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has criticized the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England for “quantitative easing,” which has in practice allowed the central bank to monetize many types of government and non-government debt.
The German government also successfully passed a constitutional law requiring the government deficit to be capped at 0.35% of GDP in 2016 and eliminated by 2020.
Both the attacks on excessively easy central banks and the effort to limit government debt are enormously popular in Germany.
But they have been widely condemned by economists worldwide (including in Germany) as nonsense.
Merkel is not the first German politician to adopt a hardline stance on monetary policy and debt – nor is she the first to face a torrent of international criticism.
In the late 1970’s, when the world was facing a mixture of stagnant growth and inflation, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt insistently told British, French, and American leaders that their deficits were wrong and dangerous.
He believed that the solution to stagflation “was that those with deficits should get rid of them.”
His fellow leaders began to think Schmidt arrogant.
The most obvious explanation for the German peculiarity is an obsession with the lessons of German history, particularly the two episodes of runaway inflation in the twentieth century, in which holders of monetary assets were expropriated.
The Great Inflation of the early 1920’s, which culminated in a hyper-inflation in which prices changed several times daily, destroyed the middle classes and bred the political instability that eventually opened the way to Hitler’s rise.
Hitler repeatedly promised that he would use any means to fight inflation, but his militarism also led to the expropriation of savings.
Even though only quite old people have personally experienced even the second of these episodes of monetary destruction, their political resonance is still acute. Germany’s mass circulation Bild Zeitung warned in a headline in March 2009 of inflation at a time when all price signals pointed in the opposite direction.
Merkel has acute political antennae, and her response struck a deep chord with popular sentiment.
A second rationale for Germany’s policy is demographic.
Budget limitation appeals not just to the old, but is especially attractive to young people, who worry that they will be made to pay the costs of caring for an increasingly elderly and dependent population.
There is a third explanation for Germany’s particular stance.
With governments around the world (including Germany’s) accumulating unprecedented levels of peacetime debt, markets are worrying about sustainability.
Some crisis-prone countries such as Latvia are already unable to sell any more debt.
But even large and stable countries such as Britain and the US are finding auctions of government paper increasingly problematic.
Big investors, particularly Asian countries’ reserve funds, are increasingly nervous.
A cast-iron mechanism to ensure that the debt build-up does not continue forever is appealing as a way of withstanding increasingly fraught competition for funding.
Germany will look like a better credit risk, thereby allowing it to fund its current budget deficits more easily and cheaply.
There is obviously some element of bluff in legislating balanced budgets.
Extravagant promises to behave better at some future point are not completely credible, although they often have a short-term impact.
In 1985, the US Congress passed the Gramm-Rudman Act, which provided for automatic spending cuts in the case of deficits.
It was ruled unconstitutional, but it began a process of budget consolidation.
The European Union’s Maastricht criteria, which cap deficits at 3% of GDP, belong in the same category: a measure that could be relaxed as the political pressure changed, but which did help initially in reducing deficits and borrowing costs.
The real problem with the German measure is not so much our lack of knowledge about what the world will look like in 2016 or 2020 as it is that Germany is politically and economically bound to European integration, and thus tied to states with very different budgetary perspectives and priorities.
As a result, it makes little sense for Germany to compete to have more solid budgets than its neighbors: all European countries have tied themselves together.
When Germans tie their hands with constitutional budget laws, they are in effect untying their neighbors’.
Europe’s monetary unification of the 1990’s was supposed to be accompanied by fiscal convergence and harmonization.
When budgets move in different directions, pressures shift to regional policy (to redistribute income) and to monetary policy (to boost growth).
The prospects for friction between EU members escalate.
The best hope for Germany is that people – both German voters and Chinese fund managers – will take such promises seriously now, but forget about them in ten years.
Germany’s Five Election Unknowns
On September 18, Germany will hold an election that contains at least five unknowns.
If it were an equation, it would be impossible to solve.
Fortunately, politics is not mathematics – though, unfortunately, this means that there are no clear solutions.
Indeed, even in the opaque terms of contemporary politics, the German case is particularly vexing.
The first unknown is why the election is taking place at all.
Chancellor Gerhard Schröder had another fifteen months to go before the end of the electoral term, and it seemed that he had no difficulty mobilizing his admittedly slender majority in parliament.
To be sure, the big issues that the Federal President listed when he dissolved the Bundestag are real.
The fiscal position is, by German standards, unacceptable, and public debt at current levels is contrary to the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact and a burden on future generations.
Demographic developments alone require major reforms of social policy.
Moreover, the institutions of the federal system do not permit decisions to be made either expeditiously or clearly.
None of this is new, nor will it be changed by an election.
So it is not obvious to many people why they are voting.
The second unknown concerns what, exactly, separates the major parties in this contest.
The Social Democrats (SPD) and the Christian Democrats (CDU) are both committed to the “social market economy,” to the essentials of corporatist economic management, to maintaining the entitlements of the welfare state, and to the EU and NATO.
True, the campaign has brought out nuances that may turn out to be important.
Schröder’s SPD uses the word “social” a little more emphatically than it did in the last seven years.
The opposition CDU leader, Angela Merkel, has linked its program to the ambitious ideas of an outsider, former Constitutional Court judge Paul Kirchhof, seeking a dramatic simplification of the tax system.
In international affairs, Merkel is more skeptical about European enlargement, notably to include Turkey, than Schröder.
Merkel, an East German by background, is also more cautious in her approach to Russia.
But these are nuances, not fundamental differences.
The third unknown is the performance of the Left Party, a new formation positioned to the left of the SPD and built on East Germany’s ex-communist PDS, with the addition of a significant number of dissident Social Democrats in the West who proclaim themselves to be defenders of the welfare state.
The Left Party is led by two talk show politicians, Gregor Gysi, the former PDS leader, and Oskar Lafontaine, the ex-leader of the SPD, who do not have much more in common than a record of political failure and a talent for populist speeches.
But this clearly appeals to those who feel that they have been neglected and forgotten.
The popular vote for this party – which could be 10% – may well determine what kind of coalition is formed after the election.
The fourth unknown is therefore what the next government will actually do.
It will clearly be a government without the new Left Party.
It will also be a government without the Greens, who continue to have a devoted, if limited, clientele, but are now regarded by many as a luxury that Germany can no longer afford.
This leaves two possibilities: a coalition between the CDU, its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, and the liberal Free Democrats, or a grand coalition between the SPD and the CDU.
The latter is what most Germans want; the former is what they are most likely to get.
But most people doubt whether it even makes a difference, and they are probably right.
There is a widespread desire for change, including a change of government, but there is an equally widespread belief that nothing momentous will happen.
This underscores the final, and deepest, unknown concerning the upcoming election: who will put a confused and directionless Germany back on a road to initiative and growth?
Who will make Germany an engine of Europe again rather than a gloomy passenger?
What Germany needs is, in fact, fairly clear.
It needs to accept that globalization is above all an opportunity, one that must be grasped by confident, innovative, and entrepreneurial people.
Germans need to understand again – as they did so well after 1945 – that their future lies in their own hands, as citizens, rather than in the power of some remote State.
Above all, Germany must appreciate that the changes it needs are improvements that would guarantee its future security.
Perhaps what it requires most is a touch of Margaret Thatcher’s policies of the 1980’s, combined with Tony Blair’s rhetoric of today.
But it remains to be seen whether, or when, that might be on offer.
Germany’s Five Shocks
Over the last decade, Germany has been the slowest growing economy in the European Union, and Europe has been the slowest growing continent in the world.
From 1995 to 2005, Germany will have grown by only 14.6%, while the old EU on average will have grown by 24%, the US by 39.9%, and the world economy by 45.6%.
Why has Germany performed so badly?
One theory, endorsed by the head of Germany’s ruling Social Democratic Party, Franz Müntefering, is that Germany is already where the others still want to be.
Slow German growth, he maintains, is a sign of natural convergence.
But this theory is not convincing.
Germany has recently been overtaken in terms of per capita income by several EU countries, including Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, and France, and is still growing more slowly than all of them.
Another, more plausible theory is that over the past fifteen years there have been various external challenges or shocks that have hit the country simultaneously.
Rigid as it was, with an extensive welfare system and an over-regulated labor market, Germany was unable to react to these shocks and ran into trouble.
This theory recalls that of the British historian Arnold Toynbee, according to which empires collapse because they are unable to react to external challenges.
The first shock was intensified globalization, which brought a lot of new low-wage competition.
Although globalization is a gradual process, it gained momentum when China decided to play the game.
China is ten times the size of Japan, and Japan was not easy to deal with, either.
German precision instruments and optical equipment, for example, lost their competitive edge when Japan entered the game.
The second shock was EU integration, including the northern and southern enlargements.
The dismantling of the EU’s internal borders boosted each country’s market size and brought about the predicted economies of scale.
But this helped Europe’s small countries more than the big ones, and it implied more competition for Germany, Europe’s biggest economy.
Think of Nokia, the mobile phone maker.
Due to the economies of scale that the common market made possible, Nokia was able to exploit its inventions fully, while Germany’s Siemens recently decided to give up on the mobile phone market.
The third shock was the euro, which has induced a rapid convergence of long-term interest rates, which in some countries had been five to seven percentage points above the German level.
Freed from exchange-rate risk, international investors no longer demanded a risk premium from these countries and were willing to provide funds to all of them under the same favorable conditions that previously had been reserved for Germany.
This is good for Europe, because it helps improve the allocation of capital and stimulates growth by transporting German savings to the remote and previously disadvantaged regions of the euro zone.
But it is of doubtful benefit to German workers who also would have liked to cooperate with that capital.
The fourth shock was eastern EU enlargement, which has brought extraordinary chances for trade and investment in the east, but has also brought massive low-wage competition.
On average, wage costs in the ten countries that joined the EU in 2004 are only 14% of the West German level.
Low-wage competition has led to substantial outsourcing and off-shoring activities that have kept German firms competitive by reducing their demand for domestic labor.
As neither Germany’s unions nor its welfare state would accept falling wages, the result was higher unemployment and slower growth.
The fifth shock was German unification, which is a failure in economic terms.
GDP per working-age person in East Germany had been 61% of the West German level in 1996, but it is now only 59%.
The slow growth of the eastern part of the country has pulled down the Germany-wide average, while the enormous demand for public funds in the east has increased public debt.
The weak fiscal position has in turn undermined investors’ confidence, with obvious implications for economic growth.
All five shocks constitute historical developments that are good for the world as a whole, but problematic for Germany.
In order for the country to meet the challenges and to continue to grow, it would have to make its labor markets flexible.
Only if wages adjust downward to accommodate the new international environment can German workers become competitive again, so that the country returns to a higher employment level, exploiting its human capital up to the capacity constraint.
The new government that voters will most likely elect in September will be confronted with the difficult task of confronting Germans with reality and pushing through the necessary reforms.
Only then will we know whether Germany can meet the Toynbeean challenge it is facing.
Germany’s Gold Delusion
WASHINGTON, DC – Germany’s gold is on the move.
For the first time since official gold transactions became more transparent, the Bundesbank has given notice that a significant portion of its holdings will be transferred home from France and the United States.
Ostensibly, this is just a matter of monetary housekeeping.
But why now?
One possibility is that German policymakers believe that we are approaching an every-country-for-itself scenario – and only gold guarded by one’s own police is worth anything.
But this is more than far-fetched.
The world in which financial trust breaks down completely between Germany and France or Germany and the US is one in which we have much bigger problems than where a country’s gold is located.
International trade would collapse, and major global companies would struggle to sell their products.
Having more gold at home, rather than in the vaults of the New York Fed, would be neither here nor there in such a situation.
Does Germany think that its gold will be subject to sanctions or some form of confiscation – as sometimes happens to rogue nations?
Again, this is hardly plausible.
Countries like Iran and Venezuela work long and hard to become international pariahs.
Germany, by contrast, is a mainstay of the democratic world. That is not going to change.
Perhaps German central bankers sense a longer-term shift in international preferences away from the dollar and want to be ready in some fashion.
This is plausible in terms of a future decline in the dollar’s importance as a reserve asset and safe haven.
Reserve holdings of dollar assets (primarily by central banks) were worth around 2% of US GDP in 1948 and about the same in 1968.
Today, such holdings are at least 15% of US GDP – with some estimates as high as 30%.
Much of this rise stems from growing prosperity and current-account surpluses in middle-income countries.
When you sell more to the world than you buy, you accumulate claims on the rest of the world – and you need to decide the form in which you want to hold those claims.
At present, the world holds a lot of US dollar assets, and greater diversification of portfolios in coming years would not be shocking.
There is certainly much discussion of the renminbi’s rising international role – an issue on which Arvind Subramanian, my colleague at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, continues to do the most interesting work.
But moving Germany’s gold is hardly helpful in this regard.
What would help is to turn the euro around – in the sense of convincing investors that the common currency has a bright future, because it is underpinned by a stronger monetary, fiscal, financial, and political union.
When seen in this light, the physical location of gold is purely a distraction.
It is as if German political elites think that they are back in the era of the gold standard.
But, even back then, what mattered was the amount of gold you owned – not where it was actually stored.
The broader and more worrying trend is the politicization of central banking.
Leading German political figures are becoming increasingly suspicious of the European Central Bank, while also worrying aloud about the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.
Their motivating fear is the prospect of inflation.
But the real fear is not inflation itself – that is, that prices might rise at a surprisingly fast clip this year or next. Rather, the fear is that central banks will not see inflation coming until it is too late, and that this will cause a major upward shift in inflation expectations.
Again, moving gold does nothing to keep inflation under control or change the behavior of central banks.
The link between currencies and gold was irrevocably broken in 1971, when US President Richard Nixon decided to suspend the convertibility of dollars into gold for central banks.
We have lived in a purely fiat money system ever since – meaning that our money’s value is not backed by gold or any other physical item.
Such monetary systems can succeed only as long as the central bank can credibly commit to keeping inflation under control.
German politicians would thus seem to be suffering from some serious delusions about the importance of gold and the effects of shifting its location.
But they are right to worry about the ECB’s policies: Providing unconditional credit to eurozone governments is unlikely to make these governments more careful.
There is a real danger that so-called “fiscal dominance” will undermine monetary policy and make it much harder to control inflation.
The German fascination with gold is a red herring.
Its fear of wayward monetary policy is not.
What’s the Matter With Germany?
ROME – Italy may be the “sick man of Europe” today, but it is not the only country in need of medicine.
On the contrary, even the mighty Germany seems to be coming down with something.
Italy is, to be sure, in dire straits.
Over the last two decades, annual GDP growth has averaged just 0.46%, and government debt has risen steadily, totaling more than 130% of GDP today.
Unemployment has remained persistently high, investment is plummeting, and the banking sector is deeply troubled.
Equally concerning, the number of women of child-bearing age has fallen by nearly two million since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
And the share of active workers with a university education remains at levels barely comparable with other advanced economies.
Given all of this, it should come as no shock that Italy and crisis-plagued Greece are the eurozone’s weakest performers in terms of per capita GDP growth over the last three years.
What is surprising is that Germany is the third-weakest performer.
Germany is fiscally sound, with a large accumulation of surplus savings.
It is also highly competitive in unit-labor-cost terms, enjoys its highest-ever labor participation rates, and benefits from a steady inflow of skilled labor from other parts of Europe.
But the fact is that Germany’s average annual per capita GDP growth of 0.51% since 2014 puts it far behind other core eurozone countries – namely, Austria, Belgium, Finland, and the Netherlands.
Even France, where per capita growth barely exceeds that of Italy, slightly outperforms Germany.
How is it possible that economies as different as Germany and Italy have such similar per capita growth performance?
To some extent, the explanation might seem obvious.
Germany is much closer to potential growth than Italy and even the United States, which struggled more than Germany to escape the Great Recession.
But the more recent recovery in other advanced countries should, if anything, have boosted potential growth in export-driven Germany.
Likewise, migration could affect per capita GDP growth.
Germany has received 2.7 million new residents, net of outflows, over the last five years, nearly a million of whom are refugees.
The latter provide an obvious Keynesian boost, but don’t add much to potential output.
Yet the migrant flows into Germany are not exactly anomalous.
The country had experienced similarly strong net inflows at other times in the last three decades, without such adverse effects on per capita GDP growth.
On the contrary, in many cases, migrants into Germany, particularly the young and skilled among them, have contributed to potential output.
The real culprit behind Germany’s low per capita GDP growth must be sought elsewhere.
According to the Bank for International Settlements, German banks’ claims on other eurozone countries – including Austria, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain – have fallen by over $200 billion, in aggregate, since the peak of the debt crisis in mid-2012.
Claims on Italy are down to pre-euro levels, and claims on Spain are nearing that benchmark.
Germany has even been disinvesting from core eurozone economies.
German banks’ quiet move toward disintegration contrasts sharply with the behavior of banks based in France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands, all of which have resumed European financial integration by stabilizing and often increasing their exposure in other countries.
These divergent trends, rather than generic capital flight, explain part of the growing imbalances in the Target 2 eurozone payment system.
Why are German banks the only ones backtracking on integration?
One possible reason is that domestic financial authorities, skeptical about the euro’s future, have instructed banks to cut their exposure to the rest of the eurozone.
Another is that German banks are experiencing a slow-burn malaise that European regulators have yet to recognize fully.
Their cost-base is, after all, the highest in the advanced world, yet their profitability is among the lowest, despite their negligible burden of bad loans.
Nonetheless, such skittishness is puzzling.
Around half of the German banking system is publicly owned, and thus enjoys an implicit government guarantee.
In fact, German banks received €239 billion ($253 billion) in state aid between 2009 and 2015.
In any case, German banks’ withdrawal from Europe cannot possibly be good for confidence, investment, or a dynamic service sector.
And, indeed, investment in Germany last year was more than five percentage points below its 1999 levels as a share of GDP, even though gross national savings have climbed to the highest levels since the International Monetary Fund data series began in 1980.
German officials usually explain away this huge drop by citing the parsimony of an aging society.
But demographic challenges – which are tomorrow’s constraints on potential output – should inspire reforms in entitlements and education, not suppression of today’s demand.
And that is where the real issue lies: no EU country, with the possible exception of France, has implemented so few reforms over the last decade as Germany.
That lack of reform is starting to show.
Wary banks and low investment must have played a role since 2012 in what looks like Germany’s slowest stretch of growth in total factor productivity in three decades.
Relying largely on exports – that is, other countries’ demand – may have distracted the German government from some of its own domestic responsibilities.
But it is in the interest of all of Europe – and Italy, in particular – that the continent’s largest economy become even stronger.
To be sure, the productivity slowdown is far from unique to Germany.
But unless Germany addresses the roots of that slowdown at home, it risks taking a huge hit, in the event that its currency is sharply revalued, in the form of lower exports and damage to its already-weak banking sector, resulting from deflation and negative long-term interest rates.
Italy’s illness is far more acute than Germany’s, but both are potentially serious.
Both are in need of immediate treatment.
The End of German Hegemony
BRUSSELS – Without anyone quite noticing, Europe’s internal balance of power has been shifting.
Germany’s dominant position, which has seemed absolute since the 2008 financial crisis, is gradually weakening – with far-reaching implications for the European Union.
Of course, from a soft-power perspective, the mere fact that people believe Germany is strong bolsters the country’s status and strategic position.
But it will not be long before people begin to notice that the main driver of that perception – that Germany’s economy continued to grow, while most other eurozone economies experienced a prolonged recession – represents an exceptional circumstance, one that will soon disappear.
In 12 of the last 20 years, Germany’s growth rate been lower than the average of the other three large eurozone countries (France, Italy, and Spain).
Although German growth surged ahead during the post-crisis period, as the graph shows, the International Monetary Fund predicts that it will fall back below that three-country average – and far below the eurozone average, which includes the smaller high-growth countries of Central and Eastern Europe – within five years.
To be sure, Germany still has some apparent advantages.
But a closer examination shows that they are not quite as positive as they seem.
For starters, Germany is close to full employment – in sharp contrast to the double-digit unemployment rates that prevail in much of the eurozone.
But the combination of full employment and low growth rates actually points to an underlying problem: very slow productivity growth.
Add to that a shrinking pool of workers capable of meeting the needs of Germany’s labor market – the country’s population is aging, and the arriving refugees lack the needed skills – and the German economy seems set for a protracted period of sluggish performance.
Another apparent advantage is Germany’s large financial reserves, which not only cushioned it from the crisis, but also conferred upon it considerable political sway.
Indeed, because German funds were indispensable in bailing out the eurozone’s deeply stressed periphery, the country became central to all efforts to address the crisis.
Germany’s consent was needed to create Europe’s “banking union,” which entailed the transfer of supervisory powers to the European Central Bank and the creation of a common fund to resolve failing banks.
And German resistance contributed to a delay in the ECB’s intervention in bond markets; when the ECB finally did launch its bond-buying program, it did so with Germany’s tacit approval.
But now that interest rates are at zero, Germany’s large savings are no longer doing it much good.
And with the financial storm having largely abated, Germany lacks new opportunities to demonstrate its political clout, both within and outside the eurozone.
Indeed, whereas Germany, owing to its deep involvement in Central and Eastern European economies, was a key player in the Minsk agreements that were meant to end the conflict in Ukraine, it has little influence in the Middle Eastern countries that are occupying the world’s attention today.
While many have highlighted Germany’s political leadership in the refugee crisis, the reality is that being thrust into the front line of that crisis, without having much influence over the factors that are driving it, is placing considerable strain on the country.
Germany is now, for the first time, in the position of having to ask its EU partners for solidarity, as it cannot absorb all the newcomers alone.
As usual, however, perceptions are lagging behind reality, which means that Germany is still widely viewed as the eurozone’s most powerful force.
But, as the global business cycle accelerates Germany’s return to the “old normal,” the power shift within Europe will become increasingly difficult to ignore.
Germany, which exports a large volume of investment goods, benefited more than other eurozone member countries from the investment boom in China and other emerging economies.
But emerging-economy growth is now slowing considerably, including in China, where demand is shifting from investment toward consumption.
This tends to undermine German growth and benefit southern European countries, which export more consumer goods.
The ongoing shift in Europe’s economic and political power dynamics is likely to have a major impact on the EU’s functioning – and especially that of the eurozone.
For example, without a strong Germany to enforce the eurozone’s fiscal strictures and urge the implementation of difficult but necessary structural reforms, countries may lose their motivation to do what is needed to ensure fairness and stability in the long term.
If inflation remains low, the ECB might feel freer to pursue further rounds of monetary stimulus, undermining fiscal objectives further.
In short, we may be headed toward a less “Germanic” economic policy in the eurozone.
While that might enhance the EU’s popularity in the periphery, it could increase resistance to EU membership in Germany – a country that, despite its waning economic strength, remains an important piece of the integration puzzle.
Germany’s Neighborhood Watch
FRANKFURT – On a recent trip to Germany, I was struck by two distinct narratives.
One narrative features a robust German economy with low unemployment, strong finances, and the right competitive position to exploit the most dynamic segments of global demand.
The other narrative describes an economy that is encumbered by never-ending European debt crises whose perpetrators seek to shift their responsibility – and their financing needs – onto Germany’s pristine balance sheet.
Both narratives are understandable.
But they cannot co-exist forever.
After all, it is difficult to be a good house in a deteriorating neighborhood.
Either the neighborhood improves, or the value of the house declines.
And it matters a great deal which narrative prevails – for Germany, for Europe, and for the global economy.
Germany today is reaping the benefits of many years of responsible domestic economic management.
In addition to maintaining sound public finances, German leaders implemented difficult structural reforms aimed at improving international competitiveness, including painful labor-market reforms.
As a result, Germany is one of the few advanced economies today that has created many jobs and maintained financial stability.
In other words, it is the AAA of AAAs.
Yet Germany is also part of a highly challenged neighborhood, if not its anchor.
Its neighbors include countries – most notably on the eurozone’s periphery – that are struggling.
They have high overall unemployment (and alarmingly high youth joblessness), and are unable to grow on their own power.
In some cases, they also face solvency questions, and are far from achieving the socio-political consensus needed to get their economic houses in order.
To state the obvious, this contrast between Germany and its neighborhood is very awkward.
It fuels endless internal and external tensions, encourages finger pointing, and promotes a loud and disruptive blame game.
And all of this distracts attention from the need to compete in a rapidly changing global economy.
The longer all of this persists, the more it tears at the fabric of European unity.
Accordingly, European officials need to continue to make steadfast progress in three major areas:
· Improve individual countries’ domestic policy mix in a manner that targets debt sustainability through both growth promotion and deficit reduction, especially in the most vulnerable peripheral economies;
· Enhance the eurozone’s internal financial circuit breakers to reduce the risk of disruptive financial feedback loops and destabilizing multiple equilibria; and
· Strengthen the eurozone’s institutional underpinnings, as well as its mechanisms for policy coordination and peer review.
None of these steps is easy; and they are certainly not automatic.
Moreover, to maximize their effectiveness, they must be implemented simultaneously; indeed, this is a situation in which one plus one plus one equals more than three.
And this will not happen unless two other, even more controversial steps are taken.
First, Germany must play an even larger role in conducting and coordinating the eurozone’s policy responses.
I know that many Germans are uncomfortable with this.
But there is no workable alternative for Europe’s well-being – and, therefore, that of Germany.
The European Union’s institutions still lack the authority and credibility needed to take on this role.
The European Central Bank does not possess the proper structural policy tools, and it has already been forced to bear burdens that, arguably, are beyond its strictly defined mandate.
And there is no other economy that comes close to Germany in size, influence, and economic and financial health.
Second, the eurozone, led by a Germany that is working closely with France, needs to clarify decisively what it intends to look like in the medium term.
There are two alternatives, both sensitive and controversial, and the choice is for Europeans alone to make and sustain; but they must make it if they are decisively to put behind them the risk of eurozone fragmentation.
On one hand, they can decide to let politics dominate economics.
This is not easy for politicians to sell, especially in the core countries (particularly Germany, Finland, and the Netherlands), as it would involve large multi-year subsidies to the periphery – or the analytical equivalent of the difficult decision made over 20 years ago to reunify Germany at a currency parity.
Here, however, there is the added difficulty of a potential conflict between regional politics and national democratic processes.
On the other hand, they can decide to allow economics to prevail. Here, eurozone members would collectively opt for a smaller and less imperfect union that includes countries with more similar initial conditions – economically, financially, politically, and socially.
And, again, there is no easy way to do this, especially given that the eurozone was intentionally designed with no exit in mind.
Until these difficult and controversial decisions are made, periods of relative tranquility in Europe are likely to be interrupted by the recurrent eruption of financial instability and bouts of political bickering and dithering.
And the longer this continues, the greater the risk that Germany’s neighborhood will erode the robustness of what the country has painstakingly built.
Ultimately, there can be no strong Germany without a stable eurozone; no stable eurozone without a strong Germany; and no global economic stability without both.
It is time for Europeans to make the difficult longer-term choices that are critical to sustaining and enhancing their historical regional project.
Germany’s Pathological Export Boom
Germany is the world’s industrial bazaar.
No other country can offer its international clients such a broad variety of industrial products.
Germany has 450 hidden world champions for niche products, and is home to 15 of the 20 biggest trade fairs in the world.
It is also the world’s top exporter of merchandise and the second-largest exporter of goods and services.
But Germany is gradually becoming a bazaar economy in a different sense, because nowadays it specializes in packaging and selling its products, while outsourcing an ever-larger share of its high value-added manufacturing to low-wage countries.
In other words, Germany’s role in the world economy is shifting from that of a producer to that of a merchant.
As a result, its exports contain an ever-increasing share of imported goods and services and the share of domestic value-added in its exports per unit of output is rapidly declining.
This does not mean that the German-made share of exports is falling in absolute terms.
It only means that the total volume of German exports has been rising faster than the total German value-added in those exports.
Is this good or bad?
A favorable assessment cannot rest on the fact that the overall German value-added in exports has been growing because this is simply an effect of the German specialization in export-related production.
When a country specializes in a certain area, capital and labor move into that area at a rate faster than they move into other areas – indeed, the growth of export-related sectors may come at the cost of a decline in other areas.
Simply put, there is such a thing as excessive specialization.
To assess whether excessive specialization has occurred in Germany, we must focus on the labor market, for it is here that the effect of specialization is most visible.
Unfortunately, there is no reason to be optimistic.
From 1995 to 2004, Germany lost a total of 1.09 million full-time equivalent jobs in manufacturing and trade.
At the same time, no new jobs were created in the rest of the economy.
On the contrary, employment outside manufacturing and trade declined, so that the economy as a whole suffered a net loss of 1.26 million full-time equivalent jobs.
In fact, since the fall of communism, the percentage decline in German industrial employment has been larger than in any other OECD country.
In part, this was due to the decline in the former East Germany.
But even western Germany holds the second-lowest rank of all developed countries.
The automobile and electrical engineering industries have been at the forefront of the bazaar economy.
To remain price competitive, they have had to rely on imported components.
The manufacture of electrical products, such as chips and passive devices, has quite often been shifted completely to Asia, while even automobiles that are still assembled in Germany rely heavily on components produced in Eastern Europe.
At bottom, the coincidence of unemployment and booming exports can be explained by the high and rigid wages from which Germany still suffers.
As a consequence of its welfare state and aggressive unions, Germany has had the highest hourly labor costs in the world for most of the last twenty years; only recently has Denmark taken the lead due to a revaluation of the krona.
Excessive wages destroy the labor-intensive upstream product stages too fast and also impairs other labor-intensive sectors like textiles, simple services, tourism, and construction.
As a result, these labor-intensive sectors must release a lot of labor and capital, which push into the capital-intensive export sectors that are better able to cope with high wages.
But, while these sectors therefore grow especially fast, their high capital intensity means that they cannot fully employ the released labor, with the result that some of the unemployed workers have nowhere to turn but the welfare state.
At the same time, since returns to capital are kept low by high wages, very little investment occurs.
The excess of savings over investment flows abroad as capital exports.
Economic growth and job creation slow, while exports soar.
Astonishingly, many interpret Germany’s export boom and current-account surplus, which measures these capital exports, as an indicator of the strength of Germany as an investment location.
But, according to the Bundesbank, net investment abroad (including financial investment) has already roughly matched domestic investment in recent years.
As the international division of labor proceeds further, the import content of German products will continue to increase, which means that rising exports will lead to fewer domestic jobs and less income growth.
Unless and until German workers accept the need for greater flexibility in the face of global competition, export profits will continue to be invested abroad, reducing overall production costs – and reinforcing the bazaar economy at home.
Germany’s Same Old Election
BERLIN – Germany’s current parliamentary election campaign looks like a front-running contender for the title of the most boring in the history of the Federal Republic.
The predominant response among commentators to the sole television debate between Chancellor Angela Merkel and her challenger, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, held two weeks before the election, was a collective yawn – all the more remarkable considering the historical events that overshadow this election.
Twenty years ago, the Berlin Wall came down, triggering a seismic shift that moved the borders of the old Federal Republic and of Western Europe as a whole, hundreds of miles to the east.
The vast Soviet empire exited the historical stage without a single shot being fired.
This anniversary should have provided ample reason for a heated debate about the successes and failures of German reunification and for offering a vision for Germany and Europe for the next 20 years.
Former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt once quipped that politicians who have a vision should go and have their eyes checked.
That warning made sense in the 1970’s, when even young parliamentarians in his Social Democratic Party dreamed of revolution.
But Schmidt would never have imagined that there would come a day when there would be no politician in search of a vision check.
Likewise, in the fall of 2008, the threat of financial Armageddon brought not just Germany but the whole world to the brink of disaster.
The worst has been mitigated and obscured in the wealthy countries by running up unprecedented levels of debt, but any moderately streetwise person knows that the next generation – and even the one after that – will be paying for the excesses of the investment bankers.
One cannot help but marvel at how discreetly this topic is being dealt with by Merkel and Steinmeier.
Ask the party strategists and they will tell you that the financial crisis is a topic for losers; voters want to hear something positive.
The electorate is experiencing the greatest slump since 1929 like a bad dream that is half over – and politicians don’t want to wake them up.
The so-called “autonomous” violent left-wing radicals in Berlin-Kreuzberg enjoy themselves by torching luxury cars, but not a single bank window has been smashed in Germany.
Nor has a single criminal financier-gambler, who misled the financial regulators with fudged figures, been brought to justice.
On the contrary, these bankrupts are filing lawsuits to get the million-dollar bonuses to which they feel entitled.
Quite a few of them are already back at the table gambling away with the taxpayer’s money and peddling their new “financial products”; they know that when the next crash comes, the taxpayer will have no choice but to bail them out again.
Only some stalwarts timidly point to the inflammatory question posed by Mack the Knife in Berthold Brecht’s Threepenny Opera: “What is a bank robbery compared to the founding of a bank?
What is a pick-lock compared to a debenture share?”
But this slogan is from the 1920’s and seems like a nostalgic reminder of past turmoil that one prefers to see on the stage.
The greatest miracle in the 2009 election campaign is the resurgence of the Liberal Democrats (FDP).
In fact, the German political landscape needs nothing more than a truly liberal party, in the US sense of the word “liberal” – a champion of the cause of individual freedom.
Unfortunately, under the far-too-long leadership of Guido Westerwelle, the FDP has degenerated into a party notable for defending the freedom only of a few privileged individuals: bankers and businessmen.
Just a year ago, the FDP fervently adhered to the religion of the American neo-cons, according to which markets regulate themselves. So it vigorously opposed all of the half-hearted attempts to regulate the financial sector.
As late as this past May, the FDP defended the ownership rights of US billionaire Christopher Flowers, a major stockholder in the failed German bank Hypo Real Estate, which was saved from oblivion by state guarantees worth more than €100 billion of taxpayers’ money.
Nevertheless, at a time when finance is under a cloud, the party that defends the freedom of the financial gamblers over the freedom of the individual is winning favor with the electorate like no other.
The FDP can count on about 13-14% of the vote, which means that it may be able to join with Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union to form a government.
I cannot explain this dynamic.
I do not believe in Karl Marx’s iron laws of history.
Yet one historical law does seem to apply: in an immense economic crisis, the voters stick with the people whose economic competence they have traditionally trusted – that is, the very people who led them to ruin.
But there is an exception to every rule.
In this case, it is the former PDS, the successor party to the former East Germany’s ruling party, the SED.
Dissidents in the GDR translated those three letters as “ P ractically t he S ame.”
This party, now using the presumptuous name “The Left,” has gained a foothold in West Germany with its impossible promises of higher pensions, a minimum hourly wage of €10, huge public investment schemes, and zero unemployment – in short, exactly the kind of socialist paradise that failed in East Germany.
And, of course, The Left, which still counts large numbers of former Stasi personnel among its members, also calls for a reassessment of East Germany itself; many party veterans object to the term “dictatorship” for this phase of their lives.
So, besides the FDP, this party, too, is profiting from the mainstream political parties’ half-hearted handling of the global economic crisis.
The only “winner” when Germans vote on September 27 will most likely be the “party” of non-voters.
I do not sympathize with this group, but I do understand that non-voters expect only one thing of Germany’s political parties these days: “practically the same”
Germany’s Socialism of Fools
BERLIN – If opinion polls counted as elections, large parts of Germany would already be governed by the far right.
In several eastern German states, the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) has established itself as the strongest political force.
Almost everywhere else in the country, the party currently ranks second – on par or just ahead of the struggling Social Democrats (SPD) and behind only Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU).
In coming weeks, matters could get even worse.
In regional elections in Bavaria on October 14 and in Hesse two weeks later, the AfD is poised to enter the two last remaining regional parliaments without far-right representation.
Concerns about immigration continue to fuel this surge.
In the eastern city of Chemnitz, recent anti-foreigner riots and pro-tolerance rallies provided a stark reminder of how divided the German public remains on migration.
But it would be a dangerous miscalculation to regard the AfD as a xenophobic, single-issue party.
The AfD has always been a political chameleon, cleverly exploiting mismanaged issues.
This arc of anger began during the euro crisis, proceeded to migration after the summer of 2015, and most recently discovered integration and Islam as wedge issues to boost support.
With each turn, the party widened its appeal.
Now, it seems to have another target in its sights: liberal economics and a vulgar ethno-socialism.
This turn to “social justice” issues is counterintuitive.
The AfD was born in 2013 as a euro-critical “party of professors,” many of them economic liberals, and neoliberalism remains part of their offspring’s DNA.
To this day, the party’s official statements promote free trade, increased competition, a lower tax rate, and austerity in southern Europe.
But what worked for the one-time professors’ party is unlikely to pave the AfD’s path to power.
For many blue-collar voters, particularly in eastern Germany, neoliberalism is a non-starter.
Recognizing this, the AfD leadership has recently started to shed the pro-business baptism gown that the party has long outgrown.
The goal is to establish the AfD as a new mass party, or Volkspartei, which could prove a mortal threat to what is left of the SPD, as well as to Germany’s wider political system.
In Bavaria and Hesse, the AfD’s campaign already reflects this change.
Calling for higher pensions and improved medical services in rural areas, and criticizing high rents, the party aims to “be social without turning red,” as one campaign slogan puts it.
And the AfD leader in Brandenburg, Andreas Kalbitz, recently announced that the party plans to focus on “social justice” in upcoming elections in three eastern German states next year.
The driving forces behind a more “socialist” AfD can be found in Germany’s east, where firebrand party leaders like Björn Höcke of Thuringia have long called for “a party of patriotism and solidarity.”
For many, that is a thinly veiled bow to National Socialism.
Höcke and Jürgen Pohl, an AfD Bundestag member, recently put forward some of the program’s key ingredients, which include higher pensions and inclusion of the self-employed in the state-run pension funds – policies that would focus on ethnic Germans.
The AfD will hold a special party convention early next year to formalize programmatic changes and establish a unified position on social issues.
The explicit aim, according to Höcke, is to combine “identity and solidarity” in order to reject “neoliberalism and its history of failure.”
While a heated internal debate can be expected, the Höcke wing currently seems to have the wind at its back.
At the federal level, an AfD majority is highly unlikely as long as the German economy is booming.
But a much stronger far right is a near-certainty.
Combining anti-establishment rhetoric on cultural and economic issues has worked remarkably well for right-wing populist parties elsewhere, and the question for many German observers is not whether this formula will work in Germany, but how well.
The polls are not reassuring.
A study presented last week by the Bertelsmann Foundation, an independent think tank, stresses that issues such as income distribution or affordable housing can effectively act as “bridges” between the extreme right and voters at the political center.
Up to 30.4% of German voters are open to AfD positions, according to the study.
In view of this potential, much will depend on how Germany’s center responds.
One idea is that a division of labor between the CDU and the SPD could diffuse the current challenge.
The CDU could recapture AfD voters by strengthening its conservative positions on cultural and identity questions.
The SPD, by contrast, would move to the left on social and economic issues, stressing equality, solidarity, and justice, and thus closing the ideological gap that is empowering the AfD.
But this will be difficult to do for the CDU and the SPD.
Locked in an unpopular grand coalition, such an ideological realignment would make finding common ground in the government increasingly challenging and could well result in an early federal election.
And such an outcome would only further strengthen the AfD.
German Banks on Top
CHICAGO – Overcoming the European Union’s current economic malaise, as almost everyone acknowledges, requires deeper integration, with the first step taking the form of a banking union supervised by the European Central Bank.
But Europe’s banking union also requires uniform rules for winding up insolvent financial institutions – and this has become a sticking point.
Germany opposes the new bank-resolution mechanism proposed by the European Commission, generating moral and political support at home by portraying its stance as an effort to protect German taxpayers: Why should the German ants pay for the southern European grasshoppers?
In fact, Germany’s position is a ploy to hide its anticompetitive behavior, whereby the government subsidizes German banks and industry at the expense of everyone else – including German taxpayers.
Europe’s common market has been the single greatest success of post-World War II European policy, boosting economic growth and fostering cultural interchange.
But a common market requires a level playing field, and the European Commission has worked hard to achieve this in many sectors over the years.
Until now, the main exception was banking.
The emerging banking union is not only the first step toward a European fiscal union; it is also the final step toward completing the European common market.
Without a common resolution mechanism that levels the playing field, the common market will remain unfinished.
In principle, the EU’s banking rules are common to all member states.
In practice, their implementation was, until recently, left to national regulators, who applied very different standards.
Most important, while state subsidies in all other sectors are forbidden, they are commonly accepted in banking – not only explicit subsidies, such as Germany’s bailout of several Landesbanks after the American subprime-mortgage crisis, but implicit subsidies as well.
Some French banks’ traders openly boast of backing by the French government, which will never let its banks fail.
Unfortunately, this is not just a French or a German problem.
All market players know that EU governments will not let big banks fail.
This implicit subsidy not only costs each country’s taxpayers billions of euros; it also distorts competition, because not all implicit subsidies are created equal.
Regardless of its fundamentals, a German bank would be considered safer than an Italian one, because the German government’s implicit guarantee is much more valuable than the Italian government’s.
As a result, German banks have a lower cost of funding and – all else being equal – higher profitability.
To the extent that some of the lower cost is rebated to their clients, even industrial firms in Germany enjoy a lower cost of capital, giving them an unfair advantage vis-à-vis their European competitors.
One way to prevent this distortion would be to create a mechanism to bail out all banks with European money.
But this approach would not only leave German taxpayers on the hook; it would also create perverse incentives in the entire European banking system, maximizing instability.
The preferred alternative is to create a common resolution mechanism, which would apply throughout Europe, regardless of a bank’s country of origin.
Such a mechanism would prevent the need for government intervention.
The recent proposal by Michel Barnier, the European Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services, is an effort to implement this solution.
It provides a common resolution mechanism for all banks in Europe, which forces losses to be absorbed by shareholders, bondholders, and large depositors before any government money is committed.
To provide short-term financing to a bank during any restructuring, the Commission’s plan would create a European Fund, putting all banks on an equal footing.
The Commission’s proposal is far from perfect.
After a bank’s shareholders are wiped out and its creditors take an 8% “haircut,” the European Fund transforms itself into a bailout fund, justifying some of Germany’s fears.
And there is no explicit prohibition of some form of national government bailout.
Even so, the proposal is a step in the right direction.
German criticism should be directed at improving it, not at sandbagging it.
German taxpayers have paid dearly for German banks’ mistakes.
In 2008, when the Landesbanks were found to be full of American subprime mortgages, the German government bailed them out with a €500 billion ($650 billion) rescue package at its taxpayers’ expense.
In 2010, when German banks were badly over-exposed – to the tune of $704 billion – to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, European taxpayers and the ECB helped them to bring most of that money home.
The biggest threat to German taxpayers is not southern European profligacy, but their own country’s banks.
In this sense, the banking union is not a scheme to burden German taxpayers with the losses of failed southern European banks; rather, it is a mechanism to render all banks (including German ones) accountable for their own mistakes, thereby reducing the burden that they impose on domestic taxpayers.
It is about time that German voters understood that the largest grasshoppers are in the center of their own towns.
Germany’s Zero Hour
The 8th of May always brings back memories of 1945, because for me the end of the war in Europe really was a zero hour.
When the first Soviet soldiers came up our little street in the Western suburbs of Berlin, we knew that the great slaughter was coming to an end.
My father who had been in the resistance would come back from Brandenburg prison.
I no longer needed to hide as I had done after my release from a Gestapo camp at the beginning of February.
Somehow a new life would begin.
First, however, was the chaos.
The Nazis were gone, and the occupation powers had not yet set up any kind of administration.
We all went looting the local shops; I still have the slim volumes of romantic poetry which my 16-year-old self took from a bookshop.
The occupation troops went on a rampage. Food was hard to find.
My father was taken from prison and transported straight to central Berlin, where he was told to set up the office for Berlin’s energy supply, a task that had to be done literally from nothing.
There was no power, no transport, no organised life of any kind for a period.
Was it defeat or liberation?
For Germans this question was not easily answered, though clearly our family was liberated in every sense.
The question then was this: liberated for what?
Where do we go from here?
“You must help,” my mother said to me.
So I offered my services to the local Soviet authority and helped distribute basic foodstuffs to a small number of outlets in our district of Zehlendorf.
Five weeks later, however, I was back at school.
I carried a special pass as a “victim of fascism,” but others showed their Iron Cross which they had got for late military action.
Some were refugees from the East, many had their homes destroyed in air raids, almost all grieved for lost loved ones.
Yet the zero hour did not last.
It is almost unbelievable, but three years later the liberalising policies that followed a currency reform set in motion what came to be known as Germany’s economic miracle.
To be precise: this is how West Germany’s economic miracle began.
The German example shows just how different occupation powers can be.
In the Soviet zone of occupation, progress was slow and above all coupled with a new enslavement.
Even concentration camps like Buchenwald changed their guards and inmates but remained in use.
The Western powers in Germany, on the other hand, pursued, after a short period of non-fraternisation, a policy of controlled empowerment.
Within a year of the end of the war there were indigenous administrations, within two years elections.
Democracy was not just preached but practised, and it could build on German traditions.
All this, to be sure, was not just benevolence on the part of the occupying powers. It was also a result of the incipient Cold War, and the desire of both sides to consolidate “their” part of Germany.
Even so, there are lessons to be learned from the process.
Two of these deserve to be mentioned.
One is economic and has to do with the Marshall Plan.
It is perhaps regrettable but nonetheless real that democracy finds roots more easily if economic conditions improve.
Such improvement requires above all self-help, the actions of individuals who will not accept the misery of the zero hour for long.
Such self-help can be encouraged by policies (which is what Ludwig Erhard, the father of the “social market economy” did in Germany), but some starting capital helps.
This is where the Marshall Plan of American support became crucial.
Similarly, the European Union has helped, and continues to help the postcommunist countries on their way.
The other lesson is moral, and it is more difficult.
The Nuremberg trials exposed the guilt of the Nazi leaders beyond doubt, if indeed any such doubt was left in people’s minds.
While these were important, however, Germany did not begin its arduous path away from zero hour with concern for the past.
Indeed, the Adenauer years after 1949 were described by many as years of “restoration” because too many minor Nazi figures had remained in their jobs.
In some ways, the country simply ignored their past and moved forward.
Years later when a market economy and political democracy were established, Germany did turn toward “coping with the past”, and did so very effectively.
Germany’s Nazi past is uniquely horrible, so comparisons with other countries with blighted histories are misleading.
Still, in its own way Poland has followed a similar path after 1989: first the new, then the attempt to come to terms with the past.
On balance this is a better method of dealing with a nation’s zero hour than doing things the other way round.
In Europe then, the 8th of May 2005 is an occasion to look back in sorrow and anger. It is also an occasion to look forward with pride in the achievements of recent decades and therefore for hope.
Germany’s Misunderstood Trade Surplus
BERLIN – Now that Germany’s current-account surplus has reached a record €270 billion ($285 billion), or close to 8.7% of GDP, the ongoing debate about its economic model has intensified.
Eurozone politicians and Donald Trump’s administration in the United States are each blaming the other for the economic imbalance; and all are blaming the euro.
Trump’s administration, for its part, has attacked Germany for exporting too much, and accused it of manipulating the euro.
In fact, Germany’s trade surplus has little to do with the euro; which has become a convenient scapegoat – a stand-in for other policy mistakes.
Many Germans view the latest wave of criticism as a sign that others are merely envious of their country’s success, and they have angrily refuted arguments that Germany has tried to gain an unfair competitive advantage.
Germany, they point out, does not engage in price dumping or direct export promotion, and its leaders do not target the euro.
On the contrary, prior to adopting the common currency, Germany had for decades pursued a strong-Deutsche Mark policy, because it wanted to encourage domestic exporters to maintain competitiveness through innovation, rather than reliance on the exchange rate.
This was the central feature of Germany’s economic model after World War II, and the main reason its long Wirtschaftswunder (“economic miracle”) could be sustained.
The criticism of Germany’s trade surplus suffers from three fallacies.
For starters, many of the critics seem to believe that Germany’s trade balance can be systematically manipulated with the exchange rate.
But, owing to the integration of global value chains, industrial exports now comprise many imported inputs, which means that the effect of exchange-rate movements on domestic prices and the trade balance has decreased substantially over time.
In fact, Germany’s bilateral trade surplus with the US has barely changed, despite substantial swings in the euro-dollar exchange rate – which was as high as €1:$1.60 in 2011, and as low as €1:$1.04 more recently.
Germany owes its export success not to currency manipulation, but to its strong market position and the pricing power of its highly specialized manufacturing champions.
A second fallacy is the belief that politicians and central banks can actually set exchange rates.
In most advanced economies, the exchange rate cannot simply be decreed; rather, it is endogenously determined by the underlying real economy and the state of the financial system.
Currency markets are too deep for direct intervention to be worth the risk, as the Swiss National Bank discovered a few years ago when it tried to stem the franc’s appreciation.
The US Treasury abandoned currency-market interventions in the 1990s; and the European Central Bank has tried to intervene only once, very briefly in 2000.
Accusations that the US Federal Reserve and the ECB have pursued unconventional policy measures to weaken their respective currencies miss the fact that exchange-rate movements have only a limited, short-lived effect on domestic inflation, exports, and growth.
Both central banks are guided by their mandates, not by an implicit or explicit exchange-rate objective.
A third fallacy – which one often encounters on the German side of the debate – is the belief that a country’s current-account balance reflects the competitiveness of its exports.
In reality, a country’s external balance is determined by its preferences and its intertemporal saving and investment decisions.
Fundamentals such as Germany’s demographics alone probably account for only about three percentage points – or one-third – of its current-account surplus.
As these three fallacies show, the debate over Germany’s external surplus should not be about the euro exchange rate or German exports.
The euro is not too weak, and German exports are not too high.
Rather, the problem is that Germany’s imports are too low, owing to its huge investment gap.
Germany has one of the lowest public-investment rates in the industrialized world.
Its municipalities, which are responsible for half of all public investment, currently have unrealized investment projects worth €136 billion, or 4.5% of GDP; Germany’s school buildings alone need another €35 billion for repairs.
Meanwhile, private investment in Germany’s aging capital stock has been weakened by many German companies’ desire to invest abroad.
The gap is the result of policy failures – namely protectionist policies in the non-tradable services sector.
The International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, and the OECD have long tried to convince Germany to deregulate services, curtail vested interests, and improve competition.
But, as it stands, wages, productivity, and investment remain high in the German export sector, and low in the non-tradable services sector.
The international debate about Germany’s current account should thus focus on measures to liberalize the country’s services and remove other barriers to investment.
To that end, Germany should improve its digital and transportation infrastructure; strengthen market mechanisms to encourage more renewable-energy development; address its shortage of skilled labor; change its tax system to strengthen incentives to invest; and reform its regulations to reduce uncertainty.
Germany is an increasingly important political and economic power in Europe and on the world stage.
But, until now, the debate about Germany’s current-account surplus has been counterproductive.
Criticism of Germany’s export prowess, and accusations of currency manipulation, are just as wrong-headed as Germany’s own defense of its excessive surplus.
Ultimately, Germany can serve everyone’s best interests – including its own – by reducing its surplus, and thus the harmful economic imbalances that lie just beneath the surface.
Schäuble’s Gathering Storm
ATHENS – Europe’s crisis is poised to enter its most dangerous phase.
After forcing Greece to accept another “extend-and-pretend” bailout agreement, fresh battle lines are being drawn.
And, with the refugee influx exposing the damage caused by divergent economic prospects and sky-high youth unemployment in Europe’s periphery, the ramifications are ominous, as recent statements by three European politicians – Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron, and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble – have made clear.
Renzi has come close to demolishing, at least rhetorically, the fiscal rules that Germany has defended for so long.
In a remarkable act of defiance, he threatened that if the European Commission rejected Italy’s national budget, he would re-submit it without change.
This was not the first time Renzi had alienated Germany’s leaders.
And it was no accident that his statement followed a months-long effort by his own finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, to demonstrate Italy’s commitment to the eurozone’s German-backed “rules.”
Renzi understands that adherence to German-inspired parsimony is leading Italy’s economy and public finances into deeper stagnation, accompanied by further deterioration of the debt-to-GDP ratio.
A consummate politician, Renzi knows that this is a short path to electoral disaster.
Macron is very different from Renzi in both style and substance.
A banker-turned-politician, he is President François Hollande’s only minister who combines a serious understanding of France’s and Europe’s macroeconomic challenges with a reputation in Germany as a reformer and skillful interlocutor.
So when he speaks of an impending religious war in Europe, between the Calvinist German-dominated northeast and the largely Catholic periphery, it is time to take notice.
Schäuble’s recent statements about the European economy’s current trajectory similarly highlight Europe’s cul-de-sac.
For years, Schäuble has played a long game to realize his vision of the optimal architecture Europe can achieve within the political and cultural constraints that he takes as given.
The “Schäuble plan,” as I have dubbed it, calls for a limited political union to support the euro.
In brief, Schäuble favors a formalized Eurogroup (composed of the eurozone’s finance ministers), presided over by a president who wields veto power – legitimized by a Euro Chamber comprising parliamentarians from the eurozone member states – over national budgets.
In exchange for forfeiting control over their budgets, Schäuble offers France and Italy – the primary targets of his plan – the promise of a small eurozone-wide common budget that would partly fund unemployment and deposit-insurance schemes.
Such a disciplinarian, minimalist political union does not go down well in France, where elites have always resisted forfeiting sovereignty.
While politicians like Macron have moved a long way toward accepting the need to transfer powers over national budgets to the “center,” they fear that Schäuble’s plan asks too much and offers too little: severe limits on France’s fiscal space and a macroeconomically insignificant common budget.
But even if Macron could persuade Hollande to accept Schäuble’s plan, it is not clear whether German Chancellor Angela Merkel would consent to it.
Schäuble’s ideas have so far failed to persuade her or, indeed, the Bundesbank (which, through its president, Jens Weidmann, has been hugely negative toward any degree of fiscal mutualization, even the limited version that Schäuble is willing to trade for control over the French and Italian budgets).
Caught between a reluctant German chancellor and an indisposed France, Schäuble imagined that the turbulence caused by a Greek exit from the eurozone would help persuade the French, as well as his cabinet colleagues, of his plan’s necessity.
Now, while waiting for the current Greek “program” to collapse under the weight of its inherent contradictions, Germany’s finance ministry is preparing for the battles ahead.
In September, Schäuble distributed to his Eurogroup colleagues an outline of three proposals for preventing a new euro crisis.
First, eurozone government bonds should include clauses that make it easy to “bail in” bondholders.
Second, the European Central Bank’s rules ought to be altered to prevent commercial banks from counting such bonds as ultra-safe, liquid assets.
And, third, Europe should ditch the idea of common deposit insurance, replacing it with a commitment to let banks fail when they no longer fulfill the ECB’s collateral rules.
Implementing these proposals in, say, 1999, might have limited the gush of capital to the periphery immediately following the single currency’s introduction.
Alas, in 2015, given the eurozone members’ legacy public debts and banking losses, such a scheme would cause a deeper recession in the periphery and almost certainly lead to the monetary union’s breakup.
Exasperated by Schäuble’s backtracking from his own plan for political union, Macron recently vented his frustration: “The Calvinists want to make others pay until the end of their life,” he complained.
“They want reforms with no contributions toward any solidarity.”
The most troubling aspect of Renzi’s and Macron’s statements is the hopelessness they convey.
Renzi’s defiance of fiscal rules that push Italy further into an avoidable debt-deflationary spiral is understandable; but, in the absence of proposals for alternative rules, it leads nowhere.
Macron’s difficulty is that there seems to be no set of painful reforms that he can offer Schäuble to persuade the German government to accept the degree of surplus recycling necessary to stabilize France and the eurozone.
Meanwhile, Germany’s commitment to “rules” that are incompatible with the eurozone’s survival undermines those French and Italian politicians who were, until recently, hoping for an alliance with Europe’s largest economy.
Some, like Renzi, respond with acts of blind rebellion.
Others, like Macron, are beginning gloomily to accept that the eurozone’s current institutional framework and policy mix will ultimately lead either to a formal breakup or to a death by a thousand cuts, in the form of continued economic divergence.
The silver lining in the gathering storm cloud is that minimalist proposals for political union, like Schäuble’s plan, are losing ground.
Nothing short of macroeconomically significant institutional reforms will stabilize Europe. And only a pan-European democratic alliance of citizens can generate the groundswell needed for such reforms to take root.
Germany’s Golden Opportunity
BERLIN – The German economy appears unstoppable.
Output is expected to grow by more than 2% this year, and wages by 3%, with the current-account surplus set to reach a towering 8.4% of GDP.
Unemployment has been halved over the last decade, and now stands at an all-time low.
German exporters remain highly innovative and competitive.
And the government is recording a sizeable budget surplus.
While the rest of Europe remains mired in crisis and self-doubt, Germany’s future seems bright and secure.
But appearances can be deceiving.
In fact, today’s rosy macroeconomic data tell only part of the story.
Since the euro was established in 1999, Germany’s productivity growth has been no more than average among European countries, real wages have declined for half the workforce, and annual GDP growth has averaged a disappointing 1.2%.
A key reason for this lackluster performance is Germany’s notoriously paltry investment rate, which is among the lowest in the OECD.
The result is deteriorating infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and schools.
This, together with an inadequate regulatory and business environment, has raised concerns among companies; since 1999, the largest German multinationals have doubled their employee headcounts abroad, while cutting jobs at home.
In their 2013 coalition agreement, the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democrats set a goal of raising public and private investment by 3% of GDP, or €90 billion ($100.8 billion) annually, to reach the OECD average.
Although this is not a particularly ambitious objective – after all, Germany’s current-account surplus at the time amounted to 7.8% GDP – achieving it is vital to the country’s continued prosperity.
Last August, the German government appointed a 21-member committee of experts (including the three authors) from business, labor unions, finance, and academia to determine how to achieve the target.
Last month, the committee presented its ten-point action plan, which, despite disagreement on taxes and private financing of public investment, reflects an unusually broad consensus.
For starters, the action plan calls for limiting the impact on public investment of the pressure to consolidate the government budget.
The plan does not challenge the constitutional debt brake that forbids the federal government from running structural deficits above 0.35% of GDP.
But it does recommend a legally binding commitment to keep investment levels at least as high as the rate of depreciation of state assets, and to use unexpected budget surpluses, first and foremost, for increased public investment.
In order to support local investment, the expert committee proposes creating a “national investment pact” to enable municipalities to increase investment by at least €15 billion over the next three years.
And it recommends establishing a public advisory institution to help municipalities realize their investment projects, of which there is currently a €118 billion backlog.
The most controversial issue, within the committee and in Germany, relates to financing infrastructure via public-private partnerships, a seemingly promising solution that nonetheless has proved to be far from a panacea.
To strike an effective balance, the action plan proposes two publicly owned investment funds – one raising money from institutional investors, and the other from individuals.
The public projects financed by the funds would provide sufficient efficiency gains to attract private financing.
As for purely private-sector investment, the committee recommends a focus on developing the sectors that will dominate tomorrow’s economy.
As it stands, Germany is strong in traditional industrial sectors, but has fallen behind its competitors in Asia and the United States in terms of investment in research and development.
To catch up, R&D spending should be raised from less than 3% to at least 3.5% of GDP.
Nowhere is the need to overcome financing bottlenecks more apparent than with Germany’s Energiewende (energy transition).
To succeed, more than €30 billion, or 1% of GDP, will have to be invested annually in network infrastructure, renewable-energy generation, combined heat and power systems, and storage technologies in the coming decades.
While some of these funds will come from public budgets, the vast majority will have to be provided by the private sector.
Moreover, bringing Germany’s digital infrastructure, especially its broadband networks, up to international standards will require significant investment, which an improved regulatory framework could help to encourage.
Regulatory reform is also needed to strengthen support for startup companies – an area in which Germany is notoriously weak, reflected in the difficulties such companies face in obtaining venture capital.
A substantial increase in private investment is necessary not just for Germany; it is critical to Europe’s recovery from its ongoing crisis.
Given Germany’s relative economic strength, it has a special responsibility to help foster investment throughout Europe, including by promoting European-level reforms of transport and energy, supporting incentives for innovation, and backing digital modernization.
The expert committee supports EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s plan to channel some €300 billion of private-sector money toward infrastructure, and proposes that if the scheme is successful, it should be transformed into a permanent European investment mechanism.
This would require more funding in the long run for the European Fund for Strategic Investments, to which the German government should contribute directly.
Germany’s combination of strong growth, low unemployment, favorable financing conditions, and large budget surpluses present it with a golden opportunity.
With increased investment in infrastructure, not to mention a competitive education system and more investment-friendly business conditions, it can place its economy on a stronger footing for the future, and help pull Europe out of its malaise.
We now have a plan; all that is needed is the will to implement it.
Germany’s Four Neins
BERLIN – Germany’s stance toward Europe has become one of rejection and disengagement.
Its policymakers deny the eurozone’s crisis-ridden countries a more active fiscal policy; refuse to support a European investment agenda to generate demand and growth; have declared a fiscal surplus, rather than faster potential growth, as their primary domestic goal; and have begun turning against the European Central Bank (ECB) in the struggle against deflation and a credit crunch.
On all four counts, Germany is wrong.
To be sure, Germany is justified in rejecting narrow-minded calls by France and Italy for unconditional fiscal expansion.
After all, fiscal stimulus can work only if it supports private investment and is accompanied by much more ambitious structural reforms – the kind of reforms that France and Italy are currently resisting.
But Germany has all of the leverage it needs to implement the stability-oriented reforms that it wants for Europe.
For starters, Germany, together with the European Commission, can compel France to pursue deeper reforms in exchange for more time to consolidate its deficit.
Germany cannot, however, indulge its obsession with supply-side reforms without also pursuing growth-enhancing policies.
As Germany knows from its own experience in the early 2000s, the benefits of supply-side reforms – namely, improved competitiveness and higher long-term growth rates – take a long time to emerge.
Time is a luxury that Europe does not have.
With every month that the economy loses productive capacity, the likelihood of stagnation and deflation rises.
The key to ending the European crisis is a stimulus plan that addresses deficiencies on both the supply and demand sides.
That is why Germany’s refusal to help find a way to finance the proposed European investment agenda – which, for a limited time, would fund productive private investment – is a mistake.
Equally problematic is Germany’s focus on maintaining a fiscal surplus.
With projections for German GDP growth this year and next revised downward by more than 0.6 percentage points in the last few months, the government could be forced to initiate a pro-cyclical fiscal policy to achieve its goal, inducing even lower growth at home and throughout the eurozone.
Given that the German economy’s output gap remains negative, the government should be implementing expansionary fiscal policy that targets the country’s infrastructure weaknesses.
In this sense, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble’s plan to spend an additional €10 billion ($12.5 billion) on public investment in 2016-2018 is a step in the right direction.
But, at just 0.1% of Germany’s annual GDP, Schäuble’s scheme looks more like an attempt to quiet criticism from the rest of Europe than a genuine policy shift.
Germany’s fourth policy mistake is its apparent withdrawal of support for the ECB.
Over the last seven years, the ECB’s actions have helped Germany’s economy and taxpayers as much as those of its neighbors.
Moreover, the claim that the ECB’s purchases of asset-backed securities amount to “toxic loans” that transfer risk to German taxpayers is unfounded; after all, there have been almost no defaults since 2008.
Germany’s leaders need to recognize this – and to defend the ECB publicly from baseless fear mongering.
Failure to do so may reflect an effort to forestall the rise of the far-right anti-European political forces, particularly the Alternative for Germany.
But this strategy merely plays into the party’s hands.
If Germany refuses to take a more reasoned approach, it risks undermining the ECB’s credibility, thereby reducing the effectiveness of its measures.
If that happens, the ECB may well be compelled to initiate large-scale purchases of eurozone government bonds through its so-called “outright monetary transactions” scheme – a plan that many German policymakers and economists staunchly oppose.
The German government can use its considerable leverage to compel France and Italy to pursue the structural reforms that both countries need, while allowing a growth-friendly demand stimulus to lift the threat of deflation hanging over the eurozone.
And it has the authority to bolster the ECB’s credibility and thus its efforts to ensure future price stability and prevent financial contagion.
Europe needs a grand bargain, involving close coordination on structural reforms and fiscal and monetary policy.
Germany’s relative economic and political stability, far from enabling it to disengage from such efforts, makes it among the most important protagonists in their development and implementation.
The question is whether Germany’s leaders will recognize this before Europe’s economy falls into an even deeper slump.
Getting Bank Culture Right
WASHINGTON, DC – Banks and banking rely on trust.
But while trust takes years to establish, it can be squandered abruptly if a particular bank’s ethics are weak, its values poor, and its behavior simply wrong.
The events that triggered the 2008 global financial crisis, together with the subsequent scandals that have emerged – from the rigging of the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) to sanctions-busting and money-laundering – amount to a catalog of cultural failures within our financial institutions.
Yes, extensive measures have been taken since the crisis to strengthen the financial system.
But a profound weakness remains: To be blunt, it concerns the risk-taking culture that still prevails within some departments of global banks and in the financial system itself.
Too often, bank bosses’ promises to change the “corporate culture” and ensure their employees’ good conduct have not been matched by fully effective implementation.
In too many cases, banks are still failing to fulfill their obligations in serving their communities and the public at large.
It is true that the banking sector is paying a high price for its misdeeds: fines, litigation, and regulatory tightening have cost approximately $300 billion so far.
But the tax-paying public – innocent of any wrongdoing – has also had to bear costs, both direct and indirect.
And, while a handful of “rogue traders” (and, most recently, one Libor manipulator) have ended up in prison, it would be overly optimistic to conclude that the punishment has been sufficient to transform bank culture.
If banks and other financial institutions are to perform their crucial role in providing support for growth and employment, it is imperative that they take steps to regain the public’s trust.
But how?
More regulation is not necessarily the best path forward: The rules and norms that define a “right” and “wrong” culture are beyond the wit of regulators and supervisory bodies.
But the pressure to devise such rules is bound to mount if banks do not demonstrate that they are grappling effectively with the challenge of cultural change.
Sadly, until now, many banks have adopted an unconvincing piecemeal approach.
It is not enough to strengthen legal compliance.
A new report published by the Group of Thirty argues that banks must do far more.
Real change must go to the core of an institution’s day-to-day operations.
Banks must change compensation practices that reward excessive risk; protect whistleblowers; recruit and train staff to reflect proper ethics; and ensure that their boards of directors play a more active oversight role.
(I believe that if boards had been aware of the egregious behavior being perpetrated within some institutions, from product mis-selling to price-fixing, they would have acted to stop it.)
Let me be clear: Setting values and shaping an organizational culture take a long time and a great deal of work.
Successful reform requires changing people’s mindset and habituating them to self-regulation.
A written code – emphasizing the commercial benefits of ethical business conduct, and the negative consequences of falling short – is part of that effort and may help preserve and strengthen a culture; but a code alone is not enough.
Constant reminders and repetition are essential.
Employees must understand instinctively what may be done and what should never be done.
They must internalize a culture that values strict adherence to high ethical standards of conduct.
To that end, banks should make their values and culture integral to their hiring, firing, and promotion decisions.
Indeed, the values and conduct of a bank’s risk-takers should account for 50% of their annual performance review.
Failing to live up to a bank’s desired cultural norms should have an impact on an employee’s career – and, when necessary, end it.
Banking regulators and supervisors also have a decisive role to play.
They need to work with boards and senior management to ensure that major reforms are implemented and then consistently applied.
Regular exchanges of views between oversight officials and the banks should be regarded as a crucial component of this process.
Central bankers have been dismayed by many banks’ failure to move forward decisively to address the difficult internal issues of conduct and culture.
And now the concerns have grown to the point that delay is no longer an option.
Either the banks reform themselves, or public authorities will intervene still further.
Getting Corruption Right
NEW YORK – I just returned from India, where I was lecturing to the Indian Parliament in the same hall where US President Barack Obama had recently spoken.
The country was racked by scandal. A gigantic, ministerial-level scam in the mobile-telephone sector had siphoned off many billions of dollars to a corrupt politician.
But several of the MPs had also been taken aback on discovering that when Obama spoke to them, he read from an “invisible” teleprompter.
This had misled his audience into thinking that he was speaking extemporaneously, a skill that is highly regarded in India.
Both episodes were seen as a form of corruption: one involved money, the other deception.
The two transgressions are obviously not equal in moral turpitude.
But the Obama episode illustrates an important cross-cultural difference in assessing how corrupt a society is.
Transparency International and occasionally the World Bank like to rank countries by their degree of corruption, with the media then ceaselessly citing where each country stands.
But cultural differences between countries undermine the legitimacy of such rankings – which are, after all, based on surveys of the public.
What Obama was doing was a common enough practice in the United States (though one might expect better from an orator of his ability); it was not so in India, where such a technique is, indeed, regarded as reprehensible.
India certainly has corruption, like almost every other country.
But India also has a culture in which people commonly assume that everyone in public life is corrupt unless they prove otherwise.
Even a blind man will tell Transparency International: “I saw him take a bribe with my own eyes.”
Indeed, a distinguished Indian bureaucrat, a man of unimpeachable character, once told me that his mother had told him: “I believe you are not corrupt only because you are my son!”
So, if you ask Indians whether their governance is marked by widespread corruption, they will answer with gusto: yes!
But their exuberance biases India’s global ranking relative to more empirically minded countries.
A similar bias arises from the occasional tendency to view political patronage elsewhere as being more corrupt than the same practices at home.
For example, when the East Asian financial crisis broke out, there followed a systematic attempt to pin the blame on the affected countries: “crony capitalism” allegedly had somehow crippled their economies!
In other words, the acquaintances and benefactors of the East Asian leaders were “cronies,” whereas those of US leaders were “friends”?
In fact, it was clear that the culprits were the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury, which had encouraged a shift to capital-account convertibility without understanding that the case for free capital flows was not symmetrical with the case for free trade.
But where substantial corruption can unambiguously be found, as it often can, one must recognize that it is not a cultural given.
On the contrary, often it is the result of policies that have fed it.
India in the 1950’s had a civil service, and a political class, that were the envy of the world.
If that seems shocking today, the loss of virtue must be traced to the all-pervasive “permit raj,” with its licensing requirements to import, produce, and invest, which grew to gargantuan proportions.
High-level bureaucrats quickly discovered that licenses could be bartered for favors, while politicians saw in the system the means to help important financial backers.
Once the system had taken root, corruption percolated downward, from senior bureaucrats and politicians, who could be bribed do what they were not supposed to do, to lower-level bureaucrats, who would not do what there were supposed to do unless bribed.
Clerks would not bring out files, or get you your birth certificate or land title, unless you greased their palms.
But if policies can create corruption, it is equally true that the cost of corruption will vary with the specific policies.
The cost of corruption has been particularly high in India and Indonesia, where policies created monopolies that earned scarcity rents, which were then allocated to officials’ family members.
Such “rent-creating” corruption is quite expensive and corrosive of growth.
By contrast, in China, the corruption has largely been of the “profit-sharing” variety, whereby family members are given a stake in the enterprise so that their earnings increase as profits increase – a type of corruption that promotes growth.
In the long run, of course, both types of corruption are corrosive of the respect and trust that good governance requires, which can undermine economic performance in its own right.
But that does not absolve us of the responsibility to define corruption properly – and to acknowledge obvious and important cultural differences in how it is understood.
Getting Investment in Europe Right
PARIS – The European Commission’s new president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has put public investment back on the agenda with his idea of a three-year €300 billion ($378 billion) capital spending plan.
The European Union’s leaders are expected to discuss his proposal in December.
Everyone seems to agree that more investment would help to strengthen a worryingly feeble European economy.
But, behind the superficial consensus, many questions remain unanswered.
For starters, this is not the first time that Europe has considered such an initiative.
In 1993, the Commission, under Jacques Delors, proposed a capital spending plan in its White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment.
The plan was broadly endorsed, but no action was taken.
Likewise, in 2000, as part of its Lisbon Strategy, the EU sought to increase national spending on research and development to 3% of GDP.
It failed to reach this target.
More recently, in June 2012, EU leaders adopted a Compact for Growth and Jobs that was supposed to mobilize €120 billion.
The check is still in the mail.
It is indeed easy to pretend to act without taking effective action.
One way is to ask the European Investment Bank (EIB), the EU’s development bank, to lend more.
Such calls face two limitations: the EIB itself is careful not to jeopardize its financial rating by taking on too much risk, and its loans easily substitute for private financing.
More lending therefore can be pointless if it results in the EIB crowding out private financing of the best available projects.
A bridge financed by the EIB may be more affordable than one financed by capital markets, but it remains the same bridge and has the same economic impact.
The size of the EIB’s balance sheet is not a good measure of its effectiveness.
Instead, three investment levers should be used.
The first lever is budgetary: Governments that enjoy fiscal space should spend on economically sound projects.
Public investment is a complement to private investment; if designed and targeted well, it can trigger more private investment, rather than crowding it out.
For example, adequate transport and broadband infrastructure favors the burgeoning of business initiatives.
At a time when markets are willing to lend to solvent governments at historically low rates, there should be little room for hesitation.
Obviously, cheap financing does not justify public investment in projects with dubious social returns, or what development practitioners call “white elephants”: headline-grabbing projects of disputable value but supported by special interests.
Investments should be assessed on the basis of their overall economic impact, with proper procedures put in place to prevent public money from being wasted.
The second lever for investment is regulatory in nature.
Many large-scale investments that only pay off over the long term – for example, in energy, digital infrastructure, and transport – are concentrated in state-regulated sectors, giving governments the power to influence business decisions.
Predictability regarding the future course of regulation would unlock projects held back by uncertainty.
A credible outlook for the price of carbon, for example, would prompt new private-sector investment in cleaner technologies.
Similarly, an agreed European framework for projects that connect countries would remove obstacles to cross-border investment.
These conditions are a long way from being met, which means that profitable investments are not being made.
Changing that would not cost a single euro; it requires only political resolve.
The third lever is financial.
Investment demand has slackened not because interest rates are too high, but because there is not enough risk appetite within the banking system.
Financing in continental Europe is traditionally bank-based, unlike in the US, where capital markets reign supreme.
But banks are being told by regulators to reduce their leverage and to post higher capital when they embark on risky lending, and their creditors are being told that they should not expect to be bailed out if banks get into trouble.
This is intentional.
Governments and citizens in Europe have paid – and are still paying – an astronomically high price for the reckless lending and investment of the 2000s.
Understandably, they do not want to repeat the experience.
The consequence, however, is that high-risk, high-return projects are more difficult to finance than they should be.
If Europe wants to revive its economy and escape stagnation, it needs entrepreneurs to take more risk to innovate.
But its financial system is undergoing a transition from a bank-based to a market-based system that involves risk aversion.
This is where the public side – both national governments and the EU – should step in and share some of the risk with private players.
They should temporarily behave more like investors who scrutinize projects, contribute funding, and earn returns.
Using the EIB and national development banks to this end would help overcome the current impasse.
Would these three types of initiatives add up to €300 billion?
No one knows at this stage.
But this route would be the surest way to reach the goal.
Getting Migration Governance Right
DHAKA – At last year’s United Nations General Assembly summit, world leaders promised to cooperate on ensuring safe, orderly, regular, and responsible migration.
This year, they need to do more to realize that pledge.
UN member states have acknowledged migration’s many benefits, including its role in stabilizing global labor markets, spreading knowledge and ideas, creating diasporas that spur increased trade and investment, and sustaining economies worldwide through remittances, which pay for family members’ health care, education, and housing back home.
But these benefits are easily squandered if, as we’ve seen recently with crises in the Mediterranean Sea, the Andaman Sea, the Central American corridor, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa, migration is not governed responsibly and cooperatively.
More than 4,300 migrants have died this year trying to reach their destinations.
In the Mediterranean Sea alone, 3,200 people have perished, and in the Andaman Sea, just east of the Bay of Bengal, thousands of migrants have been stranded on boats with nowhere to land, or have been held hostage by their traffickers.
Against this backdrop, UN member governments should acknowledge the gap between the ideals they espoused last year and the harsh realities many migrants and refugees continue to face today.
World leaders can rectify this at this month’s General Assembly meeting – and specifically at today’s unprecedented summit on migration and refugees.
World leaders should first renew their commitment to stronger global governance of migration, and agree to hold a first-ever intergovernmental conference in 2018 to focus exclusively on creating a new global compact on migration, as UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon proposed earlier this year.
The mere possibility that UN member states may settle on a new global compact is a significant development.
For far too long, the international community has struggled to govern migration effectively.
Without global-governance institutions and legal frameworks to guide international cooperation, most countries must resort to unilateral management of their own migration flows.
When states fail to govern migration effectively, they create a vacuum that is filled by unscrupulous actors: smugglers, traffickers, and organized-crime.
Meanwhile, countries, migrants, and host communities all lose out as they bear the costs of migration without realizing its benefits.
The UN currently is falling short of providing effective support to member states, migrants, and the societies that host them.
Its member governments need to agree on universal principles to establish an international framework for dealing with migration, and the UN itself should make governance of migration one of its central missions, rather than scattering the task across different agencies.
Fortunately, the International Organization for Migration will join the UN system today.
The IOM is expected to play a leading role in making migration governance more coherent and efficient.
My own country, Bangladesh, initiated the idea of a global compact specifically to improve migration governance.
As the current Chair of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, Bangladesh is committed to ensuring that the lessons learned inform the global compact.
But, to avoid entering into new agreements that merely re-state or re-negotiate existing commitments, world leaders must act now to lay the institutional and legal groundwork for operationalizing previous proposals and make further progress.
International cooperation on migration should be founded on existing intergovernmental agreements, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the 2015 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, and the 2013 Declaration of High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development.
Migration is a multidimensional issue; it requires a comprehensive approach that also respects existing national laws and regulations.
Policymakers should maximize migration’s economic benefits; facilitate legal channels so that migrants don’t choose illegal alternatives; reduce barriers for employment and remittances; manage irregular migration flows; and protect migrants’ safety, especially in war zones or when migration reaches crisis levels, as it has this year.
Countries and nongovernmental organizations must remain vigilant against exploitation of migrants, and governments should share responsibility for accommodating refugees.
And, to keep up with rapidly changing geopolitical conditions, the international community should consider new partnerships in addressing migration and large movements of people.
Finally, effective migration governance requires institutional and legal frameworks that can reconcile sometimes-conflicting considerations.
For example, countries’ national interest in maintaining their sovereignty, controlling their borders, and enforcing their domestic laws must be balanced against migrants’ human rights, their legitimate desire to improve their lives, and societies’ need for immigrants and increased diversity.
By addressing all of these concerns together, the international community can uphold the principle of shared prosperity through shared responsibility, which is at the heart of the UN’s 2030 sustainable development agenda.
The time has come to set the world on a new path of constructive cooperation, instead of populists’ preferred path of destructive unilateralism.
We need only recognize that migration benefits us all to maximize the gains and minimize the pain.
Getting Past the American Election
The pundits have now weighed in mightily in interpreting the American presidential election.
Did the outcome - together with Republican gains in the Congress - represent an endorsement of Bush's positions?
Has the American electorate swung to the right?
Are Americans now more concerned about "values?"
Like price in economics, a single electoral choice compresses a lot of information.
It is a summary of whether, taking everything into account, a citizen prefers one candidate to another.
A host of surveys is required to figure out what it really means, for the United States - and for the world.
This much is clear, however: there is little confidence in Bush's economic policies.
The typical American family knows that it is worse off today than it was four years ago, and appears unconvinced that the tax cuts targeted at upper-income Americans brought the benefits heralded by the Bush administration.
But while Bush was not held back four years ago by the lack of a popular mandate in pushing his agenda, he may be emboldened by the seeming ringing endorsement to push even harder - such as making the tax cuts permanent and partially privatizing social security.
If adopted, these measures will further compound America's fiscal mess.
To the rest of the world, these are America's problems.
Yes, the soaring deficits may contribute somewhat to international financial instability.
Real interest rates may rise, as America borrows more and more.
If declining confidence in US fiscal policy leads to a weaker dollar, Europe and Asia may find it more difficult to export, and if the deficits prove a drag on the American economy, global growth may stall.
But for much of the rest of the world, the real concern is American unilateralism.
An interconnected world needs cooperation and collective action.
Historically, the US has exercised enormous leadership in a world committed to the proposition that no state should dictate collective decisions.
Unfortunately, over the past four years, America's president has lost the credibility necessary to exercise that leadership.
Even if the 59 million votes cast for Bush represented a ringing endorsement of his Iraq policy, it would not restore America's international credibility.
I believe most Americans reject Bush's unilateralism no less than his administration's economic policies.
Before the invasion of Iraq, they wanted America to go to the UN, and today they recognize that America alone cannot maintain order in the Middle East.
Even if Iraq is to bear more of the cost of its own reconstruction, there will have to be debt forgiveness, and this too requires international cooperation.
Those who voted for Bush may not be as outraged by American involvement in torture, or the misleading information about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and connections with Al Qaeda, as those abroad.
But they do not want America alone to shoulder the burdens of international peace, and they are gradually coming to the realization that leadership and cooperation do not come automatically, simply because America is the only superpower.
Some worry whether Bush will use his electoral mandate to engage in more ventures.
As he himself put it, "I earned capital in the campaign … and now I intend to spend it."
Had the Iraq venture been more successful, these worries would have been justified.
There is little secret that there were discussions concerning Iran.
But the doctrine of preemptive war has been badly tarnished, and I remain hopeful that Congress and the American people have learned a painful lesson.
Peace will not quickly be restored to Iraq, and it is hard to conceive of opening up a major new front, when America can hardly manage what it has already undertaken.
Others will, of course, have to continue to bear the costs of the mistaken and mismanaged adventure in Iraq.
Instability in the Middle East will continue to limit oil supplies, discouraging the expansion of production.
High oil prices will dampen global growth in the remainder of 2004 and into 2005.
In the short run, the only response is more conservation, and America's allies should put pressure on America to conserve.
(Another reason stems from recent reports concerning the rapid melting of the polar ice cap, which seem to reconfirm worries about global warming.)
Presidents do make a difference, but every president operates within constraints.
The good news is that the constraints that Bush and the American government will face in the next four years will almost surely limit the damage they will cause.
The rhetoric and posturing, the lack of commitment to human rights or democratic processes, may be - and should be - upsetting, but there will be far more bark than bite.
While America may continue on a path of unilateralism, other countries' stance will make a difference.
Some suggest that the US constitution provided fewer constraints on the president in the conduct of foreign policy, because the requisite checks and balances were to be provided by the powers of the time - Britain and France.
Today, with the US as the only superpower, it is even more important for countries to stand up and express their views - and to stick by them even when pressured.
Some worry that this will worsen relations with the US.
But long-term relationships are based on friendship and respect; coherent, well-argued positions will earn that respect.
Today, many Americans, especially the young, feel far more respect for the countries that recognized the lack of evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction than for those whose leaders repeated the American distortions.
It may be unfortunate that Realpolitik is the order of the day, but it is, so others must learn to play the same game.
Standing up for multilateralism and international rule of law may not only be the morally right thing to do; it is also in the interests of America's allies and, ultimately, America itself.
Getting Practical in Controlling Malaria
Many international assistance programs fail because they are badly designed and/or too complicated.
The result is that the poor don’t get the help they need, and taxpayers in rich countries lose confidence in the use of their aid funds.
A case in point has been malaria control.
If rich countries adopt simpler and more practical strategies to help Africa fight malaria, they can save millions of Africans while building enthusiastic support among their citizens.
Malaria is a killer disease transmitted by a specific species of mosquitoes.
It depends on warm temperatures, and thus is largely a tropical malady.
Africa turns out to be especially unlucky, because it has a combination of high temperatures and the mosquitos that are likely to transmit the disease.
As a result, Africa accounts for 90% of all malaria deaths in the world – including roughly two million children per year.
Yet even in Africa, Malaria is largely preventable and completely treatable at low cost.
Up until now, there has been far too little malaria control.
Prevention is best accomplished by modern anti-malaria bed nets, which are treated with insecticide.
These nets cover people while they sleep, and repel or kill the mosquitoes, which tend to bite during the night.
The nets reduce the number of bites, and the amount of illness, but they do not eliminate them.
If people get bitten despite the nets, they require treatment within a few hours of the onset of symptoms.
There are two major obstacles to solving the malaria problem.
First, Africa’s poor cannot afford insecticide-treated bed nets and the correct medicines.
Many end up taking cheap medicines that are not effective because the malaria parasite has developed resistance to them.
Second, African villagers lack access to cars or trucks, so they have to walk several miles to reach a clinic.
An infected child is often dead or comatose by the time a mother reaches a clinic.
If rich-country governments thought practically about malaria and recognized that it is a full-scale emergency, they could support simple and practical solutions: bed nets and timely access to medicine.
Rich countries would buy bed nets from companies that produce them and work with African governments to distribute them free of charge to every African household.
And they would work with African governments to ensure that the correct medicines are available for quick use within each village.
There are one billion people living in rich donor countries, and the total cost of comprehensive malaria control in Africa – giving bed nets at no cost to all Africans, and providing the right medicines within every village – is around $2.5 billion per year, or just $2.50 per citizen of the rich countries.
But the rich countries have instead adopted failed strategies.
Rather than giving away bed nets, rich-country organizations like the United States Agency for International Development try to sell them to the extreme poor, albeit at heavily discounted prices.
This policy reflects a shortsighted ambition to promote markets rather than the direct and over-riding goals of saving lives and removing bottlenecks to long-term economic development.
The tragic result has been extremely low use of nets throughout most of Africa, since impoverished people lack the purchasing power to buy nets.
Second, donor governments have failed to promote simple ways to ensure the availability of medicines in villages across the continent.
Rather than shipping medicines to each country on the basis of estimated needs, donor agencies have set up a complicated purchasing system that has led to years of delay in getting medicines to the villages.
The pharmaceutical industry, led by Novartis, has been way ahead of donor agencies.
Novartis has agreed to make these medicines available at the cost of production.
But, despite Novartis’s large production capacity, donor agencies have failed to order, buy, and ship the medicines in the required amounts.
Malaria control now faces a period of increasing urgency, as well as renewed hope.
Malaria is spreading, and new scientific evidence indicates that people infected with HIV are more likely to transmit it to others when they are also infected with malaria.
But there is also a growing realization that malaria is a disaster that must be addressed.
US President George W. Bush has launched an important new initiative to help 15 African countries to control malaria, and hosted an unprecedented White House summit in December to rally private-sector support.
Similarly, the Chinese government, the World Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank have recently announced plans to scale up their contributions to the fight against malaria.
A major new citizens’ initiative called Malaria No More is raising private funds to distribute anti-malaria nets.
People across Africa have shown that they are ready to mobilize their efforts if we offer practical means to help them.
The world’s safety, including the safety of people living in rich countries, depends on the global community’s ability to prove that it will come to the aid of all who are in desperate need.
Aid can work wonders if it is practical and directed to those in need.
Malaria control can demonstrate this world-saving lesson once again.
Risking It All
CAMBRIDGE – Those of us who are fortunate enough to live in the developed world fret about myriad minor – or sometimes improbable – hazards: carcinogens in food, air crashes, and so forth.
But we are less secure than we think.
We are in denial about scenarios that could cause such devastation that even one occurrence would be too many.
Much has been written about possible ecological shocks triggered by the impact of a growing human population’s demands on the biosphere, and about the social and political tensions stemming from resource scarcity or climate change.
Even more worrying are the downside risks of powerful new cyber, bio, and nanotechnologies: A few individuals, via error or terror, could ignite a societal breakdown so quickly that government responses would be overwhelmed.
The “Anthropocene” era, in which the main global threats come from humans rather than from nature, became especially risky with the mass deployment of thermonuclear weapons.
Throughout the Cold War, false alarms and miscalculation by both superpowers were a constant occurrence, with several posing a serious risk of triggering nuclear Armageddon.
Those who anxiously lived through the Cuban missile crisis would have been gripped by panic had they realized just how close the world came to catastrophe.
Only later did we learn that President John F. Kennedy at one stage assessed the odds of nuclear war as “somewhere between one in three and even.”
And only when he was long retired did Kennedy’s defense secretary, Robert McNamara, state frankly that “[w]e came within a hairbreadth of nuclear war without realizing it.
It’s no credit to us that we escaped – Khrushchev and Kennedy were lucky as well as wise.”
It is now conventional wisdom that nuclear deterrence worked; and, in a sense, it did.
But that does not mean that it was a wise policy.
If you play Russian roulette with one or two bullets in the barrel, you are more likely to survive than not, but the stakes would need to be astonishingly high – or the value you place on your life inordinately low – for this to seem a wise gamble.
But we were dragooned into just such a gamble throughout the Cold War.
It would be interesting to know what level of risk other leaders thought they were exposing us to, and what odds most citizens would have accepted, had they been asked to give their informed consent.
For my part, I would not have chosen to accept a one in three – or even a one in six – chance of a disaster that would have killed hundreds of millions and shattered our cities, even if the alternative were a Soviet invasion of Western Europe.
And, of course, the devastating consequences of thermonuclear war would have spread far beyond the countries that faced a direct threat.
Fortunately, the threat of global annihilation involving tens of thousands of H-bombs is in abeyance, though there is now more reason to worry that smaller nuclear arsenals might be used in a regional context, or by terrorists.
But when we recall the geopolitical convulsions of the last century – two world wars, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, and so forth – we cannot rule out a global realignment that leads to a future standoff between new superpowers.
A new generation could face its own version of the Cuban missile crisis – one that might be handled with less skill – or less luck – than the original was.
Nuclear weapons are the darkest side of twentieth-century science.
But there are novel concerns stemming from the impact of fast-developing twenty-first-century technologies.
Our interconnected world depends on elaborate networks: power grids, air traffic control, international finance, just-in-time delivery, and so forth.
Unless these networks are highly resilient, their manifest benefits could be outweighed by catastrophic (albeit rare) breakdowns.
Moreover, a contagion of social and economic breakdown would spread worldwide via computer networks and “digital wildfire” literally at the speed of light.
Concern about cyber-attacks, by criminals or hostile countries, is rising sharply.
Likewise, while it is hard to make a clandestine H-bomb, millions will one day have the capability and resources to misuse biotechnology, just as they can misuse cybertechnology today.
The physicist Freeman Dyson foresees a time when children will be able to design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets.
Were this to happen, our ecology (and even our species) surely would not survive unscathed.
And, as for cybertechnology, should we worry about another science fiction scenario – that a network of computers could develop a mind of its own and threaten us all?
Some would dismiss such concerns as a jeremiad; after all, human societies have survived for millennia, despite storms, earthquakes, and pestilence.
But these human-induced threats are different: They are new, so we have had limited exposure to them and cannot be so sanguine that, if disaster struck, we would survive for long – or that governments could cope.
It follows that we have no grounds for confidence that we could survive the worst that even more powerful future technologies could inflict on us.
In a media landscape saturated with sensational science stories, end-times Hollywood productions, and Mayan warnings of apocalypse, it may be hard to persuade the public that potential catastrophes could arise as unexpectedly as the 2008 financial crisis did – and with a far greater impact.
Existential risks receive disproportionately little serious attention.
Some suggested scenarios can be dismissed, but we should surely try to assess which ones cannot – and study how to mitigate them.
Getting Serious About Global Poverty
Institutions and governments, like people, make bold resolutions at the beginning of every year.
But, for the millions who face the crushing burden of poverty, mere proclamations that help is on the way are not enough to create jobs or foster development.
This year, the international community must move decisively from pledges to action in the effort to reduce poverty.
What will this require?
In 2005, the international community renewed its commitments to help the poorest countries meet the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s), which aim to halve poverty by 2015.
These commitments include significant increases in debt relief and aid.
While there has been progress on implementing debt-relief measures, the international community must follow through on the other part of its pledge, by delivering increased aid and promoting its better use.
Multilateral lenders have long understood the importance of debt relief to poverty reduction.
Indeed, the joint IMF-World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative was launched in 1996 to coordinate efforts by multilateral organizations and governments to reduce poor countries’ debt burdens to sustainable levels.
So far, the results are encouraging.
Before the HIPC Initiative, eligible countries spent, on average, slightly more on debt service than on health and education combined.
Now, debt in the 28 countries for which relief has been approved has declined by an average of two-thirds, while their expenditures on health, education, and other social services have risen to almost four times the amount of debt-service payments.
In 2005, the international community went further, agreeing on the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), which will write off 100% of many poor countries’ debts to the IMF, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank.
As a result, just this past December, the IMF approved immediate, full relief for 19 countries – including 13 in Africa, four in Latin America, and two in Asia – on all outstanding debt to the Fund disbursed before January 1, 2005.
Other countries are eligible, and the IMF is helping these states make rapid progress to qualify, with total debt relief expected to be more than $5 billion.
As with the HIPC Initiative of which it is a part, the MDRI will do more than reduce debt: it will free up resources that can be devoted to poverty reduction and economic development.
In 2006, for example, Zambia will see its debt fall by almost 10% of GDP, leaving more resources available for development.
Similarly, Guyana will have its debt reduced by more than 8% of GDP.
The level of debt relief will be even greater once the World Bank and the African Development Bank finalize their own programs in the months ahead.
Nevertheless, the debt relief now being implemented will only provide a small part of the assistance, both financial and technical, that low-income countries need to meet the MDG’s.
If they are to be met, donors must also deliver on their commitments for significant increases in aid.
The IMF has long called on donors to meet the internationally accepted target for overseas development assistance of 0.7% of GDP.
Some donors have now promised to do so, though only over time; others are not ready to go that far, but have promised more aid than they currently give.
The international community must show that it will follow through on these promises.
Donors must provide the help that developing countries urgently need.
At the same time, we must ensure that low-income countries use debt relief and aid efficiently.
One priority is to ensure that large, new infusions of aid do not produce unintended economic outcomes, such as rapid currency appreciation or inflation, which would make recipient countries’ exports less competitive.
Another priority is to ensure that low-income countries that are striving to meet the MDG’s, and which have large financing requirements, avoid a new spiral of indebtedness.
The gains from MDRI debt relief will amount to precious little if low-income countries emerge from their debt burdens only to start the cycle anew by amassing fresh debt.
But recipient countries must complement donor efforts, and continue to do their part as well, by maintaining a track record of reform and sound macroeconomic policies, and by making the best possible use of the higher levels of assistance.
Outside efforts can help reduce poverty, but it is, ultimately, the efforts of low-income countries themselves to sustain strong economic performance, improve governance, and develop stable and effective institutions that will have the most important impact on reducing poverty.
Low-income countries can also improve their prospects by strengthening their fiscal management, fostering private-sector development, and liberalizing trade.
If we keep our promises, 2006 can be a year of hope for those who have little else than the dream of a better life.
Getting Serious in Russia's War on Terror
Russia's decision to spend an extra 157 billion rubles (over $5 billion) to fight terrorism is a more impressive response than all the Kremlin's recent tough talk, including President Vladimir Putin's demand that more power be centralized in his hands.
Indeed, after the hostage crisis in the Dubrovka Theater in Moscow in 2002, the same sort of harsh words flowed, but no extra money was spent.
These new billions do seem to demonstrate renewed government resolve, but is throwing money at the war on terror enough?
The Kremlin refuses to publicly admit that today's terrorism has its roots predominantly in the Chechen war, which is now metastasizing throughout the Northern Caucasus.
Chechen fighters and their supporters demonstrate almost daily that the war continues, and countless bold pronouncements, like newly elected Chechen president Alu Alkhanov's recent assertion that "effective measures" have been found to combat terror, look like mere bloviation.
According to Finance Minister Aleksei Kudrin, huge amounts of money are needed to resolve the Chechen problem.
But financial inflows into Chechnya are often more destabilizing than helpful.
President Akhmat Kadyrov, the murdered Chechen president, was right to suggest that 80% of this money ends up in the pockets of Moscow and regional firms who benefit from the Chechen conflict continuing.
So neither money nor military power alone can end the bloodshed, and diplomacy with the less militant Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov seems unlikely, for three reasons.
First, contacts between Maskhadov and a few Russian politicians haven't - at least as of yet - influenced the Kremlin's position.
Second, the subject for negotiations is unclear, because Putin has ruled out Chechen independence, and surrender by the separatists is just as unlikely.
Third, even if negotiations with less militant Chechens occur and succeed, terrorism will continue under the leadership of the religious fanatic Shamil Basaev.
The result of all this is spreading hopelessness.
The thirst for vengeance after the Beslan school massacre makes confrontation between Chechens and Ingushis increasingly possible.
Chechnya's neighboring republic, Dagestan, is witnessing increasing confrontations between radical and traditional Islamic groups, something now also seen in Kabardino-Balkaria.
Unless the Russian state develops a viable policy, fast, all of these areas threaten to become safe havens for terrorists.
What Russia needs is a political response to terror that takes into account its international dimension.
In the last four years, radical Islam has established itself in the Northern Caucasus.
This doesn't mean that all local Muslims have become jihadis.
In fact, the latter are a tiny minority.
But they are energetic, mobilized, and experienced fighters.
These people increasingly identify themselves with the global jihad, and have forged firm links with Muslim radicals in the Middle East, Southern Asia and Europe.
Russia must now follow America's lead in how to fight terror.
Since the attacks of September 2001, the United States has managed to avoid further attacks on its land.
True, the news coming from Iraq is horrible, but the US is fighting a full-blown war in Iraq; it is not engaged in a counterterrorist operation.
Russia's power structures, like those of America, must now be readied to conduct a very long struggle, entirely different from the old Soviet KGB way of suppressing dissent.
Russia's security forces need to learn to be pro-active, because the terrorists consistently seek to perfect their deadly methods.
The fight against terror turns on who will strike first; so far, the terrorists have been faster and more professional than the Russian state.
To conduct this struggle effectively, Russia must abandon two hoary stereotypes: that all terrorists are bandits, and that they somehow are acting under some Western intelligence supervision to weaken Russia.
The base of world terrorism consists of daring fanatics who believe in a sacred, fiery destiny.
Osama bin Laden doesn't work for money and wants to destroy the entire West, not weaken Russia in particular.
But the greatest obstacle that must be confronted if Russia is to wage war on terror effectively is the rampant corruption in the security forces.
It is well known, for example, that Basaev's fanatical killers paid off Russian militia to enter Budeonovsk in 1995 and kill hospital patients.
Yet nothing has been done to root out this tool of terror.
It is all too easy to reduce the fight against terrorism to tightening the political screws, to a strengthening of Putin's power, to restricting the movement of people within the country.
But none of these measures will frighten extremists in the Northern Caucasus or their al Qaeda allies.
The Kremlin must know this already.
Even Putin's predictable presidential rhetoric reveals a desire to initiate a real fight against terrorism.
But waging a serious war requires a serious reorganization of Russia's power structures, which will be very painful.
Despite Putin's so far unsuccessful fight against terrorism, his popularity remains high, so he has the political capital to make tough internal reforms.
But he must act now, for public support can be no substitute for resolute and effective action.
Getting to Yes (Again) with Germany
GENEVA – Europe’s slow-motion sovereign-debt crisis may appear unique, but it is not.
Just a few decades ago, Europe had the Exchange Rate Mechanism, which collapsed during a crisis very much akin to the one afflicting Europe today.
Will the outcome this time be different?
The ERM was an arrangement that pegged most European currencies’ exchange-rate movements within limited bands.
But ERM members’ monetary policies remained home-grown, which, no surprise, occasionally led to fiscal imbalances.
When capital markets smelled a problem among ERM members, they invariably shorted the most vulnerable currency and pushed that country’s authorities to devalue.
Authorities resisted, blamed speculators, and then, usually over a frantic few days, gave in.
Markets also tested the resolve of policymakers in otherwise sound ERM countries, particularly when there were big strikes or important elections.
In those cases, even a government with the proper economic fundamentals and its financial house in order could still run into trouble.
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet is well aware of this: in the early 1990’s, he confronted such a crisis as Governor of the Bank of France.
Some contemporary observers of the ERM thought that there was an easy fix for these troubles.
If the central bank of the country that printed its “strong currency” (Germany) had been willing to provide unlimited support to a “weak currency,” things would have been sorted out.
Germany’s Bundesbank, it was suggested, would stand ready to buy “unlimited quantities” of lire or francs, so no one would dare to short either currency.
The notion of “unlimited quantities” was important: speculators would force officials to exhaust limited quantities, with the purchasing authority (the Bundesbank) eventually bearing the loss.
Monetary support would lead to fiscal transfers, making limited interventions a non-starter.
With unlimited support, by contrast, every single speculator could be quashed, and no loss would be borne (since intervention to support a weak currency would succeed).
The only problem was that both the Bundesbank and the German government always fiercely resisted such an arrangement, on the grounds that it could lead to the printing of unlimited quantities of Deutschmarks, and thus stoke inflation.
Instead, Europe developed the euro, which solved the problem of speculative attacks and monetary credibility by replacing individual currencies with a new one.
It was impossible to short the lira or the franc because there were no more lire or francs.
But Italy and France had to give something in return for this security: the ECB was made independent of all eurozone governments.
Yet the current debt crisis has resurrected the old problem, with debt now filling the role that currencies played under the ERM.
Some eurozone countries borrowed excessively and have been punished by the markets, perhaps deservedly so, while others, in the resulting climate of anxiety, have become targets for speculators.
On July 21, eurozone leaders agreed to make “more extensive” use of the new European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) by permitting it to purchase endangered eurozone countries’ debt in secondary markets.
But the EFSF’s “more extensive interventions” recalls the “unlimited quantities” of foreign-exchange intervention proposed to rescue the ERM.
If “more extensive” means piecemeal limited commitments that will eventually be exhausted, the scheme runs the risk of creating losses (just as the Bundesbank would have suffered losses had it engaged in limited defense of weak ERM currencies).
To rule this out, “unlimited interventions” would be needed.
But with whose resources, and under whose authority?
This explains the growing excitement about issuing “Eurobonds.”
The conversion of all eurozone national bonds into obligations jointly recognized by all eurozone governments is a replica of the solution to the ERM’s breakdown, which consisted in abandoning national currencies in favor of the euro.
This would cost Germany control over the quality of its credit, just as the replacement of the Bundesbank by the ECB implied Germany’s loss of control over the quality of its currency (though it was given a large role in designing the ECB).
What is missing in today’s proposals is the equivalent of the ECB’s independence, which ensured Germany’s participation in the euro.
It is no coincidence that one of the leading opponents – the ECB’s first chief economist, Otmar Issing – of the “unlimited interventions” policy under the ERM recently rebuked both the “extended-EFSF” and Eurobonds.
The current proposals, Issing argues, are “undemocratic.”
The concessions needed to ensure German participation are likely to be enormous.
With markets’ ability to monitor dubious borrowers, the guarantees will probably have to be institutional, constitutional, and political – probably formal control over European fiscal policy by a body at least as credible as the ECB, which would mean a dramatic reduction in the power of national parliaments.
Such radical changes would require the consent of all eurozone countries.
And the Bundestag (not Standard and Poor’s) would have to be happy.
Anything short of this is bound to fail.
Getting to "Yes" with Iran
There is a wise American saying: “If you are in a hole, stop digging.”
The six governments that are currently considering the next steps to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb – the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany – should heed that advice.
Otherwise, they could end up without any handle on the Iranian nuclear program, and only one – useless – option left, a military strike.
Yet the six governments seem determined to continue with what has been their strategy so far.
Their condition for negotiating with Iran is a prior halt of its nuclear enrichment activities.
Only in exchange for Iran’s permanent renunciation of enrichment will they provide major rewards – from lifting all sanctions and trade restrictions to security guarantees.
This strategy has not worked and will not work.
Under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of which Iran is still a member, countries are entitled to engage in enriching uranium for civilian purposes, and Iran claims that this is all it wants.
True, Iran’s total halt of its enrichment program would be welcome, not least because its government has hidden these activities for almost two decades from Treaty inspectors, suggesting other than purely civilian motives.
But the issue of enrichment has been blown up into such a symbol of national sovereignty in Iran that no government there, not only the current Achmadinejad administration, will climb down.
Indeed, when the UN Security Council formally demanded a stop to the enrichment program and imposed mild sanctions last December, Iran’s defiant answer was to increase enrichment activity.
So what to do now?
The Bush administration, predictably, is pushing for new and tougher sanctions, based on an implied warning in the earlier UN Resolution, and arguing, as it did in the run-up to the invasion in Iraq, that the UN’s credibility is at stake.
But the only real test of UN credibility in this conflict is whether it can succeed in restricting Iran as much as possible to a purely civilian nuclear program.
If the Security Council fails to agree on new sanctions – which is likely, given Chinese and Russian objections – it would be exposed as a paper tiger.
If, on the other hand, it works out a consensus on more economic and possibly even military punishment, the UN’s credibility would depend on whether these moves produce Iranian compliance.
That, however, is unlikely.
Tougher economic sanctions will not force Iran to comply; instead, sanctions will merely hit this oil- and gas-rich country’s trading partners.
More threats will only push the international community further along the spiral of escalation and, possibly, into military action.
There are those in Bush’s entourage who would like nothing better.
While even a major air attack would fall short of destroying all of Iran’s nuclear installations and, moreover, leave the technical know-how intact, it might at least slow down the program for a while and serve as a warning to other potential proliferators.
But it is a foolhardy gamble.
Today, Iran declares that it wants to observe the NPT, and that has no intention of building a nuclear bomb.
After a military attack by the United States, both promises would be history.
If the six governments want to avoid the escalation spiral and curb the proliferation dynamic, they need to change strategy and objective.
Instead of making a halt to uranium enrichment the be-all and end-all of their effort, their central objective should be to subject the Iranian activities to as much verification as possible: if Iran wants to enrich, so be it, but it must accept intrusive international inspections.
This is a bargain that the Iranians themselves have repeatedly hinted at.
The Six have refused because verification cannot provide an absolute guarantee against the diversion of some enriched uranium to military use.
But as the superpowers learned in the Cold War, the absence of airtight verification does not render inspections useless.
They would still submit the Iranian program to greater restrictions than is the case today.
And such an agreement would open the way to a wider agreement between Iran and the West for cooperation and regional stability.
That is why the Six should stop digging a deeper hole.
Instead of formulating new sanctions for the UN Security Council, they should use the next few months to explore confidentially what level of restrictions combined with verification Iran would consider in exchange for undisputed enrichment.
By all means, the Six should keep the option of more biting resolutions as an inducement to Iranian compromise.
But those who now call on the Security Council to issue rapid condemnations of Iran’s behavior should keep two things in mind: they are unlikely to have any effect, and the US has already used such resolutions as a pretext for launching military action on its own.
Getting to Yes With Iran
WASHINGTON, DC – With the release of America’s National Intelligence Estimate, according to which Iran has suspended its nuclear weapons program, the prospect of military confrontation with the Bush administration dimmed.
But months later, it is clear that the danger is not past, because Iran has not renounced the production of nuclear weapons, which its enriched uranium could eventually be used to fuel.
All parties need to find a formula to resolve the issue before it again threatens to erupt into conflict.
Western diplomacy in recent years has focused on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad as the key to resolving the crisis.
But this approach is a blind alley.
Let us recall the fate of Ahmedinejad’s two immediate predecessors.
Muhammad Khatami (1997-2005) tried to implement dramatic political reform, while Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989-97) tried to open the Iranian economy to the West.
Both failed, because Iran’s presidents do not run the country.
A solution to the nuclear dilemma – or any other problem in Iran’s foreign relations – is in the hands of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Among his responsibilities, Khamenei serves as commander-in-chief of the military, controls the intelligence services, and appoints directors of the national media.
His appointees effectively control most ministries and Iran’s major cities.
In diplomacy, Khamenei tends to operate in a clever but recognizable fashion.
He sends different diplomats into negotiations with contradictory instructions.
Each claims to be acting with the Supreme Leader’s full authority, but ultimately are unable to make commitments because they have little idea of what Khamenei wants to do.
After a time, they are removed, and a new set of representatives is dispatched.
In order to dominate decision-making, Khamenei prefers weak presidents.
Ahmedinejad is no different.
His political base has faded, owing to Iran’s deepening economic crisis, which has been intensified by the conflict with the West over the nuclear issue.
His support in the parliamentary election next March seems particularly weak, which will no doubt please Western observers.
But the election results will not matter: parliament, too, has little influence over Iran’s foreign policy.
Some Western diplomats recognize the Supreme Leader’s role.
In practice, however, Western diplomacy tends to ignore Khamenei, who sabotages any effort to get around him as the final arbiter of Iranian policy. This might partly explain why Khamenei has been mistrustful of negotiations with the West.
Westerners don’t seem to understand who is in charge.
Indeed, some analysts argue that former President Bill Clinton’s efforts to achieve a breakthrough with Iran failed because they were addressed to Iran’s presidents.
The West should learn from the example of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who did not travel to Iran until he was allowed a direct meeting with Khamenei, during which Putin is reported to have made a proposal to end the nuclear stand-off.
There has been no answer yet, though there does seem to be some recent movement between Russia and Iran on the provision of nuclear fuel for Iran’s controversial reactors.
To be sure, Khamenei is reluctant to meet with non-Muslim foreign leaders.
But that shouldn’t stop the West from reaching out to him directly, or pressing him to publicly appoint the representatives who negotiate with the West.
One American politician who understands how to work with the Iranian power structure is former Congressman Lee Hamilton, now head of the Woodrow Wilson Center.
When Wilson Center researcher Haleh Esfandiari was arrested in Iran, Hamilton wrote to Khamenei, pleading for her release on humanitarian grounds.
Khamenei responded – reportedly the first time he answered an American – and Esfandiari was released in a matter of days.
Khamenei would be hard-pressed to ignore a direct invitation from the US to negotiate on Iran’s most vital concerns.
His clear priority is the Islamic Republic’s survival, not the fate of particular Iranian politicians.
While Ahmedinejad’s apocalyptic vision makes it difficult for westerners to deal with him, Khamenei does not want to stumble into a military confrontation with the West, which would destabilize Iran and possibly lead to the regime’s downfall.
To resolve outstanding issues with Iran, the West should be dealing with the only person powerful enough to make deals and deliver concessions.
That person is Khamenei, not Ahmedinejad.
Reinventing the Inter-Korean Relationship
SEOUL – On February 12, 2013, North Korea carried out its third nuclear test in the run-up to the inauguration of a new administration – my own – in the South.
Around that time, the Presidential Transition Committee adopted the “Trust-Building Process on the Korean Peninsula” as a key policy of the new administration.
Though the North’s nuclear test created pressure to revise the trust-building process, I made it clear that I would stay the course.
Indeed, since its conception, the trust-building process has taken into account possible military provocations from North Korea, and is intended specifically to break the vicious cycle of provocations followed by compromise and rewards to placate tensions.
The trust-building process was formulated to overcome the limitations of both appeasement and hardline policies: while the former depended entirely on the North’s tenuous good faith, the latter implied only relentless pressure.
The trust-building process, based on the strength of formidable deterrence, is intended to build sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula by making North Korea pay dearly for its aggressive acts while ensuring opportunities for change and assistance if it is willing to become a responsible member of the international community.
Since the launch of my administration, North Korea has escalated its military threats and bellicose rhetoric against the South.
In April 2013, the North took the extreme step of unilaterally barring South Korean workers from entering the Gaesong Industrial Complex, a symbol of inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation, and withdrawing all of its own workers.
Following the shutdown of the Gaesong facility, some suggested that the North be offered, through back-channel contacts, incentives to improve inter-Korean relations.
But, aware that such contacts with the North had produced many adverse effects in the past, I opted for an open and transparent proposal for dialogue.
I repeatedly emphasized to North Korea that trust can be built only by cooperating on small but meaningful projects and abiding by our promises – and calling attention to problematic behaviors – along the way.
I have also explained to the international community the credibility and necessity of anchoring our policy in the trust-building process, securing support from many countries.
North Korea finally came to the dialogue in mid-July, and a month later agreed to normalize the operation of the Gaesong Industrial Complex in a constructive manner.
As follow-up measures, a secretariat for the joint management of the complex was established, and government officials from the two Koreas began daily meetings.
It was a small but significant step forward, considering that inter-Korean dialogue has been virtually non-existent over the past five years, and that tensions stoked by the North reached a peak in the early days of my administration.
But there is still a long way to go to full normalization of the Gaesong facility, not to mention inter-Korean relations.
The North remains lukewarm on the follow-up dialogue for passage of workers, communication, and customs clearance, all of which are essential.
Furthermore, North Korea unilaterally canceled the reunion of separated families only a few days before the agreed date, breaking the hearts of those who had long been eagerly awaiting it.
North Korea then resumed its slander and threats against us.
Following the recent purge of Jang Song-thaek, known as the North’s “second man,” the political situation on the peninsula has spurred further concern among Koreans and the international community, serving as a reminder of how unpredictable the current situation is – and thus how difficult it has become to develop inter-Korean relations.
For the past ten months, my government has sought to abide by international norms in implementing its North Korea policy, while trying to meet people’s expectations.
We will stick to these fundamental principles and set the following priorities for future North Korea policies.
First, we will pave the way to peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula.
My government will maintain a strong deterrent capability, because airtight security constitutes the foundation of genuine peace.
From this point, the government will strive to forge sustainable peace through dialogue, exchanges, and cooperation, in order to achieve unification and improve the quality of life of all Koreans.
Korea will also work to consolidate cooperation with the international community in this process.
Unification is certainly a matter for the Korean people to decide, but it should be achieved with the support of neighboring countries, ensuring that unification benefits all parties in the region.
Second, the government will endeavor to upgrade the trust-building process.
To chip away at the deep-rooted suspicion between the two Koreas, we will work to strengthen inter-Korean dialogue and discuss matters prudentially while keeping promises on what is agreed.
My government will devise various measures to expand the scope of South-North dialogue and cooperation.
And we will continue providing humanitarian assistance to the North, as well as maintaining efforts to hold reunions of separated families and to resolve the issue of prisoners of war and abductees who have been kept in the North.
In addition, we will increase the transparency of our North Korea policies.
Of course, considering the nature of inter-Korean relations, not all matters can be disclosed in full detail.
But providing as much accurate information as possible to the public is the best way to ensure firm popular support for these policies and their effective implementation.
Third, Korea will seek denuclearization of the North as a means to pursue joint progress on the Korean Peninsula and across Northeast Asia.
Indeed, inter-Korean relations can properly progress when the North forswears nuclear development and joins the South in a partnership based on mutual confidence.
If the North shows a firm commitment to denuclearization and takes practical steps to this end, we will take the lead in securing the international community’s support for active assistance in the North’s economic development.
Furthermore, we will endeavor to help the peninsula progress together with our neighbors in the Northeast Asian region.
North Korea has recently shown interest in setting up special economic development zones.
But no country including South Korea would invest in the North if it persists in nuclear development.
If North Korea truly cares for its people, it must give up the unrealistic twin goals of nuclearization and economic development.
Instead, it must abide by international norms and behave predictably if it is to get along with its neighbors and become a credible partner.
Bringing North Korea in from the cold is important to our foreign policy in a broader context as well.
That is why I have proposed the Eurasian Initiative, which envisions connecting the Eurasian continent’s divided logistics networks and removing obstacles that hinder exchanges to make the continent a viable single entity.
Furthermore, it is linked to my plan for peace and cooperation in Northeast Asia.
To make this Initiative succeed, the Korean Peninsula must be the first to dismantle the wall of distrust, for it is the gateway that links Eurasia and the Pacific.
The project to build a World Peace Park in the DMZ (demilitarized zone) that divides the Korean Peninsula could be a starting point.
From here, the countries of the Continent and the Ocean together with the two Koreas must build trust and promote cooperation, and disseminate such practices to other areas.
As such, the Korean Peninsula would be able to cast off its old role as a stumbling block and revive itself as a stepping-stone for peace in Eurasia and Northeast Asia.
The Promise of Telemedicine
ACCRA/BASEL – In low- and middle-income countries, insufficient access to medical care undermines health outcomes and disadvantages entire generations.
But, in some of the world’s hardest-to-reach communities, technology is revolutionizing patients’ engagement with modern medicine.
In a remote corner of Ghana, one “telemedicine” program illustrates just how effective digital care can be when coverage is extended to those on the medical margins.
In 2011, our organizations launched Ghana’s first telemedicine pilot program, with the goal of creating a model for national expansion.
Starting in the country’s Amansie West District in the Ashanti Region, about 330 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of the capital, Accra, we sought to improve the quality of care in isolated areas, reduce transport times to hospitals, and lower patient costs.
The program, designed in collaboration with global telecommunications providers, universities, and NGOs, initially covered 30 rural communities, and connected some 35,000 people to health-care professionals through a staffed call center.
By linking these communities to a communications hub, nurses, doctors, and specialists were digitally available 24 hours a day, offering immediate support to patients and community-based health workers (CHWs).
Today, we are pleased to report that the program succeeded beyond our most optimistic expectations.
Five years after launch, the number of patient referrals to clinics fell 31% in the pilot area, while more than half of the program’s consultations were resolved by phone.
Each referral that was avoided saved patients, on average, 110 Ghanaian cedis ($25), and the high success rate of closed cases reduced waiting times in clinics.
We have heard many stories of patients whose lives were affected by this digital-health innovation; one in particular sticks with us.
Not long after the program began, a young woman named Debora, who was under the care of a local health worker, began bleeding uncontrollably during childbirth.
Unable to treat her patient, and with no access to an ambulance, the health worker faced a choice.
She could either send Debora to a distant hospital by taxi – an arduous journey over rutted roads – or she could pick up the phone.
After connecting with the regional telemedicine center, a doctor coached the caregiver through Debora’s treatment, and in the process, very likely saved her life.
Buoyed by similar stories, in 2016, the Ghana Health Service began expanding telemedicine access to other parts of the country.
That work was completed last month, and today, six call centers staffed by hundreds of medical professionals are in operation, bringing affordable medical expertise to an estimated six million people.
With this commitment, Ghana is making a bold statement: telemedicine holds the key to expanding universal health coverage, a primary objective of the UN Sustainable Development Goals that Ghana hopes to meet by 2020, ten years ahead of the target date.
But, most exciting of all, Ghana’s program offers a blueprint for how other developing countries can expand their own health-care access.
In developed countries, too, telemedicine is revolutionizing how patients interact with medical professionals.
In the United States, surgeons virtually connect to hospitals to advise on treatment.
In Europe, doctors link up with patients by phone and email to advise on immediate and long-term care.
And across Africa, NGOs like Doctors Without Borders use telemedicine to connect difficult-to-treat patients to specialists in distant countries.
For any telemedicine program, multisector collaboration is crucial.
In Ghana, our organizations partnered with entities like Columbia University, the Millennium Promise Alliance, Ericsson, and Airtel, combining local and international knowledge about health-care innovation with the ability to take on financial risk.
In turn, the Ghana Health Service, the Ministry of Health, the National Health Insurance Authority, and the Ministry of Communications expanded the pilot program, and built telemedicine into the Ministry of Health’s national e-health strategy.
Eventually, the new program could expand beyond basic triage support to offer consultations in disease management, mental health, and other services.
Ghanaians should be proud of the telemedicine program they have built.
Not only is it one of the region’s most comprehensive health-care initiatives; it is also an example of what can be accomplished through health partnerships.
In any country, prosperity begins with access to quality health care, and Ghana now has in place a highly effective approach to providing it.
Ghettoizing Identity
PARIS – Once, as I picked up the Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen at his hotel, the receptionist asked me if I was his driver.
After hesitating, I nodded yes.
Among my various identities that day, that of driver was the most obvious to her.
This sense of multiple identities is something that Sen himself highlighted mischievously in his book Identity and Violence : “The same person can be, for example, a British citizen, of Malaysian origin, with Chinese racial characteristics, a stockbroker, a non-vegetarian, an asthmatic, a linguist, a bodybuilder, a poet, an opponent of abortion, a bird-watcher, an astrologer, and one who believes that God invented Darwin to test the gullible.”
Only a minimum of introspection shows that our difficulty in answering the question, Who am I?, arises from the complexity we face in distinguishing between our many identities and understanding their architecture.
Who am I, indeed, and why should I accept people reducing me and the richness of my identity to only one of its dimensions?
Yet such reductionism lies behind one of today’s dominant concepts, multiculturalism, according to which one of our identities must prevail above all others, serving as the sole criterion for organizing society into distinct groups.
Nowadays, we are often told that there are only two ways for people to integrate into a society: the “British” model of cultural pluralism, and the “French” model, based on acceptance of Republican values and, above all, the concept of equality.
According to the conventional wisdom, Britain’s social model is based on coexistence between different communities, with each continuing to observe its conventions and customs while respecting the country’s laws – an informal federation of communities.
But that common wisdom is grossly mistaken, because British law grants immigrants from all the Commonwealth countries something extraordinary: the right to vote in British elections, even national ones.
Citizens know by experience that democracy does not consist in universal suffrage alone, but also requires a public sphere that is equally open to all.
In the United Kingdom, a large group of immigrants thus share with native Britons the right to participate in public debates on all matters of general interest, whether local or national.
Because fundamental equality is granted in this way, the British system manages to cope better than others do with a greater expression of distinctive identities.
Nowadays, however, Britain’s government itself seems to be forgetting the bedrock conditions of this British model by trying to satisfy the desire of particular communities’ for public recognition by officially promoting things like state-subsidized denominational schools.
According to Sen, this is regrettable because it leads to people giving one of their identities – religious, say, or cultural – priority over all others at a time when it is essential that children broaden their intellectual horizons.
By embracing the kind of separatism that such schools represent, the British are now saying, “This is your identity and you can have nothing else.”
That approach amounts to communitarianism, not multiculturalism.
In the last few years, the “French model” has also been subjected to misinterpretation, due to confusion about its basis – genuine inclusion in the life of society, which means genuine equality in terms of access to public services, the social welfare system, schools and universities, employment, and so on.
Republicanism grants each individual, regardless of his or her other identities equal rights in order to achieve universal equality.
It does not deny distinctive identities and gives each the right to express itself within the private sphere.
The temptation of communitarianism, which the French have debated for at least a decade, comes from the wish to turn the failure of genuine equality into something positive. It offers integration by default within the differentiated space of various communities – a sort of imprisonment by civilization, Sen would say.
But you cannot dress up failure in the clothes of success.
As long as urban areas are socially and economically deprived, communitarianism will only serve to mask the violation of the principle of equality.
Social groups are then measured in terms of their “ethnic” or “racial” differences.
Because the social conditions of the “French model” have been so neglected, the model is now a living contradiction of its core principle: equality.
To reverse the trend, French republicanism must, like English multiculturalism, contradict itself in order to fulfil itself.
The French must recognize that equality before the law is a core principle, but a weak one; it needs to be complemented by a stricter vision of how to achieve equality.
This vision should make republican efforts proportional to the importance of people’s handicap in order to free them from the burden of their initial conditions.
Genuine equality in the public sphere – which differs according to the values and history of each country – implies a minimal level of acceptance of a country’s history and values.
Sen says that what is being accepted here should be thought of as national identity.
But this identity must be open.
It is an identity we share by living together and by what we have in common, whatever the differences between our multiples identities.
The great British novelist Joseph Conrad, born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski to Polish parents in Russian-ruled Ukraine, said that words are the biggest enemy of reality.
The appeal of “national identity” must not be turned into a collective smokescreen behind which inclusion becomes a disembodied dream coexisting with the communitarianism that is now emerging from its failure.
When Leaders Won’t Leave
DUBLIN – The spectacular rise and fall of Carlos Ghosn, “Le Cost Killer” who saved Nissan after 1999 and built a powerful partnership of the Japanese carmaker, its big French shareholder, Renault, and Japan’s Mitsubishi Motors, resembles a Kabuki play, with the Japanese powers-that-be asserting themselves in the end.
But Ghosn’s downfall is really more like a classic Greek tragedy, with contemporary German elements.
This is a story of Hubris meeting Nemesis.
And the best parallel to Ghosn is German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Even superstar managers or political leaders risk disaster if they overestimate their power and outstay their welcome.
That is what Merkel has done by remaining in office for 13 years, making her the longest-serving chancellor since Helmut Kohl held the post, from 1982 to 1998.
Within recent memory, Merkel was seen, rightly or wrongly, in heroic terms for her role in stabilizing the euro single currency.
But when she leaves office, probably in the next few months, she will cut a much-diminished, perhaps even humiliated figure.
At least her fate looks to be better than that of Ghosn, who was arrested in Tokyo when he landed there in a private jet, and now faces accusations that he misappropriated company funds and paid himself millions of dollars in hidden compensation.
Whatever facts eventually emerge, the Brazilian-Lebanese-French executive’s career, which included 18 years running Nissan and 13 years running Renault, has come to an abrupt end.
Ghosn’s arrest holds many lessons.
One is the newly prominent role of whistle-blowers in Japan’s corporate sector.
As in the 2011 accounting scandal involving Olympus Corporation, Ghosn’s alleged misconduct was revealed to the company’s management by an inside source.
Another lesson, however, is that big Japanese firms’ auditing and other corporate-governance safeguards remain weak.
If Ghosn truly has been hiding his real income from Nissan’s published accounts, there must have been collaborators in the company’s finance department, and such practices ought to have been identified by auditors and investigated by independent directors.
Such a sudden, belated disclosure of executive malpractice casts a dark shadow over the entire firm.
That shadow extends to the claim that corporate governance in Japan has been improving substantially, following reforms encouraged by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government.
And yet that failure may be overlooked thanks to a further feature of this tale, evident after the arrest when the man who had been Ghosn’s co-CEO, Hiroto Saikawa, brutally ejected him: Japanese managers have reasserted their traditional solidarity at the firm in an effort to shift the balance of power in the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi Motors alliance away from Renault and back toward Nissan.
This shift risks destabilizing the alliance, but Nissan managers appear to regard that as preferable to being subsumed in a de facto merger – which is what the stories emerging in Tokyo suggest Ghosn was plotting.
Renault currently owns a 43% stake in Nissan, while Nissan holds 15% of Renault and 34% of Mitsubishi Motors.
Crossholdings of that sort are common practice in Japanese business, but full ownership may well have looked like a more sustainable long-term model to Ghosn and to Renault.
The main moral of this tragic tale, however, does not stem from a struggle between Japanese and European practices, much less from a pay squabble and dodgy corporate practices. It is that unless you own a company, you had better not think you can stay at the top of it forever.
Ghosn had remained chairman of Nissan after he stood down as co-CEO last year, and he evidently believed he could still call the shots.
Managing your succession is a key task for any leader, one that must not be left until it is too late.
He failed to do this, in part by failing actually to leave.
That is also what, if you take her literally, Merkel is doing now.
In October, she announced that she would not stand in December for re-election as leader of the Christian Democratic Union, but claimed she would stay on as Chancellor until 2021.
Yet as soon as her successor as party leader is chosen, the drums will begin beating for her immediate retirement – especially if the victor turns out to be her old rival, Friedrich Merz.
She would do far better to pre-empt that pressure by taking the initiative in announcing her own departure in December.
It is too late for her to alter her legacy, which will always be dominated by her controversial decision in 2015 to throw open Germany’s borders to more than a million asylum-seekers from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Her last chance to influence what historians write about her will be to choose the moment and manner of her exit from the political stage.
Ghosn, by contrast, can now affect his legacy only through what his lawyers can prove in whatever trial eventually takes place.
If only he had bowed out a lot sooner, handing over the reins gracefully and completely, his story would have remained one of great achievement.
And a lot less damage would have been done to the companies he once served so well.
The Post-Russian World Order
BRUSSELS – Russia’s intervention in Ukraine and the ensuing Crimea crisis is wrongly seen as the start of Cold War II.
But, while the fallout from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s defiance of international law and public opinion will be very different from that of the Soviet Union’s long campaign to defeat capitalism, the geopolitical ripple effects are certain to be just as far-reaching, if not more so.
Russia is set to sideline itself from the global economy, and by doing so it will usher in a new era in international relations.
International sanctions will be only the first consequence.
Markets and banks penalize uncertainty, so the Russian economy will progressively be cut off from international trade and investment and consigned to a future of slow or no growth.
That is Russia’s own funeral, of course.
The wider consequences will be a shake-up of international politics and of governments’ attempts to address common problems, ranging from global governance to climate change.
The result may even be positive, with events in Ukraine unexpectedly opening the way to a significant realignment of fast-emerging countries whose twenty-first-century roles will be decisive.
The first result of the West’s standoff with Russia is that it spells the end of the BRICS.
For a decade or more, the grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and recently South Africa has been a major feature of world politics, challenging the might and influence of industrialized Europe and America.
But, with Russia set to become a pariah, either pushed out of or withdrawing from global markets and multilateral forums, the days of BRICS summits and institutions, such as the group’s embryonic development bank, appear to be numbered.
The BRICS may not be formally dissolved, but it is hard to imagine that the other four members would be willing to place their own positions in a globalized economy at risk by being drawn into Russia’s quarrel with the world.
Bit by bit, the idea that the group represents a coherent voice in world affairs will be quietly buried.
A maverick Russia, bent on pursuing assertive foreign policies and creating a “Eurasian Union” trade bloc, poses obvious dangers.
The more important outcome, though, will be how Russia’s former BRICS partners realign with other major emerging economies in the G-20.
Cue the arrival on the world stage of MIKTA – a new group made up of Mexico, Indonesia, (South) Korea, Turkey, and Australia.
These countries’ foreign ministers plan to meet soon in Mexico to discuss a joint agenda on global governance issues.
When they first met under the MIKTA banner on the fringes of last September’s United Nations General Assembly, the initiative seemed little more than a club for countries that for one reason or another did not qualify for BRICS membership but fell short of major-power status.
Russia’s self-inflicted difficulties will change all of that.
With the BRICS alliance set to be transformed almost overnight into something of a very different character, the way is cleared for a much larger grouping of countries that share many of the same concerns.
What the MIKTA countries share are rapid economic growth and increasing influence outside of their own borders.
They have development problems, but they are also models of economic dynamism and innovation with a substantial stake in the way post-WWII global institutions and rules should be reshaped.
Many of their challenges and ambitions dovetail with those of the BICS (the BRICS, minus Russia).
In the alphabet soup of international politics, a nine-member jawbreaker like BICSMIKTA might eventually prove too unwieldy to be workable.
The bottom line, though, is that Russia’s coming absence from the multilateral scene will be a catalyst for new thinking on global challenges.
A key question is whether that will revive the G-20 or destroy it.
It seems clear that Russia’s membership in the G-8 will soon be revoked, and that the group will revert to its origins as the G-7, comprising the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, plus the European Union.
But where that will leave the G-20 – including Russia’s continuing participation in it – is much less clear.
The G-20 has been a somewhat disappointing mechanism for tackling global issues, and the idea of bringing emerging economic giants into the same forum as the leading industrialized ones has yet to pay off in terms of measurable achievements.
What is clear is that in today’s increasingly interdependent world, Putin’s distancing of Russia from so much of the international community looks self-defeating.
A generation after the collapse of communism, Russia’s economy and its people’s living standards have started to recover.
But its fast-shrinking population, and its reliance on energy and commodity exports, makes that recovery very fragile.
The Kremlin will soon discover that it is far more vulnerable to outside developments than it has so far acknowledged.
An Economic Roadmap for India
NEW DELHI – India’s incoming prime minister, Narendra Modi, has promised to turn his country’s sluggish economy around.
When asked recently about his reform plans, Modi responded that his roadmap was simply that “Our GDP should grow.”
This seems like an obvious goal, but in recent years India appears to have been losing sight of it.
What will it take to return the Indian economy to sustainable growth?
We believe that the following five simple facts about the Indian economy hold the key.
First, India is a “young” emerging market.
This means that sustaining a high rate of economic growth for the next five years can come about without making dramatic changes to India’s institutions.
A country’s output depends on its inputs, namely its labor force and capital stock, and on the efficiency with which it uses them.
When the capital stock – including infrastructure – is deficient, investing in it is one of the quickest ways to generate growth (as long as finance is available).
This is the “low-hanging fruit” that Modi should go after right away.
It is a much more difficult and gradual process to increase the efficiency of resource use and the skill level of the labor force.
Second, the service sector has been the primary driver of economic growth in the last few decades.
Industry’s share of value added is stuck at 25%, and the share of micro and small enterprises in manufacturing employment in India is 84%, compared to 25% in China.
This is anachronistic for a country at India’s level of development.
The fact that India has moved from an agricultural economy to a service-driven economy with almost no growth in industry is not a virtue; it is an outcome of policies that have hampered manufacturing and mining.
With production costs rising in China, international buyers are looking for alternative sourcing destinations for manufactured products.
If India, with its large labor force, is to seize this opportunity, it must nurture its industrial sector.
Third, India’s rank in the World Bank’s “Ease of doing business index” fell from 116th out of 189 countries in 2006 to 134th in 2013 – clear evidence of stalled reforms.
The new government needs to reverse this trend and improve the environment for doing business.
There is a large constituency of domestic and international investors who will respond positively and rapidly to any steady improvement in India’s institutional environment, which should be an ongoing process.
Here, again, it is not as if large, comprehensive reforms are required.
Significant improvement could be achieved by rule changes to accelerate approval of business permits and environmental clearances, simplify labor regulations, and fill judicial vacancies.
All of this is well known; what is needed now is the will to undertake such reforms and a mechanism for oversight and accountability to ensure that the bureaucracy implements them quickly and effectively.
Fourth, in recent years the lack of fiscal discipline has been costly for the Indian economy, as excessive demand arising from large deficits translated into stubbornly high inflation and was partly responsible for large current-account deficits.
Fiscal discipline should be a priority, not an afterthought.
An emerging market requires a strong commitment to keeping fiscal deficits in check.
New budget legislation, along the lines of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2003, but with more teeth, needs to be instituted.
Lastly, improving the quantity and quality of education and healthcare through partnerships with the private and non-profit sector and researchers is essential to sustain growth beyond the next five years.
The new government should promote researcher-policymaker partnerships to design and evaluate innovative programs to solve knotty policy challenges like improving learning outcomes and boosting preventive health care.
India is fortunate to have thought leaders in almost every sector who could help unleash such innovation in partnership with the civil service.
Just as there is a chief economic adviser in the finance ministry, why not have a technocratic chief education adviser or a chief health adviser to work with the education and health secretaries?
Will a Modi government be able to deliver on these fronts?
Modi has certainly championed economic growth, and he constantly points to his success in building roads and ensuring power supply as Chief Minister in his home state of Gujarat.
The BJP manifesto proposes to pursue “minimal government and maximum governance.”
It is refreshing to encounter this acknowledgment that government might sometimes be the problem.
But replicating Modi’s success in Gujarat at the national level and confronting other development challenges will require cooperation from state governments, which is uncertain at best.
After all, any attempt to change rules and laws (such as labor legislation) that benefit established interest groups invites opposition.
What India’s economy needs has been evident for years; the challenge for the new government is to find a way to get it done.
The IMF’s Next Test
CAMBRIDGE – In October, central bankers, policymakers, private-sector executives, academics, and representatives of civil-society organizations will convene in Washington, DC, for the annual joint meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Among the most important outcomes this year will be the IMF Board of Governors’ decision regarding how to address current international monetary issues.
Global economic conditions remain precarious, with no signs of healthy GDP growth in the eurozone, a weak recovery in the United States, commodity-exporting countries like Australia suffering from diminishing Chinese demand, and an emerging-market slowdown that is now well into its third year.
In such an uncertain environment, even small changes in advanced countries’ monetary policy can destabilize developing economies.
For example, the mere announcement in May that the Federal Reserve would “taper” its purchases of long-term assets drove down the value of emerging-market currencies.
With the Fed considering exiting its quantitative-easing policy altogether and raising interest rates over the next year, global markets are set to experience significant turbulence.
The world needs strategies to mitigate this looming volatility.
The IMF – whose mandate is to maintain balance-of-payments stability worldwide – should be the institution that provides them.
Rather than waiting for a crisis to erupt before intervening, the IMF should provide “forward guidance” on how it will tackle potential disruptions in international financial markets.
Central banks are increasingly using such guidance to communicate monetary policy and anchor market expectations.
For example, the Fed has pledged to keep interest rates low at least until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5% – a move that has arguably lowered long-term borrowing costs.
Likewise, Mark Carney, in his first policy action as Governor of the Bank of England, announced forward guidance for short-term interest rates.
Although the effect of such interest-rate guidance on the economy cannot be determined without additional data, there are many arguments in its favor.
Perhaps the most telling recent example of a central bank using forward guidance effectively was European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s July 2012 announcement that the ECB would do “whatever it takes” to ensure the euro’s survival.
That pledge alone stabilized borrowing costs and dramatically reduced interest-rate spreads for struggling eurozone countries.
Investors’ belief that the ECB would buy up government debt if bond yields rose too high was enough to restore calm; indeed, no central-bank intervention in secondary markets has been necessary since then.
The IMF’s policy tool here is the dollar amount that it is willing to pledge as a backstop in balance-of-payments crises.
By promising to intervene in vulnerable markets in the event of excessive financial volatility, the IMF, as the largest player, would reduce coordination problems among investors.
Moreover, by communicating ex ante its willingness to provide emergency funds, the IMF would reduce the stigma against countries that turn to it for assistance – a stigma that has led countries to delay requesting support until it is too late to mitigate domestic political damage.
The good news is that the IMF has already shown some interest in the idea of forward guidance.
At the annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in August, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde suggested that the Fund would intervene to help emerging markets in crisis.
The bad news is that Lagarde’s vague announcement seems to have done little to shape market expectations or make governments more comfortable requesting IMF assistance.
This underscores a fundamental point: successful forward guidance requires, above all, credibility.
After the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, sparking a global financial crisis whose repercussions are still being felt, G-20 countries offered firm commitments to increase the IMF’s lending resources, thereby enabling the Fund to mitigate the effects of the crisis.
Today, G-20 leaders must again use their influence over IMF policy, this time to push for timely forward guidance and another round of reform of the international financial architecture.
The Fed’s decision in September to postpone tapering its quantitative-easing program has given emerging markets some breathing room, which they should use to bolster themselves against the inevitable reversal of easy-money inflows from the US.
This is also an opportunity for the IMF to formulate and announce its policy to address global financial market turbulence.
To be sure, there is no shortage of issues – such as poverty eradication, aid effectiveness, and international development – to be discussed at the upcoming IMF/World Bank meeting.
But the failure of IMF leaders to produce a forward-looking strategy to confront impending market turmoil would undermine progress in all of these areas.
The last thing that a still-fragile global economy needs is more uncertainty.
Scaling Up Water Sustainability
NEW YORK – Since 2000, when the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were adopted, the global community has rightly focused significant attention on providing access to basic water and sanitation services.
From 1990 to 2010, more than two billion people gained access to improved water sources.
As the United Nations prepares to adopt so-called Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as the post-2015 successor to the MDGs, the high-stakes business of large-scale water infrastructure should be placed front and center.
The conventional wisdom has been that improved access to water depends on digging wells, adopting community-based solutions, and focusing aid programs on reaching more people.
But these important measures are only one part of a much larger – and more capital-intensive – strategy.
According to a recent report by UNICEF and the World Health Organization on their joint monitoring program for water supply and sanitation, more than 1.2 billion of those who gained access to water from 1990 to 2008 had it piped to their premises.
This number dwarfs the impact of the “small-scale” sources – from dug wells to rainwater harvesting – that many believe have done the most to solve the problem.
In fact, the number of those who gained access to water was higher in the decade preceding adoption of the MDGs.
India and China accounted for the vast majority of those gains, as both countries enjoyed rapid economic growth in the 1990’s and were able to lift large numbers of people out of poverty.
As these examples suggest, countries have been most successful at delivering water services when they can rely on their own economic growth to bridge the gap in water-infrastructure costs.
But the gap is widening. The 2013 World Economic Forum Global Risks report identified “water supply crises” as the biggest “societal risk” to global prosperity.
According to some estimates, meeting the needs of a growing global economy will require the world to begin devoting at least $1 trillion annually to water infrastructure within the next 20 years – roughly double the level of annual spending today.
Addressing this development challenge will require new thinking, innovation, and action in areas such as sustainable hydropower, efficient agriculture, and access to safe drinking water for cities.
The first step should be ensuring that the natural infrastructure – the rivers, aquifers, and wetlands that determine the quantity, reliability, and quality of our water – can continue to function.
In many cases, this is by far the most cost-effective option to ensure long-term water sustainability.
Several countries around the world – from Colombia and Mexico to China and the United States – have begun investing along these lines.
They are showing that we can improve outcomes by planning our engineered infrastructure in a way that is compatible with the survival and health of river basins and watersheds.
Of course, even if only 10% of total investment in water resources were committed to cost-effective natural infrastructure – the same proportion that, for example, New York City devotes to protecting its own natural infrastructure, the reservoirs of the Catskills – we would still need to find about $100 billion per year.
Mobilizing capital at that scale requires allocating the right risks to the right investors.
Not surprisingly, the capital available for investments with a limited track record, uncertain future cash flows, and untested regulatory frameworks is extremely scarce.
The key to scaling up investment in natural infrastructure will be to ensure that at every successive stage of growth, there is a sufficient amount of capital available to support the risks involved.
Achieving this goal will require the right blend of public, private, and philanthropic capital.
Public-sector capital has traditionally been the “risk taker of last resort,” underwriting large-scale projects and paying for much of the existing water infrastructure.
But, given credit constraints, many public institutions will be unable to underwrite the development and deployment of new solutions, particularly those that need to establish their track record at scale without a guaranteed revenue source.
Private capital – particularly the large amounts of private savings stored in middle-income countries – could, in principle, single-handedly underwrite new combinations of natural and engineered infrastructure solutions.
But private capital would face significant opportunity costs, and investors are unlikely to opt for vehicles with which they have limited experience.
That leaves philanthropic capital – whether from private or public sources – as a key component of early-stage investment.
Philanthropy has an important role to play in bearing the risks involved while natural-infrastructure solutions establish the track record needed to tap larger sources of public and private capital.
While small-scale solutions, such as dug wells, will remain an important part of efforts to ensure water security, a truly sustainable water-management path – particularly in the fast-developing countries of Latin America, Asia, and Africa – will require hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure investment.
The process of formulating the SDGs offers an ideal opportunity to begin describing such a path.
Giving the Well-Performing State Its Due
MADRID – The triumph of democracy and market-based economics – the “End of History,” as the American political philosopher Francis Fukuyama famously called it – which was proclaimed to be inevitable with the fall of the Berlin Wall, soon proved to be little more than a mirage.
However, following China’s intellectual pirouette to maintain one-party rule while embracing the capitalist credo, history’s interpreters shifted their focus to the economy: not everybody would be free and elect their government, but capitalist prosperity would hold sway worldwide.
Now, however, the economic tumult shaking Europe, the erosion of the middle class in the West, and the growing social inequalities worldwide are undermining capitalism’s claim to universal triumph.
Hard questions are being asked: Is capitalism as we know it doomed?
Is the market no longer able to generate prosperity?
Is China’s brand of state capitalism an alternative and potentially victorious paradigm?
The pervasive soul-searching prompted by such questions has nurtured a growing recognition that capitalism’s success depends not only on macroeconomic policy or economic indicators.
It rests on a bedrock of good governance and the rule of law – in other words, a well-performing state.
The West overlooked the fundamental importance of this while it was fighting communism.
The standard bearers of the Cold War were not just the United States and the Soviet Union, but, in ideological terms, the individual and the collectivity.
When competing in newly independent or developing countries, this ideological opposition became Manichean, fostering a fierce suspicion, if not outright rejection, of rival principles.
As a result, strengthening state institutions was too often seen in the West as communist subterfuge, while the Soviet bloc viewed the slightest notion of individual freedom and responsibility as a stalking horse for capitalist counter-revolution.
Leading economists have long argued that the West’s greater reliance on markets resulted in faster and more robust economic growth.
But viewing the state and the market in terms of their inherent conflict no longer reflects reality (if it ever did).
Indeed, it is increasingly obvious that the threat to capitalism today emanates not from the state’s presence, but rather from its absence or inadequate performance.
Consider recent events in Argentina, which is facing certain economic losses as anxious investors have second thoughts about the country in the aftermath of the government’s nationalization of energy giant YPF.
That response is only logical, as investors seek the security of a well-functioning legal system to protect them from capricious political decisions.
Mexico provides further proof that the market alone is not enough.
An efficient judiciary and effective policing are necessary for capitalism to thrive.
In Brazil, the government is daring, for the first time, to address the lawlessness of the overcrowded favelas that ring the country’s large cities.
Or consider Ghana’s prosperity and how, like Brazil’s, it is going hand in hand with improved governance.
At the opposite extreme, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez’s undermining of his country’s institutions, prodding it onto a narco-state trajectory, places Venezuela alongside Haiti as an exception to Latin America’s recent economic success.
More generally, the world’s thriving countries are those with strong and effective institutions, backed by legal frameworks that guarantee the rule of law.
Latin America and Africa are not the only examples that prove the point.
The European Union’s internal problems, and its ongoing sovereign-debt crisis, are clearly linked to the weakness of its institutions, and, on Europe’s periphery, it still confronts feckless democracies.
Indeed, on Europe’s doorstep, the show trial and imprisonment of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko is jeopardizing her country’s international economic standing.
In particular, President Viktor Yanukovych’s contempt for the rule of law has put Ukraine’s relations with the European Union in cold storage, with a comprehensive free-trade and association agreement on hold pending the release of Tymoshenko and other political prisoners.
Meanwhile, political trials in Egypt are attracting international attention and deterring foreign investment.
In Asia, China is exposing the fallacy of looking at state capitalism as a competing alternative to liberal capitalism.
Approaching them as alternatives is, in fact, little more than an intellectual remnant of the Cold War, much like the concept of “state capitalism” itself.
With its remarkable ability to adapt, China is making strides to accommodate the rising power of its markets and people.
In the process, officials are acknowledging the importance of good governance, as demonstrated by recent efforts to justify the purge and investigation of Bo Xilai as an example of the Communist Party “safeguarding the rule of law.”
Adam Smith, that icon of market theory, argued that wealth is created when public institutions enable the “invisible hand” of the market to align interests.
The Cold War distorted that wisdom.
In a world free of that era’s ideological constraints, it is time to say loud and clear that the future of capitalism is linked to effective governance and the rule of law, and thus to the consolidation of well-functioning states.
Giving Till it Heals
In my new book The End of Poverty , I show how extreme poverty can be ended by 2025, but only if the rich world follows through on its promise to help the poorest countries.
In order to thrive, and to foster the private-sector investment needed for long-term growth, an economy requires functioning health and education systems, investments in soil nutrients and water management, and basic infrastructure such as electricity and motorized transport.
Yet the poorest countries, even well governed ones, lack the resources to finance these investments.
Lack of adequate foreign assistance is one of the greatest disgraces on our planet, and the United States has been the biggest laggard of all.
It is urgent that the US wake up to global realities, and that it follow through on its commitments.
The most famous single promise by the rich countries has been to provide aid to the poorest countries equal to at least 0.7% of their GNP.
The commitment began 44 years ago, in 1961, when the United Nations General Assembly adopted the objective that foreign assistance should increase significantly, “so as to reach as soon as possible approximately 1% of the combined national incomes of the economically advanced countries.”
At the time, foreign assistance was about 0.5% of rich-country income.
Despite the promises, aid continued to decline.
By the early 1990’s, official development assistance was still around 0.33% of donor GNP, and by the early 2000’s, it had declined to around 0.22% of GNP.
Now it is roughly 0.25% of GNP.
But the long-term decline in the ratio of aid to GNP did not stop the rich world from promising time and again to reach 0.7% of GNP, including at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and the Copenhagen Summit on Social Development in 1995.
At the start of the new millennium, the world’s leaders got together to adopt the Millennium Development Goals, the global commitment to halve extreme poverty by 2015.
To implement these commitments, world leaders, including US President George W. Bush, met again in Monterrey, Mexico, to adopt the Monterrey Consensus on how to achieve the breakthrough from poverty.
The personal presence of Bush is notable, because the rich countries once again adopted the target of 0.7% of GNP, with the US being a signatory.
The US government often declares these days that it is not bound by any “arbitrary” numerical target such as 0.7% of GNP.
Top officials even declare that the US never signed on to such a goal.
Yet the US and other countries did sign the Monterrey Consensus urging “developed countries that have not done so to make concrete efforts towards the target of 0.7% of Gross National Product as official development assistance.”
It could hardly be more clear.
Alas, the US has shown absolutely no “concrete efforts” towards keeping this commitment.
In fact, US official development assistance amounts to just 0.15% of America’s GNP, which is less than one-fourth the global target.
This contrasts with the 4% of GNP that the US spends on its military, roughly $500 billion this year.
So the US spends around thirty times more on the military than it does on peaceful development aid for the poorest countries.
From a global point of view, there are currently five countries that have reached 0.7% of GNP in aid: Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.
Six more countries, all in Europe, have recently set a timetable to reach 0.7% of GNP by the year 2015. They are Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his report in advance of the UN summit of world leaders in September 2005, has called on all donor countries to reach at least 0.5% of GNP in aid by 2009, and 0.7% by 2015.
He also noted that countries like Germany and Japan that aspire to permanent UN Security Council membership have a particular responsibility of global stewardship in reaching the target.
Sadly, the ideological mouthpieces for the super-rich in the US, especially the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal , remain bitterly opposed to foreign aid, even if it’s just 70 cents per hundred dollars of income!
In criticizing my book, a Wall Street Journal review said that I was calling for “Giving Till it Hurts.”
But there is a limit to greed.
I am quite sure that The Wall Street Journal does not really represent the interests or views of many or even most of American rich people, including the millionaires and billionaires whose contributions to aid could make a huge difference for the lives of millions of people.
Many remarkable philanthropists, such as Bill Gates, are already leading the way.
I believe that few wealthy people would refuse to contribute a small portion of their huge wealth for the chance to save the lives of millions of people each year and help the poorest countries get the first foot on the ladder of economic development.
They will know that they would not only save lives, but also contribute to a much safer and more prosperous world.
Instead of worrying that 70 cents per $100 is giving till it hurts, our slogan in the rich countries should be “Giving Till it Heals.”
Global Action for Global Recovery
WASHINGTON, DC – The global economy has entered a dangerous new phase.
There is a path to sustained recovery, but it is narrowing.
To navigate it, we need strong political will around the world – leadership over brinksmanship, cooperation over competition, and action over reaction.
One of the main problems today is too much debt in the global financial system – among sovereigns, banks, and households, and especially among the advanced economies.
This is denting confidence and holding back spending, investment, and job creation.
These countries face a weak and bumpy recovery, with unacceptably high unemployment.
The eurozone debt crisis has worsened, and financial strains are rising.
Political indecision in some quarters is making matters worse.
Social tensions bubbling beneath the surface could well add fuel to the crisis of confidence.
In these circumstances, we need collective action for global recovery along four main policy lines: repair, reform, rebalancing, and rebuilding.
First, repair.
Before doing anything else, we must relieve some of the balance-sheet pressures – on sovereigns, households, and banks – that risk smothering the recovery.
Advanced countries need credible medium-term plans to stabilize and reduce public debt.
But consolidating too quickly can hurt the recovery and worsen job prospects.
There is a solution.
Credible measures that deliver and anchor savings in the medium term will help create space to accommodate growth today – by allowing a slower pace of consolidation.
Of course, the precise path is different for each country, as some are under market pressure and have no choice, while others have more space.
It is also important to relieve pressure on household and banks.
With respect to the United States, I welcome President Barack Obama’s recent proposals to address growth and employment; actions like more aggressive principal-reduction programs or helping homeowners to take advantage of low-interest rates would also help.
And, in Europe, the sovereigns must address firmly their financing problems through credible fiscal consolidation.
In addition, to support growth, banks must have sufficient capital buffers.
The second issue is reform, with the financial sector a high priority.
On the positive side, we have broad agreement on higher-quality capital and liquidity standards with appropriate phase-in arrangements.
But substantial gaps remain and must be addressed through international cooperation in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage.
I would also include the social dimension under the reform banner – particularly the need to identify and nurture sources of growth capable of generating sufficient jobs.
This is especially important for the young.
The third target of collective action, rebalancing, has two meanings.
First, it means shifting demand back to the private sector when it is strong enough to carry the load.
That hasn’t happened yet.
Rebalancing also involves a global demand switch from external-deficit countries to those running large current-account surpluses.
With lower spending and higher savings in the advanced economies, key emerging markets must take up the slack and start providing the demand needed to power the global recovery.
But this rebalancing, too, has not happened sufficiently, and if the advanced economies succumb to recession, nobody will escape.
The fourth policy imperative is rebuilding.
Many countries, including those with low income levels, need to rebuild their economic defenses – for example, by strengthening their budget positions – to protect themselves against future storms.
This will also help to provide the space for growth-enhancing public investment and important social safety nets.
In these circumstances, the International Monetary Fund – with its 187 member countries – is uniquely positioned to foster collective action.
Our policy advice can help shine a light on the pressing issues of the day – growth, core vulnerabilities, and interconnectedness.
Our lending can provide breathing space for countries in difficulty.
And, looking beyond the crisis horizon, the IMF can also help construct a safer and more stable international financial system.
This is no time for half-measures or muddling through.
If we seize the moment, we can navigate our way out of this crisis and restore strong, sustainable, and balanced global growth.
But we need to act quickly – and together.
The Global Age of Complexity
NEW YORK – Every century, it seems, has its “age.”
The Renaissance, from a philosophical perspective, has been called the Age of Adventure.
The seventeenth-century Age of Reason was followed by the Age of Enlightenment.
The nineteenth and twentieth centuries were ages of ideology and analysis, respectively.
As for the twenty-first century, I would argue that it is the Age of Complexity.
On the one hand, science and technology have progressed to the point that humans can create life and, through ultra-advanced genome-editing technologies, even engineer new species.
Futurologist Yuval Noah Harari anticipates the imminent rise of Homo deus: a species of humanity that can “play god” by manipulating nature in myriad ways, including delaying and ultimately even conquering death.
Most of the technological trends identified by the US Department of Defense as crucial in the coming years were unheard of just 30 years ago.
On the other hand, much of humanity is besieged by feelings of helplessness and frustration, owing to the challenges we seem unable to resolve, from pollution and climate change to unrelenting radicalism and terrorism.
Economic inequality – reinforced by job losses from automation, deeply entrenched social orders, and damaging political power dynamics – has contributed substantially to this sense of powerlessness.
At a time when our power of creation, matched by our power of destruction, has reached unprecedented levels – when one weapons launch could change the course of history – the development of a more equitable and effective system could not be more urgent.
In this new age of complexity, we need a new paradigm for thinking about the world, and thus for guiding our efforts to advance peace and prosperity.
A prevailing worldview has always been essential to shaping human destiny.
Alexander the Great would not have conquered most of the known world of his time without the influence of his philosopher-teacher Aristotle.
And he was not unique: behind every great empire has been a great philosopher or historian whose worldview imbued the imperial drive with legitimacy and even sacred significance.
(Were history written by the victims, not the victors, empire-building would look a lot less glorious.)
As we move to develop a new worldview to guide our future, we must embrace a truly global perspective.
In the past, analysis of the evolution of humanity’s worldview has tended to focus on the West, following the European and, later, American progression from exploration, colonization, and empire-building, to industrialization, the diffusion of market relations, and technological innovation.
In the twenty-first century, however, this narrative is being revised.
The global economic crisis that originated in the United States in 2007 exposed the fragility of the advanced-country model, giving rise to a new, more multipolar worldview, in which the emerging economies, led by China, India, and Russia, have increasingly challenged the status quo.
Meanwhile, the challenges countries are facing have become increasingly interconnected, with global mega-trends, from climate change to financialization, playing out beyond the purview of individual governments.
As the physicist-turned-ecologist Fritjof Capra and the chemist Pier Luigi Luisi remarked in their 2014 book The Systems View of Life, “the major problems of our time are systemic problems – all interconnected and interdependent.”
Accordingly, “they require systemic solutions.”
In this context, the world needs a more holistic worldview that accepts the pluralism and diversity – in terms of geography, tradition, and governance models – that reflect and reinforce the complexity of today’s global trends.
Such an approach must recognize not just the need for countries to work together to shape the world, but also the limits of our ability to shape it at all.
Humanity has long operated within a paradigm of determinism; we believe we can predict and manipulate outcomes.
But we have not discovered any natural laws or equations that explain how life evolved into its current state, much less indicate how it will evolve in the future.
Determinism has run its course, and must be replaced by a paradigm in which uncertainty is accepted as an irreducible fact of life.
In the natural sciences, this is already happening.
Quantum mechanics, general relativity, and uncertainty have been accepted as the way forward in physics and mathematics.
In biology and neuroscience, there is a growing acceptance that life emerges through cognition (self-awareness and self-generation) and changes constantly, meaning that there is no “prestatable becoming,” in the words of the biologist Stuart Kauffman.
Yet in the social sciences – from economics to politics – this transition has yet to take place.
Economics continues to operate in a largely linear manner, guided by the deterministic eighteenth-century Newtonian framework.
But simple mechanistic theories cannot deal with living, complex, and often quantum systems.
Indeed, the reductionist logic, based on simplistic assumptions, that dominates economics today is at best incomplete, and potentially fundamentally wrong.
Similarly, in politics, we continue to struggle to reach systemic solutions, not least because we often cannot agree on the nature of the complex problem we face.
This partly reflects the global nature of today’s challenges and the diversity of perspectives that therefore must be reconciled.
More fundamentally, it reflects the fact that humans are not always rational – a fact that a new “complexity economics” would do more to acknowledge.
More broadly, a new “complexity worldview” must appreciate that human behavior is driven by everything from politics and economics to culture and psychology – even by technology itself.
In an age of complexity, the institutions we build and sustain demand a system-minded approach that evolves alongside the rapidly progressing natural sciences.
Global Aging and Fiscal Solvency
CAMBRIDGE – Government programs to support retirees are in trouble in every country, owing to increasing life expectancy and the rising ratio of retirees to taxpayers.
The problem will worsen in the years ahead as the adverse demographic trend increases the fiscal burden of funding pensions and health care.
The problem is uniquely different in the United States, because America’s “trust fund” system of financing Social Security will create a crisis when the fund is exhausted.
Though the options at that time will be different from the choices facing other governments, policies to avoid the US crisis are relevant to other countries that confront population aging.
Here’s how the US system works: by law, a payroll tax is dedicated exclusively to financing retiree benefits.
Employers and employees each pay 6.2% of cash earnings up to an individual maximum of $128,000, an amount that increases annually with average wages.
These tax funds are deposited into the Social Security Trust Fund and invested in government bonds.
Individuals are entitled to benefits at age 67 based on their lifetime payroll tax payments, with the option to take actuarially reduced benefits as early as age 62 or to wait until age 72 with an actuarial increase.
The annual benefits rise with an individual’s average lifetime earnings, according to a schedule that causes the ratio of benefits to past earnings to decline as those earnings rise.
Because of the aging of the population, the total level of benefits is increasing more rapidly than tax collections.
In 2010, total Social Security tax revenue was $545 billion and benefit payments totaled $577 billion.
Because the interest on the previously accumulated bonds was $108 billion, the total size of the trust fund increased by $76 billion.
Six years later, in 2016, the tax revenue was up to $679 billion and the benefits were up to $769 billion.
The resulting cash deficit was $90 billion, almost exactly equal to the interest that year, leaving the size of the trust fund relatively unchanged.
Since 2016, the benefit payments have exceeded the combination of the tax funds and the interest, causing the trust fund balance to decline.
Looking ahead, the Social Security Administration’s actuaries estimate that the annual decline in the trust fund will continue, until the balance is zero in 2034.
At that point, the trust fund will no longer have any interest income.
Because benefits can be paid only from the trust fund, the benefits will have to be decreased to the amount of the taxes being received that year.
If Congress does not change the law, the actuaries predict that benefits would have to be reduced immediately in 2034 by 21%.
Alternatively, to avoid that 21% reduction, the tax would have to rise by 26.5%, from a combined 12.4% to nearly 16%.
While it is hard to predict what a future Congress will do, I find it hard to believe that a majority would vote to reduce the level of benefits by 21% or to increase the level of the payroll tax paid by all employers and all employees by 26%.
The most likely alternative would be to use general income tax revenue to maintain the level of benefits.
That would require an increase in personal tax rates of about 10%.
That strategy would shift the burden of the Social Security program to higher-income households, which pay the bulk of personal income taxes.
That may explain why left-of-center politicians are not trying to avoid the future Social Security crisis.
The crisis in 2034 could be prevented by increasing the standard Social Security retirement age, as the US did in 1983.
Back then, with Social Security’s finances in trouble, Congress agreed on a bipartisan basis to raise gradually the standard retirement age from 65 to 67.
Since then, life expectancy for someone at that age has increased by three years.
Congress could now vote to increase gradually the standard Social Security retirement age by another three years, from 67 to 70.
Because life expectancy at 67 is about 17 years, a three-year increase in the age for full benefits would be a 17% reduction in lifetime benefits, almost enough to offset the shortfall that results from the reduced revenue.
It would be even better to adjust the annual retirement age each year for the actuarial increase in life expectancy.
An alternative strategy for dealing with the increasing cost of retiree benefits would be to move away from a pure pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system by adding an investment-based component.
Instead of investing the revenue from the 12.4% payroll tax in government bonds, a significant portion could be invested in a portfolio of equities, as corporate pension systems do.
The trust fund would then grow more rapidly, and the crisis would be avoided.
Although the trust fund system in the US creates the prospect of a crisis when the fund is exhausted, the remedies to avoid that outcome would help other countries that now have a PAYG system – increasing the age for full benefits or combining the existing system with equity funding.
The sooner these changes are made, the more viable the fiscal situation – and the more reliable future benefits – will be.
Do We Want Powerful Leaders?
CAMBRIDGE – A trend toward greater authoritarianism seems to be spreading worldwide.
Vladimir Putin has successfully used nationalism to tighten his control over Russia and seems to enjoy great popularity.
Xi Jinping is regarded as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, presiding over a growing number of crucial decision-making committees.
Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, recently replaced his prime minister with one more compliant with his drive to concentrate executive power.
And some commentators fear that if Donald Trump wins the US presidency in November, he could turn out to be an “American Mussolini.”
Abuse of power is as old as human history.
The Bible reminds us that after David defeated Goliath and later became king, he seduced Bathsheba and deliberately sent her husband to certain death in battle.
Leadership involves the use of power, and, as Lord Acton famously warned, power corrupts.
And yet leaders without power – the ability to cause others to do what we want – cannot lead.
The Harvard psychologist David C. McClelland once distinguished three groups of people by their motivations.
Those who care most about doing something better have a “need for achievement.”
Those who think most about friendly relations with others have a “need for affiliation.”
And those who care most about having an impact on others show a “need for power.”
This third group turned out to be the most effective leaders, which brings us back to Acton.
But power is not good or bad per se.
Like calories in a diet, too little produces emaciation, and too much leads to obesity.
Emotional maturity and training are important means of limiting a narcissistic lust for power, and appropriate institutions are essential to getting the balance right.
Ethics and power can be mutually reinforcing.
But ethics can also be used instrumentally to increase power.
Machiavelli addressed the importance of ethics for leaders, but primarily in terms of the impression that visible displays of virtue made upon followers.
The appearance of virtue is an important source of a leader’s soft power or the ability to get what one wants by attraction rather than coercion or payment.
Indeed, for Machiavelli, a prince’s virtues should only be apparent, never real.
“I will even venture to affirm that if he has and invariably practices them all, they are hurtful, while the appearance of having them is useful.”
Machiavelli also stressed the importance of the hard power of coercion and payment when a leader faces a tradeoff with the soft power of attraction, “since being loved depends upon his subjects, while his being feared depends upon himself.”
Machiavelli believed that when one must choose, it is better to be feared than to be loved.
But he also understood that fear and love are not opposites, and that the opposite of love – hatred – is particularly dangerous for leaders.
The anarchic world of Italian Renaissance city-states was more violent and dangerous than that of today’s democracies, but elements of Machiavelli’s advice remain relevant to modern leaders.
In addition to the courage of the lion, Machiavelli also extolled the strategic deceptiveness of the fox.
Idealism without realism rarely reshapes the world, but as we judge our modern democratic leaders, we should keep both Machiavelli and Acton in mind.
We should look for and support leaders who possess an ethical element of self-restraint and a need for achievement and affiliation as well as for power.
But there is another aspect of Acton’s dilemma besides the ethics of leaders: the demands of followers.
Leadership is a combination of leaders’ traits, followers’ demands, and the context in which they interact.
A Russian public anxious about its status; a Chinese people concerned about rampant corruption; a Turkish population divided over ethnicity and religion: All create enabling environments for leaders who feel a psychological need for power.
Similarly, to satisfy his narcissistic need for power, Trump magnifies the discontent of a part of the population through clever manipulation of television news programs and social media.
This is where institutions play a crucial role.
In the early United States, James Madison and the new country’s other founders saw that neither leaders nor followers would be angels, and that institutions must be designed to reinforce restraints.
They concluded from their study of the ancient Roman Republic that what was needed to prevent the rise of an overweening leader like Julius Caesar was an institutional framework of separation of powers, whereby faction would balance faction.
Madison’s answer to the possibility of an “American Mussolini” was a system of institutional checks and balances ensuring that the US would never resemble Italy in 1922 – or Russia, China, or Turkey today.
The American founders wrestled with the dilemma of how powerful we want our leaders to be.
Their answer was designed to preserve liberty, not maximize government efficiency.
Many commentators have complained about institutional decay, while others point to changes – such as the advent of reality television and social media – that have coarsened the quality of public discourse.
Later this year, we may find out how resilient the American founders’ framework for power and leadership really is.
The Threat To Global Banking Standards
LONDON – The financial crisis of 2008 gave a big boost to the global standard-setters.
Suddenly, the Basel Committee (which sets the standards for international banking supervision) was leading the financial news.
Dinner parties in Manhattan and Kensington were consumed with the finer points of Basel II and the evils of procyclical capital requirements.
Governments that had been suspicious of international interference were eager for tougher global rules to prevent banking crises from spilling across borders and infecting others, like bouts of Asian flu.
The concrete consequences of this enthusiasm were the creation of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), born out of the ashes of the Financial Stability Forum, at the G20’s London summit in April 2009, and inclusion of representatives of all G20 members among the key rule makers in Basel and elsewhere.
The G7’s domination gave way to the hope that broader membership would produce more comprehensive buy-in and stronger political support for increasing the banking system’s capital.
All this change has worked, up to a point.
The Basel III regulations, for example, more than doubled the capital an individual bank should hold, and enhanced the quality of that capital.
The system looks somewhat safer as a result.
But now there are dangerous signs that the commitment to stronger global standards – indeed, to any common standards – may be on the wane.
Many predicted this trend, but for the wrong reason.
Skeptics warned that it would be far harder to reach agreement among 20 or more countries than it had been among the dozen pre-crisis Basel Committee members (mainly European countries, with only the US, Canada, and Japan representing the world beyond).
In practice, that has not turned out to be a major problem.
Basel III was agreed far more quickly than Basel II was.
Political pressure from finance ministers, expressed through the FSB, proved effective.
In fact, recent tensions have been more old-fashioned, pitting the US against the eurozone, with the UK and others stuck in between.
The US has been pressing for tighter controls on banks’ internal models, and for a limit on how much a bank’s models can reduce its assets on a risk-weighted basis.
Agreement on these so-called output floors has so far proved impossible.
The Europeans argue that their banks’ corporate lending is inherently less risky. After all, EU banks lend more to higher-rated large companies, which access US capital markets, rather than borrowing from banks.
They also hold more low-risk mortgages on their balance sheets, in the absence of a European equivalent of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (America’s two quasi-public mortgage banks), which hoovered up securitized US mortgages.
At its meeting in Santiago, Chile, in November, the Basel Committee conspicuously failed to agree on a solution, and kicked the issue upstairs to the committee of Governors and Heads of Supervision, which will try again in January.
They will probably find a way to thread this particular needle.
But the future for global standards looks more uncertain than it has for some time.
Since the 2008 crisis, many countries, while ostensibly supporting the development of tighter global rules, have been taking other measures to protect their own financial systems.
The collapse of Lehman Brothers and others showed, in former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King’s memorable phrase, that big banks are “global in life, but national in death.”
In other words, when a global bank crashes, the host-country regulators must pick up the local pieces.
That’s why requirements to establish local subsidiaries, with local capital, have been adopted.
Gone are the days when banks could set up branches all over the planet, with support from the parent’s balance sheet.
Subsidiarization is now the rule.
And, looking ahead, we can see that the two biggest players in the FSB and Basel have other preoccupations.
Donald Trump’s incoming US administration has already signaled its suspicion of foreign entanglements and international commitments.
Making America great again is not likely to involve new enthusiasm for more intrusive rules made in Basel.
Those who advocate rolling back much of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation, in favor of a higher leverage ratio, as promoted in a bill advanced by Representative Jeb Hensarling, envisage a “Made in the USA” version of banking regulation.
But, while the idea has some merit, it would not sit easily within the current Basel framework.
Europe faces other worries.
Regulators there are now keenly focused on the implications of Brexit, which will require complex arrangements to manage a new relationship between London and the eurozone.
The top priority for the European Central Bank must be to preserve the integrity of the EU banking union, which is under pressure from both Brexit and the crisis gripping Italy’s banks.
Against this background, it will be a challenge to retain the primacy of global standards and to secure continued buy-in to the Basel process.
The Bank for International Settlements’ new general manager, Agustín Carstens, a former governor of Mexico’s central bank, will have a key role to play, as will whoever replaces Mark Carney (the current Governor of the Bank of England) next year as Chairman of the FSB.
It is likely, too, that there will soon be a new Chair of the Basel Committee itself.
Stefan Ingves of Sweden is due to step down next June.
These three new leaders will need all of their diplomatic skills to navigate treacherous political waters.
The stakes are high.
If the commitment to global standards wanes, everyone will suffer in the long run.
Countries will impose incompatible local requirements, which will reduce the efficiency of capital utilization and make the system less robust in the event of renewed financial instability.
Putting Public Health on the Map
SEATTLE – Twenty-five years ago, the state of public health for large populations was like that of a doctor trying to treat a patient without a proper diagnosis.
The diseases and injuries that cut lives short and caused widespread suffering were not rigorously tracked.
Back then, well-meaning advocates for different diseases published death tolls that helped them make the case for funding and attention.
But when all the claims were added up, the total was many times greater than the number of people who actually died in a given year.
And even when policymakers had accurate data, it usually included only causes of death, not the illnesses that afflicted the living.
To address this problem, Alan Lopez and I launched the Global Burden of Disease project (GBD) in 1990.
Decision-makers need information about the world’s biggest health threats and how they have changed over time, across age groups, and by sex, so they can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to live the longest, healthiest life possible.
By ensuring that each death is counted just once, and by providing comprehensive statistics on the causes of ill health, the GBD can compare the impact of cancer to that of lower back pain or depression.
It also enables comparison of health-care performance among countries.
GBD’s 1990 study and subsequent revisions raised the bar for population health measurement, providing decision-makers with more reliable and useful information.
It also opened the international development community’s eyes to the importance of overlooked afflictions, such as mental illness and road injuries.
Donors such as the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation use GBD data to guide their investments, and more than 30 countries have conducted their own burden-of-disease studies.
Countries such as Australia, Botswana, China, Mexico, Norway, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom are using GBD findings to inform health policies.
In China, the results of the GBD project, launched at a policy summit in 2013, raised awareness about the deadly impact of air pollution on the country’s population.
Those findings helped shape the Chinese government’s efforts to curb the negative effects of pollution on health, and Chinese researchers are now key members of the global collaborative effort.
In Rwanda, when the GBD study revealed that indoor air pollution from cooking with solid fuel was a leading cause of death, the government launched a program to distribute one million clean stoves to the most vulnerable households.
Rwandan scientists and officials from the Ministry of Health – including the minister herself – are important contributors to the GBD.
Today, the GBD is constantly improving, thanks to the efforts of more than 1,300 collaborators in 114 countries.
These collaborators improve the models on which the project is built, vet the study results, contribute new data sets, and communicate the results to media outlets, educational institutions, and decision-makers.
The latest GBD study revealed that another disease seldom discussed in international development circles, lower back and neck pain, is the fourth largest cause of health loss globally.
It also highlighted the rapid pace of epidemiological transition in middle-income countries and the persistence of communicable, maternal, newborn, and nutritional disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa.
But the GBD could do more to inform policy debates and spur action to improve health if it were able to provide more detailed breakdowns of data.
Policymakers are accountable, first and foremost, to their constituents, whose unique needs they must meet.
Estimates of local disease burdens will be essential for combating afflictions like Ebola, checking the rising toll of non-communicable diseases in middle-income countries, and meeting the Sustainable Development Goals relating to maternal and child health in Sub-Saharan Africa.
To help decision-makers make better use of their data, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which I head, is creating geospatial maps of disease burdens with a groundbreaking level of resolution.
Creating these maps is possible thanks to methods developed by the Malaria Atlas Project, which has produced a better spatial understanding of malaria than we have for any pathogen.
Geospatial maps can pinpoint areas that are making outstanding progress, allowing us to identify communities that have done things differently from their neighbors.
These case studies can empower communities to replicate one another’s successes.
One example is Cali, Colombia, which drove down homicide rates in the 1990s after the city’s mayor, Rodrigo Guerrero, tightened alcohol restrictions, introduced community-development programs in the most impoverished neighborhoods, and imposed temporary gun bans in public places.
The mayor of Colombia’s capital, Bogota, learned about the program in Cali and implemented similar measures, which have helped reduce homicides steadily in the city.
Since then, Guerrero has worked with the Inter-American Development Bank to develop programs that help other Latin American countries reduce violence in their communities.
In 2014, Guerrero won the Roux Prize for his use of data to improve health, further elevating awareness of his work.
Geospatial mapping will help us identify more Rodrigo Guerreros and champion their achievements.
As the international community comes together to agree on the tools needed to finance and monitor progress toward the MDGs’ successor framework, the Sustainable Development Goals, geospatial mapping will be critical for tracking progress and indicating where course corrections might be needed.
We are far beyond where we were in 1990 in terms of health measurement.
With focused effort and further innovation, we can make even more progress in the next 25 years to help the world make the most of our collective health investments.
Making Climate Promises Count
OTTAWA – This year will be one of the warmest on record.
Over the last decade, greenhouse-gas emissions have accelerated, and the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased in the past year at the fastest rate in nearly three decades, reaching a level that is 15% higher than in 1990.
As the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emphasizes, the disconnect between an intensifying climate crisis and stalled international negotiations has never been greater.
Needless to say, a lot is riding on next year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, which could shape strategies to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions until 2050.
But the summit is unlikely to deliver the global agreement that is so badly needed, unless world leaders broaden their focus to include not only emissions reduction, but also carbon pricing.
A growing number of experts – including those at the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, and the World Bank – agree that no climate plan can be successful without an effective and efficient carbon-pricing system.
The IPCC has concluded that if a single global carbon price is not established soon, it will be virtually impossible to prevent global warming from surpassing 2ºC above preindustrial levels – the threshold beyond which the most devastating effects of climate change would become unavoidable.
The one-dimensional approach based exclusively on emissions-reduction targets is preventing even the regions that have been most active on climate change, such as the European Union, from making sufficient progress.
Yet, in late October, EU member states agreed on a new policy framework for climate and energy for 2030 – one that, like the EU’s 2020 climate and energy package, lacks a solid foundation.
The EU’s established goal of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 40% by 2030 is supported only by non-binding energy-efficiency and renewable-energy targets.
Devoid of true carbon-pricing reform, the deal depends on the EU’s derelict Emissions Trading System.
The result is a set of impressive-sounding commitments without instruments for effective implementation.
The same can be said of the widely touted new bilateral agreement between the United States and China, the world’s two largest carbon emitters.
Given the deadlock that previously prevailed, the deal represents welcome progress; but it, too, lacks adequate instruments to support its ambitions.
The Paris summit next year needs to produce a more substantial agreement, with national emissions-reduction targets underpinned by adequate and coordinated tools for implementation, including a trial global carbon price.
On an issue as urgent as climate change, there simply is no room for ambiguity.
The first step toward creating such an agreement is to initiate a debate, supported by academic research and scientific evidence, aimed at determining a desirable global carbon price and outlining the linkages between current and future prices, taking into account equity, efficiency, and effectiveness.
Such a debate – not emissions-reduction targets guaranteed only by states’ “political will” – will be the mark of a successful summit.
In fact, no outcome would be worse than a “feel-good” agreement composed of vague, unenforceable targets.
The US government’s recent statements in favor of a “political” agreement rather than a “legally binding” accord is yet another indication that official declarations alone will produce precisely such a result.
In the longer term, a constructive debate in Paris on an appropriate global carbon price could pave the way for the development of a new, polycentric approach to climate governance that would value territorial and local initiatives, in addition to national efforts.
At that point, discrete carbon prices could gradually converge toward a single price, as has occurred with prices for commodities like oil.
EU leaders often boast to their global partners of their commitment to mitigating climate change.
And they may be right.
But, so far, the EU has stood out more because the rest of the world is lagging than because it has designed a truly effective strategy to address the problem; its recently concluded agreement could actually serve as a counter-model for next year’s summit.
The price of carbon effectively amounts to the price of human wellbeing on this planet.
If Europe truly wants to lead the fight against climate change, it should bring the issue of a harmonized carbon-pricing system to the negotiating table in Paris.
In doing so, it would launch a critical shift toward a comprehensive and, for the first time, effective climate agreement.
The Climate Fight’s Next Turning Point
PARIS – Next month, the Global Climate Action Summit – one of the largest international gatherings on climate change the world has seen – will be held in San Francisco.
The event, whose theme is “Take Ambition to the Next Level,” aims to serve as a launchpad for accelerated action that will enable the world to meet the goals set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
It is a golden opportunity to make progress in the effort to combat global warming, but it can be seized only with the involvement of all stakeholders.
With the Paris climate agreement, the international community agreed to limit the rise in average global temperature to 2° Celsius – and ideally 1.5°C – above pre-industrial levels.
To that end, national governments were tasked with developing their own climate-action plans, called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
But national governments cannot do it alone.
Everyone – including those at all levels of government, as well as business leaders, investors, and civil society – must contribute.
This calls for a new form of inclusive multilateralism – one that can also be applied to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which complement the Paris agreement’s commitments.
It is a tall order, but there is plenty of reason for optimism.
There is unprecedented global momentum to build a low-carbon, climate-secure future, characterized by a dynamic green economy, a thriving society, and a healthy environment.
Globally, renewable power accounted for 70% of net additions to power-generating capacity in 2017, according to the Renewables 2018 Global Status Report.
Moreover, as part of the Under2 Coalition, over 200 states, regions, and local authorities have committed to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.
Urban centers are also proving their capacity for climate innovation and leadership.
New York City has mandated the retrofitting of 14,500 of the city’s most polluting buildings.
Shenzhen has become the first city in the world with a fully electric bus fleet.
Curitiba, Brazil, has introduced a new model of urban food production.
And Oslo has created a climate budget to guide financial decision-making.
At the business level, more than 700 companies with a total market capitalization of over $16 trillion have made far-reaching climate commitments, according to the We Mean Business Coalition.
And 289 investors, holding nearly $30 trillion in assets, have signed on to Climate 100+, a five-year initiative to engage with the world’s largest corporate greenhouse-gas emitters to improve governance on climate change, curb emissions, and strengthen climate-related financial disclosures.
As a result, global green bond issuance could reach $300 billion this year.
Yet we are far from being in the clear.
Scientists agree that global carbon dioxide emissions must reach a turning point in 2020 if we are to achieve carbon neutrality (with emissions low enough to be safely absorbed by forests, soils, and other natural systems) by mid-century.
So far, nearly 50 countries have or may have reached their emissions peaks, and more may soon join their ranks.
This is progress, but it is not enough.
In fact, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are still accumulating at a rate that will soon take us well above the 1.5°C threshold, beyond which some of the worst effects of climate change cannot be staved off.
Extreme weather already is becoming more common, as exemplified by record-high temperatures worldwide this year.
On current trends, average global temperatures could well rise by 3°C, imperiling vital natural systems like coral reefs, rainforests, and the polar regions.
All relevant stakeholders need to strengthen their climate commitments.
To kick-start that process, the Global Climate Action Summit and its partners have issued a wide array of new challenges, including zero-waste goals in cities, a target of 500 companies adopting science-based targets, and initiatives to accelerate uptake of zero-emission vehicles.
Such efforts would not just protect our environment; they would also boost our economies.
A recent report by the New Climate Economy suggests that, in transportation alone, a low-carbon transition would create 23 million jobs worldwide annually.
Perhaps more important, a show of climate-action ambition from leaders across sectors would likely inspire national governments to increase their own NDCs ahead of this December’s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland, where governments will finalize the implementation guidelines of the Paris agreement.
Acting alone can be difficult.
Acting in concert can inspire and enable all participants to do more.
And if we are to leave a healthy planet to future generations, more is what we need.
Migration Myths vs. Economic Facts
WASHINGTON, DC – On December 19, 2018, the United Nations General Assembly voted to adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, with 152 votes in favor, five votes against, and 12 abstentions.
Supporters hailed the Compact as a step toward more humane and orderly management of migration, yet opposition remains formidable.
Following its targeted killing of Iran's second most powerful leader, the US could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the Middle East, a path that could lead to additional Iranian provocations.
And that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to US interests elsewhere in the world.
The targeted killing by the United States of one of Iran's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the Iranian regime, but it does not augur all-out war.
After all, Iran and the US have already been at war for decades, and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now.
As in previous years, Project Syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months. If there is one common theme in this year's selection, it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come.
The Compact is not a legally binding treaty, nor does it guarantee new rights for migrants.
In fact, the Compact’s 23 objectives were drafted on the basis of two years of inclusive discussions and six rounds of negotiations, focused specifically on creating a framework for international cooperation that would not interfere excessively in countries’ domestic affairs.
Because of misunderstandings about the Compact, it is worth taking a closer look at the migration challenge – and the vast benefits that a well-managed system can bring to host countries and home countries alike.
Migration is motivated, first and foremost, by lack of economic opportunities at home.
With the average income level in high-income countries more than 70 times higher than in low-income countries, it is not surprising that many in the developing world feel compelled to try their luck elsewhere.
This trend is reinforced by demographic shifts.
As high-income countries face population aging, many lower-income countries have burgeoning working-age and youth populations.
Technological disruption is also putting pressure on labor markets.
Moreover, climate change, as indicated by a recent World Bank report, will accelerate the trend, by driving an estimated 140 million people from their homes in the coming decades.
But, contrary to popular belief, nearly half of all migrants do not move from developing to developed countries.
Rather, they migrate among developing countries, often within the same neighborhood.
Moreover, return migration is increasing, a fact that is often overlooked, often because migrants were denied entry into the labor market or their work contracts ended.
For example, the number of newly registered South Asian workers in the Gulf states declined significantly – by anywhere from 12% to 41% – over the last two years. Between 2011 and 2017, the number of potential returnees in Europe – asylum-seekers whose applications were rejected or who were found to be undocumented – increased fourfold, reaching 5.5 million.
Over the same period, the number of potential returnees in the United States more than doubled, to over three million. Return migration from Saudi Arabia and South Africa has increased as well.
Those migrants who remain in their host countries make substantial contributions.
Although the world’s estimated 266 million migrants comprise only about 3.4% of the global population, they contribute more that 9% of GDP.
To achieve this, migrants must overcome high barriers to economic success.
For example, unskilled workers, especially those from poor countries, often pay very high fees – which can exceed an entire year’s income for a migrant worker in some destination countries – to unscrupulous labor agents to find employment outside their own countries. That is why the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include a target to reduce recruitment costs.
Migration also delivers major economic benefits to home countries. While migrants spend most of their wages in their host countries – boosting demand there – they also tend to send money to support families back home.
Such remittances have been known to exceed official development assistance.
Last year, remittances to low- and middle-income countries increased by 11%, reaching $528 billion, exceeding those countries’ inflows of foreign direct investment.
Globally, the largest recipient of remittances is India ($80 billion), followed by China, the Philippines, Mexico, and Egypt. As a share of GDP, the largest recipients were Tonga, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Nepal.
The increase in remittances during 2018 was due to improvement in the labor market in the US and the recovery of flows from Russia and the Gulf States.
But the potential of remittances to support sustainable development is not being met. A major obstacle is the high cost of transferring money.
Migrants sending money home pay, on average, 7% of the total of the transfer itself, owing to weak competition in the market for remittance services – a result of stringent regulations intended to combat financial crimes like money laundering – as well as reliance on inefficient technology.
Achieving the SDG target of reducing transfer costs below 3% – which would support progress toward the target of increasing the total volume of remittances – will require countries to address these weaknesses.
We are closely monitoring these often-overlooked ways that migration can support development, owing to their links to SDG indicators.
But recent research busts other migration myths as well, showing, for example, that migrants neither impose a significant fiscal burden on host countries nor depress wages for lower-skill native workers.
Migration flows are increasing – a trend that is set to continue.
Fragmented migration policies shaped by popular myths cannot manage this process effectively, much less seize the opportunities to spur development that migration creates.
Only a coordinated approach, as envisioned in the Global Compact, can do that.
International Cooperation 2.0
OXFORD – After decades of serving as the backbone of a rules-based global order, the United States, under President Donald Trump, is touting an “America First” agenda that extols narrow economic nationalism and distrust of international institutions and agreements.
But a new type of international cooperation may be emerging – one that works around Trump.
To be sure, as the Trump administration continues to repudiate long-established patterns of cooperation, the risk to global stability is becoming increasingly acute.
For example, at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos last month, US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin spoke positively about a weaker dollar as a way to boost US trade.
For a country that relies on foreign demand for strong dollars and Treasuries to finance its rapidly expanding deficit, this is a foolhardy perspective.
Moreover, it amounts to a betrayal of the longstanding US commitment to uphold a rules-based monetary system that discourages competitive currency devaluation.
In foreign policy, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has endorsed the revival of the Monroe Doctrine – the nineteenth-century assertion of US primacy in the Western Hemisphere that aimed to keep out European competitors – in Central and South America, in order to curb China’s growing influence.
Tillerson’s nostalgia for 1823 was not shared south of the border, where, as one Mexican commentator pointed out, the Monroe Doctrine “served to justify gringo interventions,” and where China’s increasing engagement is viewed as a counterweight to the US.
The Trump administration has also unveiled a new, more aggressive nuclear policy.
Its Nuclear Posture Review proposes using nuclear strikes in response to non-nuclear threats, and deploying new “low-yield” nuclear devices that would deliver by submarine a nuclear bomb equivalent in power to those that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
This policy – aimed, according to Defense Secretary James Mattis, at convincing adversaries that “they have nothing to gain and everything to lose from the use of nuclear weapons” – amounts to a reversal of 40 years of US leadership on reducing nuclear stockpiles and encouraging non-proliferation.
Unsurprisingly, other countries are quickly losing faith in the US as a stable partner, much less a reliable leader.
According to a Gallup poll, trust in US leadership across 134 countries has dropped from a median of 48% in 2016 to 30% in 2018, plummeting by 40 points (or more) in Canada, Portugal, Belgium, and Norway.
Meanwhile, disapproval of US leadership has surged by 15 points, to a median score of 43%, compared with 36% for Russia, 30% for China, and 25% for Germany.
As faith in America’s international leadership declines, so may countries’ commitment to cooperation – trends that could culminate in an economic race to the bottom or even violent conflict.
After all, a country is unlikely to play by the rules if it does not believe that its opponents will do the same.
Japan, for example, will more likely refrain from devaluing its exchange rate if it believes that the US will also refrain.
Of course, some of the Trump administration’s declarations might turn out to be mere bluster.
During President Ronald Reagan’s first term in the early 1980s, he also questioned the international monetary order; took a tougher line on Latin America; and expressed doubts about nuclear deterrence (preferring the idea of nuclear superiority).
But, by his second term, Reagan had come to embrace international cooperation.
At that time, however, US leadership was virtually guaranteed, given that the only other global superpower – the Soviet Union – was in sclerotic decline.
That is not the case today.
But that does not mean that international cooperation is doomed.
In his 1984 book After Hegemony, the American scholar Robert Keohane argued that international cooperation could continue, even without US global dominance.
Keohane’s core insight was that the creation of institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the World Health Organization, and even ad hoc institutions like the G20 may require a clear leader, but running them may not.
Indeed, thanks to such institutions, the burden of leadership is now lighter.
If governments seek to benefit from rules-based systems, such as those governing global trade, they can do so through existing multilateral institutions.
This enables a more diverse array of governments to assume leadership in different areas.
In January 2017, after Trump announced that the US was withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership – the ambitious US-led initiative to create a massive trade and investment bloc encompassing 12 Pacific Rim countries – many assumed that the TPP’s days were numbered.
But a year later, the remaining 11 countries announced that they would be moving forward, based on the so-called Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the TPP.
Likewise, after Trump announced last June that the US would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, many observers feared the worst.
By the end of last year, every other country in the world had become a signatory to the agreement.
Moreover, 15 US states formed the US Climate Alliance, which is committed to upholding the objectives of the Paris agreement.
Finally, Trump’s public questioning of NATO, the US-led security alliance, has spurred Europeans to forge ahead with their own common security plans.
The US, fearing that it could be sidelined, has now raised objections to these moves.
That is not surprising.
The form of international cooperation that is now beginning to emerge promises to reflect more diverse views and interests, with countries adjusting their policies based on a variety of international considerations, not just the preferences and interests of the US.
The result could be new cooperative coalitions, along with updated global institutions.
As for the US, the Trump administration may well find that “America First” really does mean “America Alone.”
Plan B for the Global Economy
HONG KONG – In March, meetings of the G-20, the Chinese National People’s Congress, and multiple think tanks all reflected a growing awareness of the risks to the global economy posed by deflation and intensifying financial instability.
In mitigating these risks, the path that China takes will be particularly important.
But avoiding a hard landing in China is a necessary but insufficient condition for global recovery.
Contrary to the advice of many Chinese economists, the country’s policymakers have opted not to follow the conventional Western approach of using flexible exchange rates as the main shock absorber for volatile capital flows and thereby freeing monetary policy to provide liquidity for domestic structural adjustments.
This satisfied both Western economists and global financial markets, which breathed a collective sigh of relief when Chinese leaders reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining a stable renminbi.
The fear was that, if China sought a weaker exchange rate to escape deflation, the result would be another round of global competitive devaluations and even more deflation.
Fortunately, China’s leaders recognize that, if the world remains mired in a balance-sheet recession, the lack of aggregate demand, by continuing to weaken trade, will drag down their own country’s growth.
But, of course, China still needs to find a way to cope with capital outflows, while pursuing the structural reforms that are needed to place its economy on a sustainable long-term growth path.
As we recently argued, the key will be to maintain an annual growth rate of roughly 6.5%, while pursuing a multifaceted short-term stabilization plan that aims to stimulate job creation to offset the losses from restructuring inefficient industries and eliminating excess capacity.
Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) would face the unenviable task of both maintaining exchange-rate stability and combating deflation, by ensuring that the liquidity needed to support the shift away from manufacturing toward services and consumption is available at reasonable rates.
Given how much of its official reserves China has already spent stimulating the economy and stabilizing the exchange rate, as well as the size of capital outflows – equivalent to three times the current-account surplus last year – tactics like reducing reserve requirements would be key here.
The PBOC would, of course, have to tighten controls on foreign exchange.
But it is also contemplating other macro-prudential instruments, such as a kind of Tobin tax, the levy on financial transactions first suggested in 1972 by the Nobel laureate economist James Tobin, in order to discourage volatile capital flows.
All of this amounts to Plan A – an unavoidable strategy for stopping deflation in China.
But, in today’s multipolar global system, no single country can save the global economy from debt deflation.
That is why the world must also consider implementing a shared strategy; call it Plan B.
Of course, collective action will not be easy – not least because some measures, such as a global monetary or fiscal policy, were ruled out at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, where world leaders created the international economic and financial architecture that prevails today.
But, in the face of unprecedented threats to global economic stability, it may be time to convene another Bretton Woods-type conference to determine what collective measures are possible.
There is plenty of incentive for action.
With the advanced economies facing rapid population aging, large public-debt burdens, overstretched monetary policies, and fractious politics, the global economy’s capacity to escape its current rut depends largely on the emerging economies.
After all, while these economies are facing challenges of their own, they enjoy more favorable demographics and are experiencing rapid urbanization.
As a result, they have huge potential for productivity gains, which would strengthen global economic growth, and massive demand for sustainable infrastructure to reduce resource depletion and address global warming.
The main constraint on realizing the emerging economies’ potential is financial, with the Bretton Woods institutions unable to provide the needed capital.
If the world is to escape the debt-deflation trap – not to mention address rising income and wealth inequality – this must change.
The recent panic over the renminbi’s depreciation highlights another compelling reason for collective action.
In today’s world, nobody is safe from large and volatile capital flows – not even countries that have built up huge amounts of self-insurance in the form of foreign-exchange reserves.
In 2007-2009, the advanced economies managed to escape a liquidity crisis, largely because the US Federal Reserve was willing to engage in liquidity swaps with key central banks, mostly those of US allies.
Only with a global liquidity-insurance system – underpinned by multilateral currency-swap arrangements – can countries pursue much-needed reflation, without excessive fear of capital flight and/or exchange-rate devaluation.
Finally, collective action is needed to make unconventional monetary policy more effective.
Thus far, such policies have failed to revive the global economy largely because commercial banks and other lenders retained the liquidity they received from their central banks, instead of channeling it to the real economy by providing credit to small and medium-size enterprises and investing in long-term infrastructure projects.
It is no coincidence that from 2010 to 2014, the largest banks, firms, and investment funds increased their cash holdings by $3 trillion – roughly the amount by which central banks in reserve-currency countries expanded their balance sheets over the same period.
By enabling countries to eliminate excess capacity, reduce leverage, and balance tax policies – all while reducing geopolitical uncertainty – collective action to escape deflation and boost growth would mitigate financial institutions’ risk aversion, thereby improving the transmission mechanisms of unconventional monetary policies.
Reaching global consensus is always difficult. But, in today’s context, there is no avoiding it.
If countries continue to try to go it alone, the entire world will suffer.
The Global Cost of Domestic Violence
PRAGUE – Domestic violence costs the world 25 times more than war and terrorism, according to research conducted by James Fearon of Stanford University and Anke Hoeffler of Oxford University on behalf of the Copenhagen Consensus Center.
By looking at different kinds of violence, Fearon and Hoeffler find that the global costs of conflict – including the economic toll of deaths from wars and terrorism, refugee-related outlays, and general pecuniary damage – add up to around 0.2% of global GDP each year.
That figure is dwarfed by domestic violence.
The cost of domestic violence adds up to an astonishing 5.2% of global GDP each year.
Nevertheless, the amount of research and funding directed at solving the problem of domestic violence is tiny compared to what is spent in pursuit of international peace.
In recent years, domestic violence has come into sharper focus in India, where shocking stories of extreme brutality have made headlines around the world.
Because India is home to approximately one-fifth of the global population, finding scalable solutions to the problem there could have far-reaching implications for the rest of world.
Like many countries, India’s gender inequalities are deeply entrenched.
Yet, given the sheer size of its population, any meaningful reduction in domestic violence could transform millions of lives for generations to come.
The most recent National Family Health Survey conducted in India showed that 29% of married women aged 15-49 had experienced spousal physical or sexual violence.
That means that millions of Indian women will likely suffer domestic violence this year alone.
In the coastal state of Andhra Pradesh, the Copenhagen Consensus Center recently collaborated with Tata Trusts, one of India’s oldest philanthropies, to identify the best policy options for solving the state’s biggest challenges.
More than 30 researchers, including Nobel laureate Finn Kydland, examined a host of local issues ranging from the indebtedness of ultra-poor farmers to educational quality, tuberculosis rates, and adolescent mental health.
Among these important issues, two of the top-ten policies that we identified dealt with domestic violence.
Among the various approaches to tackling domestic violence, very few are backed by empirical evidence of effectiveness.
But new research from Srinivas Raghavendra, Mrinal Chadha, and Nata Duvvury of the National University of Ireland Galway have identified two proven approaches that involve not just a safety-net response to domestic violence, but also efforts to change public attitudes.
One approach is based on the SASA! project, which works with entire communities to raise awareness about how men’s use of power over women can both fuel violence against women and raise HIV/AIDS rates.
SASA! shows how individual communities themselves can reduce the social acceptability of violence.
The approach was pioneered in Uganda, and has now been used in more than 20 countries, at a cost of just $15 per person.
The other intervention, which has proved effective in South Africa, combines microfinance loans to women with training about domestic violence, gender norms, sexuality, and women’s rights.
While microfinance ensures that women have the practical means to support themselves, the additional training furnishes them with the means to improve their physical and emotional wellbeing.
Based on the evidence, the NUI Galway researchers find that these models could be adapted for Andhra Pradesh, where 1.7 million women aged 15-59 live below the poverty line and have been in a partnership within the past year.
(Domestic violence affects women of every income level, but these programs’ particular focus is on lower-income women.)
The total cost to administer these programs would be $23.5 million and $19.5 million, respectively.
Extrapolating from the results of a self-reported survey suggests that more than 500,000 of these 1.7 million women will be assaulted by a partner each year.
And, based on previous studies, each of these women will likely experience physical abuse not just once or twice, but eight times every year, on average.
Now, consider that both of the programs in question have been shown to reduce domestic violence by around 55%, and that the benefits are estimated to last at least four years. Either program on its own could save more than ten lives each year, while preventing a far greater number of physical injuries.
Moreover, the costs of abuse do not stop there.
Surveys show that each domestic assault incapacitates a woman for an average of around 5.5 days.
The economic costs of such violence, then, can be estimated by adding up the loss of paid work, along with the value of unpaid domestic work and free time.
Using this approach, the NUI Galway researchers show that reaching those 1.7 million women in Andhra Pradesh could create total benefits worth about $550 million.
Each dollar spent would produce more than $27 worth of social benefits, owing to the reduction in suffering.
These findings, along with other recommendations on education and nutrition policies, have been presented to Andhra Pradesh’s chief minister, Nara Chandrababu Naidu, who has requested an action plan.
The evidence indicates that many other Indian states and countries around the world could learn from Andhra Pradesh’s experience.
Future generations of women and girls would benefit, and so would the entire economy.
The Crisis of Our Crises
PRINCETON – At first glance, today’s major international crises seem to have little in common.
Some, such as Greece’s debt drama, are economic disasters; others, like Syria’s implosion, are characterized by brutality and political chaos; and still others, most notably Ukraine’s predicament, fall somewhere in between.
But, despite what policymakers might like to believe, these events are not unrelated.
On the contrary, they reflect a deeper crisis of international integration and cooperation.
Over the last 60 years, the world experienced unprecedented peace and prosperity for a simple reason: countries voluntarily integrated themselves into an international community underpinned by shared rules and norms.
But this trend has given way to piecemeal crisis responses, whether austerity or localized damage control, that are based on the unreasonable assumption that problems like those in Greece, Syria, and Ukraine will eventually correct themselves.
In relying on stopgap measures to address crises, global leaders seem to have forgotten how interdependent the world has become.
Upheaval or stagnation in one part of a complex system can have outsize consequences elsewhere, in the form of, say, a refugee crisis or an uptick in inequality.
For example, Europe’s malaise – which has persisted partly because its leaders have insisted on muddling through, rather than seeking comprehensive solutions – has had serious consequences for Ukraine, a country teetering on the edge of a meltdown.
By the end of this year, Ukraine’s economy is expected to be 15% smaller than it was 2013, and its debt-to-GDP ratio may be near 200%, exceeding Greece’s at its worst.
And the security situation in the eastern part of the country is deteriorating.
Creditors cannot be expected to be any more lenient with Ukraine than they have been with Greece, a member of the eurozone.
But a hard stance on Ukraine while it fights a war with Russia could threaten Europe’s strategic buffer from the Baltic to the Balkans.
The economist Albert O. Hirschman once said that a crisis can be either disintegrative or integrative.
Individuals and organizations, confronted with adversity and lacking faith in policymakers, can either “exit” from the institutions and societies that bind them, or rally together to revitalize them.
Unfortunately, today’s crises so far have seemed largely disintegrative.
Consider capital flight, which forced Greece to impose controls.
Of course, exit mechanisms like capital flight can have a positive impact.
In the eighteenth century, capital flight kept predatory rulers in check.
Adam Smith viewed the rise of movable capital as a force that would encourage enlightened public policies that serve the general interest.
But, in today’s interconnected world, capital can move much more quickly and to many more destinations, crossing borders with the click of a mouse.
Moreover, the global financial industry is largely autonomous, driven by self-interest, rather than a desire to advance the common good.
As we have seen in Europe since 2010, as well as in Ukraine and Puerto Rico more recently, the ability to rush for the exit at any time removes investors’ incentive to compromise.
As policymakers struggle to create a consensus around a reform agenda, the prospects of rejuvenating the pacts and policies underlying integration and cooperation deteriorate.
But the world order is by no means fated to devolve into chaos.
Today’s crisis of international integration can become the catalyst for the creation of a new or revitalized global system.
This has happened before.
Indeed, the current world order arose from the major crises of the Great Depression and World War II, with countries building the social pacts and economic institutions that would underpin peace and prosperity for the next several decades.
To ensure that a crisis produces such a constructive integrative response, policymakers must change their mindset.
Instead of seeing only problems that need to be contained, they should view crises as an opportunity for progress.
Today, some important integrative policies lie within reach.
On the economic front, policymakers should stop pouring public money into bailouts that benefit private creditors at the expense of taxpayers, and they should end austerity programs that kill growth prospects and do not address debt overhang.
They must also reform tax systems and improve cooperation to reduce tax evasion, using the added revenues to invest in physical infrastructure and education.
Such measures will create jobs today, and secure prosperity for tomorrow.
Political measures are also needed.
Europe needs a more democratic framework that keeps financiers at the negotiating table.
Similarly, with the possibility of admitting Ukraine to NATO a dead letter, the West should take steps to ease tensions with Russia, in order to ensure its continued participation in international efforts to address key threats (as it did when negotiating the recent agreement to rein in Iran’s nuclear program).
Muddling through can lead to only one outcome: disintegration.
Only when world leaders recognize the common source and the interconnectedness of current international crises will they be in a position to address them effectively.
Is It Time for Global Money?
NEW YORK – Today’s world is more economically and financially integrated than at any time since the latter half of the nineteenth century.
But policymaking – particularly central banking – remains anachronistically national and parochial.
Isn’t it time to re-think the global monetary (non)system?
In particular, wouldn’t a single global central bank and a world currency make more sense than our confusing, inefficient, and outdated assemblage of national monetary policies and currencies?
Technology is now reaching the point where a common digital currency, enabled by near-universal mobile phone adoption, certainly makes this possible.
And however farfetched a global currency may sound, recall that before World War I, ditching the gold standard seemed equally implausible.
The current system is both risky and inefficient.
Different monies are not only a nuisance for tourists who arrive home with pockets full of unspendable foreign coins.
Global firms waste time and resources on largely futile efforts to hedge currency risk (benefiting only the banks that act as middlemen).
The benefits of ridding the world of national currencies would be enormous.
In one fell swoop, the risk of currency wars, and the harm they can inflict on the world economy, would be eliminated.
Pricing would be more transparent, and consumers could spot anomalies (from their phones) and shop for the best deals.
And, by eliminating foreign-exchange transactions and hedging costs, a single currency would reinvigorate stalled world trade and improve the efficiency of global capital allocation.
In short, the current state of affairs is the by-product of the superseded era of the nation-state.
Globalization has shrunk the dimensions of the world economy, and the time for a world central bank has arrived.
Dream on.
A single world currency is in fact neither likely nor desirable.
Central banks, while ideally independent from political influence, are nonetheless accountable to the body politic.
They owe their legitimacy to the political process that created them, rooted in the will of the citizenry they were established to serve (and from which they derive their authority).
The history of central banking, though comparatively brief, suggests that democratically derived legitimacy is possible only at the level of the nation-state.
At the supra-national level, legitimacy remains highly questionable, as the experience of the eurozone amply demonstrates.
Only if the European Union’s sovereignty eclipses, by democratic choice, that of the nation-states that comprise it will the European Central Bank have the legitimacy it requires to remain the eurozone’s sole monetary authority.
But the same political legitimacy cannot be imagined for any transatlantic or trans-Pacific monetary authority, much less a global one.
Treaties between countries can harmonize rules governing commerce and other areas.
But they cannot transfer sovereignty over an institution as powerful as a central bank or a symbol as compelling as paper money.
Central banks’ legitimacy matters most when the stakes are highest.
Everyday monetary-policy decisions are, to put it mildly, unlikely to excite the passions of the masses.
The same cannot be said of the less frequent need (one hopes) for the monetary authority to act as lender of last resort to commercial banks and even to the government.
As we have witnessed in recent years, such interventions can be the difference between financial chaos and collapse and mere retrenchment and recession.
And only central banks, with their ability to create freely their own liabilities, can play this role.
Yet the tough decisions that central banks must make in such circumstances – preventing destabilizing runs versus encouraging moral hazard – are simultaneously technocratic and political.
Above all, the legitimacy of their decisions is rooted in law, which itself is the expression of democratic will.
Bail out one bank and not another?
Purchase sovereign debt but not state or commonwealth (for example, Puerto Rican) debt?
Though deciding such questions at a supranational level is not theoretically impossible, it is utterly impractical in the modern era.
Legitimacy, not technology, is the currency of central banks.
But the fact that a single global central bank and currency would fail spectacularly (regardless of how strong the economic case for it may be) does not absolve policymakers of their responsibility to address the challenges posed by a fragmented global monetary system.
And that means bolstering global multilateral institutions.
The International Monetary Fund’s role as independent arbiter of sound macroeconomic policy and guardian against competitive currency devaluation ought to be strengthened.
Finance ministers and central bankers in large economies should underscore, in a common protocol, their commitment to market-determined exchange rates.
And, as Raghuram Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, recently suggested, the IMF should backstop emerging economies that might face liquidity crises as a result of the normalization of US monetary policy.
Likewise, a more globalized world requires a commitment from all actors to improve infrastructure, in order to ensure the efficient flow of resources throughout the world economy.
To this end, the World Bank’s capital base in its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development should be increased along the lines of the requested $253 billion, to help fund emerging economies’ investments in highways, airports, and much else.
Multilateral support for infrastructure investment is not the only way global trade can be revived under the current monetary arrangements.
As was amply demonstrated in the last seven decades, reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers would also help – above all in agriculture and services, as envisaged by the Doha Round.
Global financial stability, too, can be strengthened within the existing framework.
All that is required is harmonized, transparent, and easy-to-understand regulation and supervision.
For today’s international monetary system, the perfect – an unattainable single central bank and currency – should not be made the enemy of the good.
Working within our existing means, it is surely possible to improve our policy tools and boost global growth and prosperity.
The Debt Dilemma
LONDON/WASHINGTON, DC – Greece’s divisive negotiations with the EU have placed debt back at the center of debates about economic growth and stability.
But Greece is not the only country struggling to repay its existing debt, much less dampen borrowing.
Its fraught negotiations with its creditors should spur other countries to take action to address their own debt overhangs.
Since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, the world’s debt has risen by $57 trillion, exceeding GDP growth.
Government debt has increased by $25 trillion, with the advanced economies accounting for $19 trillion – a direct result of severe recession, fiscal-stimulus programs, and bank bailouts.
While American households have reduced their debt considerably (mainly through mortgage defaults), household debt in many other countries has continued to grow rapidly.
In all major economies, the debt-to-GDP ratio (including both public and private debt) is higher today than it was in 2007.
Much of this debt accumulation was driven by efforts to support economic growth in the face of deflationary headwinds after the 2008 crisis.
That was especially so in China, which, together with other developing economies, accounts for nearly half of the debt incurred since 2008.
To be sure, debt itself is not bad.
But excessive reliance on debt creates the risk of financial crises, which undermine growth.
Given this, the world needs to find both less credit-intensive routes to growth and ways to eliminate existing debt burdens.
To help limit future debt accumulation, countries have three options.
First, they can employ countercyclical macroprudential measures to dampen credit cycles and prevent excessive borrowing.
For example, stricter loan-to-value-ratio limits and higher capital requirements for banks could slow credit growth when housing or commercial real-estate markets are overheating.
Yet precisely the opposite approach is now being taken in the United States, where some first-time homebuyers have now been given access to 97% loan-to-value mortgages.
A second strategy for curbing the buildup of debt could be to introduce mortgage contracts that enable more risk sharing between borrowers and lenders, essentially acting as debt/equity hybrids.
As the Great Recession grimly illustrated, when a period of soaring real-estate valuations and rising household debt is followed by a period of falling prices, and households attempt to deleverage, the results can be catastrophic.
The talent for financial innovation that produced harmful new home-mortgage options before the crash should now be harnessed to develop more flexible mortgages that help borrowers avoid default.
One example is “shared responsibility” mortgages, in which payments are reduced under certain circumstances, such as when home prices dip below the borrower’s purchase price.
In exchange for this flexibility, the lender receives a share of any capital gain that is realized when the home is sold.
Similarly, the continuous-workout mortgage adjusts payments and terms in specific cases, such as job loss.
A third option for limiting debt accumulation is to reconsider tax rules that favor debt.
In many countries, interest accrued on a mortgage remains tax deductible.
Though phasing out this policy is politically contentious, some countries – such as the United Kingdom in the 1980s – have managed to do so.
Similarly, it would be difficult – but not impossible – to reduce the incentives, created by almost all countries’ tax regimes, for corporate leverage.
Governments must also work to reduce existing debt – and the deficient global demand to which it contributes.
It is simply not feasible for the most highly leveraged governments to grow their way out of debt.
Nor can austerity alone suffice, as it would require countries to make such large fiscal adjustments – 5% of GDP, in Spain’s case – that citizens would likely resist them, as the Greeks have done.
A more effective approach would employ a broader range of tools, including debt restructuring.
In some countries, sales of public assets and the levying of one-off wealth taxes would also be helpful.
Investors, analysts, and other commentators, for their part, must take a more nuanced view of governments’ true debt liabilities.
Much of the sovereign-debt accumulation of recent years has been enabled by quantitative easing, with central banks making large-scale purchases of government bonds.
The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Japan now own 16%, 24%, and 22%, respectively, of all bonds outstanding.
Given that central banks are owned by the government, and that interest paid on outstanding bonds is remitted back to the national treasury, these government bonds are fundamentally different from those owned by other creditors.
Focusing on “net” government debt (which excludes intra-government debt holdings, such as the bonds owned by central banks) is a more effective approach to assessing and ensuring the sustainability of public debt.
The global economic crisis laid bare the challenge of debt reduction – and the risks that excessive indebtedness raises.
Yet the crisis also intensified government and household dependence on leverage, causing debt levels to continue to rise – a trend that, left unchecked, will lead to more crises in the future.
It is time to redirect financial innovation toward developing new tools and approaches to address these challenges.
Only then can the world economy move onto a sustainable growth path.
Global Disaster Recovery
PALO ALTO – With the global economy mired in recession and financial crisis, policymakers everywhere have launched a series of monetary, financial, and fiscal responses.
Nevertheless, economies continue to contract, unemployment to rise, and wealth to decline.
Countries’ policy responses have ranged from modest to immense.
China has undertaken a 6%-of-GDP stimulus package aimed (mostly) at infrastructure; the United States has enacted a two-year $800 billion spending and tax rebate package.
The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England lowered short-term interest-rate targets to near zero and are adopting “quantitative easing” – i.e., continuous infusions of money.
Despite all this, massive excess bank reserves remain unlent.
During Japan’s “lost decade,” the Bank of Japan mostly bought Japanese government bonds, whereas the Fed is trying to reopen secondary markets for securitized private lending (which in the US is as important as bank lending), buying mortgage-backed securities and consumer and business loans, as well as U.S. Treasury bonds.
The Bank of England is buying UK government bonds (“gilts”).
The European Central Bank, reflecting a strong inflation concern, has responded more slowly.
The US government is now insuring, lending or spending over $10 trillion from guaranteeing money market funds to the AIG bailout to the Fed’s swap lines supporting foreign central banks.
Analogous guarantees and bank bailouts have occurred in the other major economies (the ECB does not play this role for Europe; national governments do).
The fiscal response – tax cuts and spending increases – has varied considerably, being somewhat more tepid in debt-averse Europe than in the US and China.
The US is hectoring Europe for more fiscal stimulus, while the Europeans pressure the US for greater and more globally coordinated financial regulation.
Will near-zero interest rates, financial-sector bailouts, and fiscal stimulus work?
What else could be done?
As for fiscal measures, the empirical evidence suggests that three-quarters of consumption is based on longer-term economic prospects, not short-run disposable income.
Thus, temporary tax rebates are mostly saved, not spent.
Targeting liquidity-constrained people, especially the unemployed, is a bit more effective, as well as humane.
Some claim that infrastructure spending creates a big Keynesian “multiplier,” a bigger increase in incomes than the initial spending (estimates range up to about 1.5 times the initial increase in spending).
But infrastructure spending is usually slow – and almost always driven heavily by parochial political considerations.
Japan’s annual 15-20 trillion yen infrastructure-intensive stimulus didn’t prevent its lost decade.
Nor did American government spending end the Great Depression (unemployment was still over 15% in 1939, a decade after the depression’s onset).
A more effective stimulus would speed up spending that needs to be done anyway. Or cut taxes to change the marginal calculus of firms on layoffs and consumers on spending – for example, by suspending the payroll tax on firms and workers for a year or suspending part or all of the sales tax or national value-added tax.
Better yet would be permanent rate reductions and controls on future spending.
But governments should be wary of expensive fiscal stimulus.
It is likely to yield little cushion for employment and income per dollar spent, while servicing the large debt accumulation will impede long-run growth, either by forcing substantial future tax increases or spending cuts, or by forcing central banks to inflate.
Indeed, China frets over the safety of the US Treasury bonds that it holds.
In theory, enough quantitative easing implies future inflation, motivating people to buy big-ticket items, like cars and appliances, now to avoid the run-up in prices later.
(In practice, it is an experiment.)
High and rising inflation creates great costs and is difficult to reverse.
After mitigating the downturn, central bankers must withdraw the immense infusion of liquidity before inflation takes off, a tricky maneuver.
The bottom line, though, is that better policies can at best mitigate the economic consequences of this horrible recession.
We will not get out of this mess completely any time soon.
Sometimes, strong recoveries follow recessions, but recovery following financial crises is always immensely painful, time-consuming, and traumatic.
The economists Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart have argued that the major financial crises of the last century typically lasted a half-decade or longer.
In many of the previous banking crises, it was a country or a region that was hit hard (Argentina, Japan, etc.).
This time, virtually every economy is suffering substantially and the banking crisis is global.
Policymakers will continue to throw whatever ammunition they can find at the problem, but it will take time for the deleveraging from the boom to run its course.
At times of serious economic distress, policymakers thrash about seeking solutions, and some people lose confidence in the economic system itself.
Indeed, in the Great Depression of the 1930’s, it was common for Western intellectuals to turn to communism and central planning as a hoped-for panacea.
Some never returned from that intellectual journey, despite the collapse of communism.
There is, of course, no case for going back to socialism and central planning.
Once off government lifelines, we will need a better-regulated financial system.
Any financial institution that is too big or too interconnected to fail, or could quickly become so, must be closely regulated and monitored for risk and capital adequacy in real time, or be broken up into smaller firms.
In the meantime, let’s hope that Messrs. Bernanke, King, Trichet, and the world’s other central bank governors get monetary policy roughly right, and that our politicians don’t waste vast sums on ineffective fiscal stimulus.
A Global Strategy for Disaster Risk
SENDAI – Current disaster-risk levels are alarming.
The cost of damage to commercial and residential buildings worldwide is averaging $314 billion each year, with the private sector bearing as much as 85% of that price tag.
At the same time, a new United Nations report shows that annual investments in disaster-risk reduction of $6 billion can result in savings of up to $360 billion.
Hundreds of business executives, aware of the dramatic costs – and potential benefits – at stake, are now preparing to attend a UN conference on disaster-risk reduction in Sendai, Japan.
A decade ago, when the last such gathering was held, the private sector was scarcely represented.
This time, companies and entrepreneurs will be there in full force to explore a range of valuable opportunities.
The Tohoku region of Japan, where the meeting will take place, is a vivid reminder of how a disaster's economic impact reverberates far beyond its epicenter.
Devastated four years ago by the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, Japan's automobile production was cut by nearly half.
The financial damage did not stop at the country's borders; as a direct result of the slowdown in Japan, automobile production dropped by some 20% in Thailand, 50% in China, and 70% in India.
The risks inherent in globalized production carry great rewards for those who know how to manage them properly.
That is why major businesses such as PricewaterHouseCoopers, Hindustan Construction Corporation, AbzeSolar, Swiss Re, AECOM, AXA Group, IBM, and others – spanning many sectors and encompassing all regions – are engaging with UN experts to improve global strategies for disaster-risk management and reduction.
This level of business engagement bodes well for pioneering a new planet-friendly and people-sensitive approach to global prosperity.
Indeed, the disaster-risk reduction conference in Sendai is the first in a series of major international gatherings this year.
Beyond Sendai, world leaders will convene in Addis Ababa in July to discuss financing for development, in New York in September to adopt a new development agenda, and in Paris in December to reach a meaningful climate-change agreement.
Taken together, these meetings promise to generate transformative action that can set the world on a safer, more prosperous, and more sustainable path.
Sustainability starts in Sendai for three major reasons.
First, by its very nature, disaster-risk reduction requires forward planning.
Second, investment in this area advances both sustainable development and climate action.
And, third, helping those who are most vulnerable to disasters is the ideal starting point for the effort to aid all people by establishing universal targets for development and climate change.
Over the last 12 months, thousands of lives were saved in India, the Philippines, and elsewhere by improved weather forecasting, early-warning systems, and evacuation plans.
Advances in risk reduction that safeguard development gains and business investments must match this progress in disaster preparedness, and we must make wise choices that create greater opportunities in the future.
For example, experts estimate that 60% of the land that will be urbanized by 2030 has not yet been developed.
Enterprises that factor disaster risk into their construction plans will avert the much higher costs of retrofitting later.
More broadly, over the next 15 years, the world will make major investments in urban infrastructure, energy, and agriculture.
If this spending is directed toward low-carbon goods, technologies, and services, we will be on our way to creating more resilient societies.
More and more industries appreciate this.
At the Climate Summit that I convened last September at the UN in New York, financial institutions, commercial and national banks, insurance companies, and pension funds vowed to mobilize more than $200 billion by the end of this year for action to address climate change.
They envisioned a host of new initiatives, including issuing so-called green bonds and shifting assets to clean-energy portfolios.
In a particularly important move, the insurance industry, representing $30 trillion in assets and investments, committed to creating a Climate Risk Investment Framework for industry-wide adoption by the end of the year.
It is time to stop addressing development and humanitarian emergencies separately.
Disaster-risk reduction lies at the nexus of development assistance, which seeks to advance better living conditions, and humanitarian aid, which begins after a disaster hits.
Starting our international calendar with the Sendai meeting on disaster-risk reduction sends a clear signal that the world is ready to integrate its strategies.
I have seen the human toll of disasters – from earthquakes in China and Haiti to floods in Pakistan and Bangladesh to Superstorm Sandy, which affected the Caribbean and North America, even inundating the lower floors of the UN facilities in New York.
When business, civil society, and government team up to help countries withstand disasters, they save lives, boost stability, and create opportunities that enable markets and people alike to flourish.
Sustainable profits.
Sustainable livelihoods.
Sustainable development.
It all starts in Sendai.
Preempting the Next Pandemic
SYRACUSE – Recent disease outbreaks, like Ebola and Zika, have demonstrated the need to anticipate pandemics and contain them before they emerge.
But the sheer diversity, resilience, and transmissibility of deadly diseases have also highlighted, in the starkest of terms, just how difficult containment and prevention can be.
One threat to our preparedness is our connectedness.
It was thanks to easy international travel that in recent years the dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses were all able to hitch a ride from east to west, causing massive outbreaks in the Americas and Caribbean.
Another threat is more mundane: failing to agree about money.
Whatever the reason, the fact is that as long as humans fail to organize a collective and comprehensive defense, infectious diseases will continue to wreak havoc – with disastrous consequences.
Building an effective prevention and containment strategy – being bio-prepared – is the best way to reduce the threat of a global contagion.
Preparedness requires coordination among agencies and funders to build networks that enable quick deployment of and access to vaccines, drugs, and protocols that limit a disease’s transmission.
Simply stated, preparing for the next pandemic means not only building global capacity, but also paying for it.
That’s the idea, at least.
The reality of bio-preparedness is far more complicated.
For starters, the absence of dedicated funding is impeding implementation of long-term prevention strategies in many countries; a new World Bank report finds that only six countries, including the United States, have taken the threat seriously.
Meanwhile, public health officials in many parts of the world struggle to respond to disease outbreaks, owing to a dearth of labs and clinics.
And many funding agencies, including governments and NGOs, typically offer only one-year commitments, which rules out long-term planning.
For years, scientists, physicians, and civil-society actors have voiced concern over the lack of reliable, meaningful, and institutionalized investment in pandemic preparedness.
These pleas have come, frustratingly, as military funding to thwart bio-attacks, consciously mounted by human actors, has remained robust.
But while purposeful and nefarious infectious-disease outbreaks could do massive damage, they remain relatively unlikely.
Naturally occurring outbreaks, by contrast, occur regularly and are far more costly, even if they lack the sensational “fear factor” of bioterrorism.
Not that long ago, those of us engaged in the prevention of infectious-disease outbreaks felt more secure about the availability of the resources required to prepare.
But in many places, budgets are stagnating, or even declining.
This is astonishingly shortsighted, given the relative costs of prevention versus response.
For example, what would it have cost to build the clinical and laboratory infrastructure and provide the training needed to identify and prevent the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa?
Precise figures are elusive, but I have no doubt it would have been less than the billions of dollars spent on containment.
Preparedness pays.
It is not only the lack of funding that is raising alarms; so are restrictions on how available funds can be used.
It is not uncommon for a grant to be restricted to specific activities, leaving major gaps in a program’s capacity to meet its objectives.
A funder may, for example, allow the renovation of an existing lab but not the construction of a new one; or funds may support the purchase of a diagnostic machine but not the training of those required to operate it.
In many developing countries, communities do not even have the physical buildings in which to test, monitor, or store dangerous pathogens.
Myopic funding that overlooks key elements of the big picture is money poorly spent.
Add to these challenges the difficulty of paying staff or ensuring reliable electricity and other essential services, and it becomes clear that preparing for disease outbreaks requires broad engagement with the international aid community.
But at the moment, onerous spending rules and weak financial commitments are tying the hands of those working to prevent the next serious disease outbreak.
The number of obstacles faced by scientists and public health experts in the race to contain deadly infectious diseases is staggering.
To overcome them, we need to redefine how we think about preparedness, moving from a reactive position to a more proactive approach.
Money earmarked for preparedness must be allocated at levels sufficient to have the required impact.
Limitations on how it can be spent should be loosened.
Funding sources must be opened to allow for multi-year commitments.
Health-care providers and first responders must receive proper training.
And long-term solutions such as establishing and connecting bio-surveillance systems should be expanded and strengthened, to enable public-health professionals around the world to track and report human and animal diseases and plan defenses together.
Public health is an essential element of global security.
Failing to invest appropriately in prevention of infectious-disease outbreaks puts all of us at risk, whenever or wherever the next one occurs.
Global Economic Cooperation or Bust
According to estimates by the United Nations, the global economy expanded by 3.8% last year, continuing the strong performance recorded since 2003.
Led by China and India, developing countries were prominent among the best performing economies, expanding by 6.5% on average in 2006.
But can this apparently benign pattern of global growth be sustained, particularly since growth has been accompanied by ever-widening global financial imbalances?
Average annual growth in the least developed countries, many in Africa, reached almost 7% last year.
The world’s largest economy, the United States, expanded by 3.2 %, and growth also recovered in previously sluggish Japan and Europe.
These trends are remarkable in light of the shocks from the surge in oil prices, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, international terrorism, and the breakdown of multilateral trade negotiations.
Strong economic performance reflects strong domestic demand in the US, owing to low borrowing costs and rising asset prices.
This lifted manufactured exports around the world and kept inflation down, which in turn boosted demand for energy and raw materials from the developing world, pushing up commodity prices and benefiting many poor countries.
The savings generated in East Asia and the major oil exporters have increased global liquidity, helping to finance the US current account deficit, which has now reached unprecedented levels.
But the outlook for 2007 is for weakening global economic growth.
The UN’s World Economic Situation and Prospects 2007 cautions that a weaker housing market will undermine US growth.
Consequently, global economic expansion will slow, as no other major country is set to take over as the main engine of growth.
With slowing world economic growth, US financing needs could cause a drop in investors’ confidence in the future of US-based assets, precipitating a sharp dollar depreciation.
The UN report observes that national economic policies and existing multilateral settings are not designed to mitigate effectively the risk of a global slowdown or to address global imbalances.
In Europe and Japan, for example, monetary and fiscal policies have been tightening in response to domestic concerns, further slowing the world economy.
The build-up of official reserves in East Asia and other developing countries will provide them with extra means to deal with possible external shocks.
However, it has also limited the expansion of domestic demand and import growth, exacerbating rather than redressing the global imbalances.
Of course, no single government can bear all the costs of the policies needed to correct today’s global imbalances.
But an internationally agreed set of policies could help reduce the risk of weaker growth in the major economies, maintain confidence in the stability of international financial markets, and avoid a hard landing for the dollar.
This would require, for instance, stimulating growth in Europe, Asia, and the major oil exporters in order to offset the contractionary effect on the world economy of adjustment in the US, which should include more restrictive fiscal policies, less private consumption, and higher domestic savings to reduce its external deficit.
Exchange rates should be realigned in a coordinated fashion to stimulate exports from deficit countries and import demand from surplus countries.
This is not just a matter of revaluing the Chinese currency, as argued by some US policymakers, but requires gradual adjustment of most major currencies against the dollar in conjunction with concerted fiscal and monetary policy adjustments in the rest of the world.
Existing platforms, such as the G-8 summits, are unsuitable to achieve this course of action, mainly because key players from the developing world are not included.
The multilateral surveillance mechanisms launched last year by the IMF are a step in the right direction, but only if they become part of an institutionalized multilateral mechanism of surveillance and policy coordination.
To be credible as a mediator of this mechanism, the IMF itself would need reform, including a substantial change of voting power to bring the influence of developing countries in line with the weight they carry nowadays in the global economy.
Modest steps in that direction were taken during the IMF meetings in Singapore last September.
Such a new platform should also be used to work towards structural reform of the international monetary system aimed at reducing its excessive reliance on the US dollar as a reserve currency.
Such reforms should work towards developing a multilaterally agreed multi-currency reserve system or even, in the longer term, a world currency based on the Special Drawing Rights issued by the IMF.
The mere possibility of an imminent hard landing for the dollar – and with it, for the US and world economy – should be alarming enough to mobilize concerted action.
Coordination will surely deliver more satisfactory outcomes than what any one country can achieve on its own.
Try Everything
BERKELEY – When it became clear in late 2008 that the global economy was headed toward a crash at least as dangerous as the one that had initiated the Great Depression, I was alarmed, but also hopeful.
We had, after all, seen this before.
And we also had a model for how to mitigate the damage; unfortunately, policymakers left it on the shelf.
For three and a half years following the start of the Great Depression, US President Herbert Hoover’s top priority was to balance the budget, trying – but ultimately failing – to restore business confidence.
In 1933, newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt changed course, adopting a simple yet radical strategy: try everything that might boost demand, increase production, or reduce unemployment – and then keep doing the things that work.
Roosevelt abandoned attempts to balance the budget, increased the money supply, and initiated deficit spending.
He took the United States off the gold standard, had the government hire workers directly, and offered loan guarantees to those in danger of losing their homes.
He cartelized the oil industry and instituted aggressive antitrust policies to break up monopolies.
To be sure, Roosevelt’s New Deal policies sometimes conflicted with one another, and quite a few of them were counterproductive.
But, by trying everything, and then scaling up the most successful policies, Roosevelt was ultimately able to turn the economy around.
And so, in late 2008, the way forward seemed obvious: recapitalize the banks, guarantee loans, use the government-backed housing lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to resolve underwater mortgages, drop short-term interest rates to zero and use quantitative easing to prevent deflation or dangerously low inflation, and embrace deficit spending.
Then, as events evolved, we would reinforce those policies that seemed to be working and gradually drop those that seemed to be ineffective or counterproductive.
But that was not what we did.
Instead, each proposal faced its own opposition.
Some worried that recapitalizing the banks would reward the very institutions that had caused the problem.
Others fretted that resolving underwater mortgages would reward feckless borrowers.
Still others raised concerns about expansionary fiscal and monetary policy.
And some favored one set of polices (say, resolving underwater mortgages and recapitalizing the banks), while opposing all the others (for example, deficit spending and raising inflation expectations).
Six years on, the economy has yet to fully recover and the problem persists.
In an article published on Christmas Day in the Wall Street Journal, the usually wise economist Martin Feldstein makes the case for a set of policies designed to stimulate demand, including increasing investment tax credits and shifting the corporate-tax burden to firms that do not spend very much.
Feldstein’s ideas are promising; and, in line with the lessons of the Great Depression, they are definitely worth trying.
The trouble is the rhetoric surrounding his proposals.
The article’s headline, “The Fed’s Needless Flirtation With Danger,” is followed by warnings that quantitative easing could “increase the risk of financial instability.”
Instead of simply promoting his policies, Feldstein presents them as a “safe and effective alternative” to other approaches.
His proposals, he argues, are not an additional arrow in the quiver, but replacements for “traditional Keynesian policies…[that] increase budget deficits and national debt.”
The result is that Feldstein’s contribution to solving our economic difficulties is, at best, unproductive.
Though he presumably hopes that his commentary will increase the likelihood that his preferred policies are adopted, the more likely real-world effect will be to diminish support for existing policies without marshaling support for a coalition that can implement effective replacements.
I would be remiss if I did not note that I have sometimes been part of the problem.
When I look back at everything I have written since 2008, I find that I, too, have sometimes been too ready to push my favorite recipes at the expense of others.
As policymakers continue to seek a path out of the ongoing malaise, it would be wise to remember Roosevelt’s words before he led the US out of a very similar crisis.
“The country needs and…demands bold, persistent experimentation,” he said in 1932.
“Take a method and try it.
If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another.
But above all, try something.”
The Global Economy’s Surprising Resilience
LONDON – Disconcerting political developments in the United States and the United Kingdom might lead one to conclude that an already challenged world economy will struggle even more in the near term.
But as we continue into 2017, the cyclical evidence actually suggests otherwise.
Since my days as Chief Economist at Goldman Sachs, I have kept an eye on six indicators from around the world that, taken together, provide a reliable snapshot of what the global economy will look like for the next six months.
Right now, all six indicators show more promise than they have for some time, and only one of them has fallen slightly from a recent high.
The first indicator is weekly unemployment claims in the US, from which one can gauge the overall strength of the US economy.
Economists are rightly trained to treat unemployment as a lagging indicator, but these data can also be useful in forecasting the near future.
US jobless claims are always up to date, because they are produced weekly, and statistical evidence suggests that they are a leading indicator for US equity prices.
As of last week, jobless claims remained rather low, as they have for some time, which bodes well for US stock markets.
Similarly, the Institute for Supply Management Manufacturing Index provides a pretty good preview of the US economy for the next 3-6 months, even though manufacturing comprises a relatively small share of GDP.
Like the latest jobless claims, the ISM’s numbers are currently giving cause for optimism.
A third indicator is a subcomponent of the same ISM survey: manufacturers’ new orders and inventories.
Currently, new orders are increasing and inventories are low, which suggests that businesses will have to produce more in the coming months to satisfy those orders.
Looking beyond the US, a fourth indicator is the ratio of Chinese retail spending relative to industrial production (adjusted for inflation).
These figures give us a glimpse of both cyclical trends and China’s structural rebalancing away from exports and toward domestic consumption.
This will arguably be one of the most important indicators for both China and the rest of the global economy for years to come.
The ratio of Chinese monthly retail sales to industrial production, while erratic, has been slowly trending higher since 2008, and there appears to have been another uptick in consumption recently.
This is why I am less worried than others about frequently cited risks confronting the Chinese economy.
Chinese consumer spending has remained strong despite the slowdown in industrial output and investment and the government’s efforts to constrain spending on luxury goods.
Some might object that Chinese data cannot be trusted.
But I do not see why the data on one side of the ratio would be any more or less reliable than data on the other side.
Why would Chinese officials fiddle with consumption data while allowing the industrial-output figures to register a decline.
In any case, we have to work with what we have.
A fifth indicator is South Korean trade data, which is consistently reported on the first day of each month after trades occur – faster than any other country.
South Korea has an open economy and trading partners around the world, including the US, China, Japan, and the European Union, so one can extrapolate from its trade data to draw conclusions about the state of global trade.
After trending down in recent years, South Korean trade since November has shown signs of recovering, notably in terms of export growth; and in January, it bounced back significantly.
To be sure, this finding is at odds with all of the eulogies for globalization that one hears these days, and Donald Trump’s decidedly protectionist administration in the US could now send global trade into a long retreat.
But South Korea’s recent data suggest that globalization still has some life left in it, and that 2017 is off to a decent start.
In fact, barring the worst-case scenario under Trump, it is possible that the slowdown in global trade in recent years will turn out to be a temporary phenomenon.
It may have been a singular occurrence that reflected a variety of factors, including the euro crisis; continued economic weakness in many European countries; the sharp decline in commodity prices; dramatic slowdowns in Brazil, Russia, and other emerging economies; and tighter regulations for international banks, which might have hindered trade finance.
The last key indicator is the monthly Ifo Business Climate Index in Germany, which contains useful cyclical data for Europe overall, owing to Germany’s centrality in the continent’s economy.
The Ifo survey has reported positive results in recent months, although the data were more promising in December than in January.
Taken together, these six indicators suggest to me that the global economy might now be growing at a rate of more than 4%.
This is the fastest growth in a number of years – although the last decade’s average growth rate of 3.3% was barely lower than the rate in the previous decade – and close to the pace of the previous two decades before that.
At the same time, the six indicators cannot tell us anything about what will happen after the next few months.
It is an open question whether global economic growth will remain strong, strengthen further, or start to weaken.
It has been interesting to watch growth accelerate in the face of shocks such as the UK’s Brexit referendum and Trump’s election.
And yet it is unclear why this is happening.
Some might say the trend is a result of policy decisions in the US and the UK, but far more would probably say that it is happening despite those decisions.
Unfortunately, there are no indicators that provide an answer to this question – only time will tell.
New Year’s Resolutions for the Global Economy
STANFORD – Over the last year, global growth has been anemic – and the forecast is only slightly better for 2016.
Something must be done to boost incomes and expand opportunities for people everywhere.
Here are some economic resolutions that could bring good cheer in the new year and beyond.
Let us begin in Europe.
Despite the European Central Bank’s monetary accommodation, a sharp depreciation of the euro, and negative short-term interest rates, the European economy remains in the doldrums.
In 2016, Europe’s leaders must stop expecting monetary policy to solve their problems, and instead pursue faster, firmer resolutions to the myriad crises they face, from the intertwined growth, banking, currency, and governance crises to the escalating refugee crisis, which is threatening free movement across internal borders.
They must pursue supply-side fiscal, structural, labor-market, and regulatory reforms, with common-sense solutions for the struggling periphery economies’ fiscal crises and the stronger economies’ medium-term debt woes topping the agenda.
In Latin America, the situation is more varied.
After a decade of progress (with some exceptions, notably Venezuela), the region is facing serious challenges, stemming partly from a sharp decline in global commodity prices.
Indeed, plummeting oil prices helped to push the region’s largest economy, Brazil, into its worst recession in decades, while a major corruption scandal at Petrobras, the state oil company, has thrown the country’s politics into disarray, with President Dilma Rousseff now facing impeachment.
This makes the pursuit of economy-saving resolutions exceedingly difficult.
The new leftist finance minister will probably make things worse.
Political instability is undermining economic prospects elsewhere, too.
In Ecuador, where President Rafael Correa, who seems intent on imitating Venezuelan Chavismo, has eliminated term limits on his office, high inflation is a growing risk.
In Latin America’s second- and third-largest economies, however, new leadership offers reason for hope.
President Enrique Peña Nieto’s decision to open Mexico’s deep-water oil deposits to international energy companies will help the country overcome declining production, lagging technology, and corruption at Pemex, the national oil company.
Nieto also recognizes the imperative of improving Mexico’s education system, and thus is taking on the powerful teachers’ union.
In Argentina, newly elected President Mauricio Macri is nothing like his anti-business, anti-American predecessor Cristina Kirchner, who pillaged the central bank, channeling funds toward favored local governments, and even fudged national statistics to obscure skyrocketing inflation.
Among Macri’s resolutions are market-oriented reforms, and clearing the many economic land mines that Kirchner planted.
He is off to a good start, having freed the peso from its official peg, reduced taxes, and moved toward freer trade.
Venezuela also has reason for hope.
The opposition, having won a supermajority in parliament, defeating the ruling socialists for the first time in 17 years, should be able to limit the harm caused by the policies of President Nicolás Maduro, heir to Hugo Chávez.
But if opposition forces are to turn the economy around, they will need to win the presidency in 2019.
In Asia, all eyes are on China, the epicenter of a growth slowdown that has reverberated throughout the region (and beyond).
The remarkable growth spurt of the last three decades has degraded the natural environment considerably, produced vast excess capacity in basic industries like cement and steel, and left the banking system saddled with bad loans.
China’s government has committed to reform, but its efforts are lagging.
The rebalancing of its economy from exports to domestic demand remains a major challenge, not least because its consumers are slow to cooperate.
And the government maintains significant control over major companies, even some that are listed on public stock markets.
To engineer the soft landing that Asia needs, China’s leaders must redouble their reform efforts.
One key resolution should be to dispense state-owned companies’ profits directly to the population, to consume the proceeds or invest them elsewhere.
Japan, for its part, has sunk back into recession, despite Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s large and costly economic-revitalization strategy.
The Japanese, like many of their neighbors, hope that enactment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal – which would, among other things, lower tariffs on thousands of commodities and reduce non-tariff barriers – will provide a much-needed boost.
Africa has been a less visible success story in the last decade.
Despite the many difficulties the continent faces, foreign investment and trade (not aid) provide major opportunities for growth and development.
A resolution to break the scientifically illiterate opposition to genetically modified food would help boost agriculture and exports to Europe substantially.
In North America, Canada’s new center-left prime minister, Justin Trudeau, will be tempted to expand government spending and regulation. But he must not loosen the strings of the public purse too much.
Thanks to the collapse in oil prices, western Canada is in the early stages of a serious downturn.
Fortunately, there is room for Trudeau to meet the demands of his supporters, without wasteful spending.
To this end, he should press America’s next president to pursue the implementation of the TPP in a way that protects NAFTA; to maintain a sound monetary policy; and to reverse President Barack Obama’s veto of the Keystone Pipeline.
These steps would also be in the interest of the United States.
In fact, US efforts to promote free trade should go beyond the TPP to target the revitalization of the moribund Doha Round of multilateral trade liberalization.
Both monetary- and fiscal-policy normalization are critical.
And the US must capitalize on its expanded energy production, such as by enabling exports of oil and natural gas, to reduce its European allies’ dependence on Russian energy.
But perhaps America’s most important New Year’s resolution should be to return to global leadership – a role that has gradually eroded over the last decade, with devastating consequences.
That erosion, rooted in deep political fissures that are evident in the current presidential election campaign, is disturbing global economic, financial, and security arrangements that depend on American leadership.
The US may have a lot on its plate, but unless it leads effectively, the challenges it faces will only grow.
Three Scenarios for the Global Economy
NEW YORK – For the last few years, the global economy has been oscillating between periods of acceleration (when growth is positive and strengthening) and periods of deceleration (when growth is positive but weakening).
After over a year of acceleration, is the world headed toward another slowdown, or will the recovery persist?
The current upswing in growth and equity markets has been going strong since the summer of 2016.
Despite a brief hiccup after the Brexit vote, the acceleration endured not just Donald Trump’s election as US president, but also the heightening policy uncertainty and geopolitical chaos that he has generated.
In response to this apparent resilience, the International Monetary Fund, which in recent years had characterized global growth as the “new mediocre,” recently upgraded its World Economic Outlook.
Will the recent growth spurt continue over the next few years?
Or is the world experiencing a temporary cyclical upswing that will soon be subdued by new tail risks, like those that have triggered other slowdowns in recent years?
It is enough to recall the summer of 2015 and early 2016, when investor fears of a Chinese hard landing, an excessively fast exit from zero policy rates by the US Federal Reserve, a stall in US GDP growth, and low oil prices conspired to undercut growth.
One can envision three possible scenarios for the global economy in the next three years or so.
In the bullish scenario, the world’s four largest, systemically important economies – China, the eurozone, Japan, and the United States – implement structural reforms that boost potential growth and address financial vulnerabilities.
By ensuring that the cyclical upswing is associated with stronger potential and actual growth, such efforts would produce robust GDP growth, low but moderately rising inflation, and relative financial stability for many more years.
US and global equity markets would reach new heights, justified by stronger fundamentals.
In the bearish scenario, the opposite happens: the world’s major economies fail to implement structural reforms that boost potential growth.
Rather than using this month’s National Congress of the Communist Party as a catalyst for reform, China kicks the can down the road, continuing on a path of excessive leverage and overcapacity.
The eurozone fails to achieve greater integration, while political constraints limit national policymakers’ ability to implement growth-enhancing structural reforms.
And Japan remains stuck on its low-growth trajectory, as supply-side reforms and trade liberalization – the third “arrow” of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic strategy – fizzle out.
As for the US, the Trump administration, in this scenario, continues to pursue a policy approach – including a tax cut that overwhelmingly favors the rich, trade protectionism, and migration restrictions – that may well reduce potential growth.
Excessive fiscal stimulus leads to runaway deficits and debt, which results in higher interest rates and a stronger dollar, further weakening growth.
Trigger-happy Trump could even end up in a military conflict with North Korea – and, later, Iran – diminishing America’s economic prospects further.
In this scenario, the lack of reform in major economies will leave the cyclical upswing constrained by low trend growth.
If potential growth remains low, easy monetary and credit policies could eventually lead to goods and/or asset inflation, eventually causing an economic slowdown – and possibly an outright recession and financial crisis – when asset bubbles burst or inflation rises.
The third – and, in my view, most likely – scenario lies somewhere between the first two.
The cyclical upswing, in both growth and equity markets, continues for a while, driven by the remaining tailwinds.
Yet, while major economies pursue some structural reforms to improve potential growth, the pace of change is much slower, and its scope more modest, than is needed to maximize potential.
In China, this muddle-through scenario means doing just enough to avoid a hard landing, but not enough to achieve a truly soft one; with financial vulnerabilities left unaddressed, distress becomes all but inevitable over time.
In the eurozone, this scenario would entail only nominal progress toward greater integration, with Germany’s continued rejection of true risk-sharing or fiscal union weakening incentives for struggling member countries to undertake tough reforms.
In Japan, an increasingly ineffective Abe administration would implement minimal reforms, leaving potential growth stuck below 1%.
In the US, Trump’s presidency would remain volatile and ineffective, with a growing number of Americans realizing that, despite his populist pretense, Trump is merely a plutocrat protecting the interests of the rich.
Inequality rises; the middle class stagnates; wages barely grow; and consumption and growth remain anemic, at barely close to 2%.
But the risks of muddling through extend far beyond mediocre economic performance.
This scenario represents not a stable equilibrium, but an unstable disequilibrium, vulnerable to economic, financial, and geopolitical shocks.
When such shocks eventually emerge, the economy will be tipped into a slowdown or, if the shock is large enough, even recession and financial crisis.
In other words, if the world does simply muddle through, as seems likely, it could, within three or four years, face a more bearish outlook.
The lesson is clear: either political leaders and policymakers demonstrate the leadership needed to secure a better medium-term outlook, or downside risks will materialize before long – and do serious damage to the global economy.
The Global Economy’s Marshmallow Test
NEW YORK – The world economy is experiencing a turbulent start to 2016.
Stock markets are plummeting; emerging economies are reeling in response to the sharp decline in commodities prices; refugee inflows are further destabilizing Europe; China’s growth has slowed markedly in response to a capital-flow reversal and an overvalued currency; and the US is in political paralysis.
A few central bankers struggle to keep the world economy upright.
To escape this mess, four principles should guide the way.
First, global economic progress depends on high global saving and investment.
Second, saving and investment flows should be viewed as global, not national.
Third, full employment depends on high investment rates that match high saving rates.
Fourth, high private investments by business depend on high public investments in infrastructure and human capital.
Let’s consider each.
First, our global goal should be economic progress, meaning better living conditions worldwide.
Indeed, that goal has been enshrined in the new Sustainable Development Goals adopted last September by all 193 members of the United Nations.
Progress depends on a high rate of global investment: building the skills, technology, and physical capital stock to propel standards of living higher.
In economic development, as in life, there’s no free lunch: Without high rates of investment in know-how, skills, machinery, and sustainable infrastructure, productivity tends to decline (mainly through depreciation), dragging down living standards.
High investment rates in turn depend on high saving rates.
A famous psychological experiment found that young children who could resist the immediate temptation to eat a marshmallow, and thereby gain two marshmallows in the future, were likelier to thrive as adults than those who couldn’t.
Likewise, societies that defer instant consumption in order to save and invest for the future will enjoy higher future incomes and greater retirement security.
(When American economists advise China to boost consumption and cut saving, they are merely peddling the bad habits of American culture, which saves and invests far too little for America’s future.)
Second, saving and investment flows are global.
A country such as China, with a high saving rate that exceeds local investment needs, can support investment in other parts of the world that save less, notably low-income Africa and Asia.
China’s population is aging rapidly, and Chinese households are saving for retirement.
The Chinese know that their household financial assets, rather than numerous children or government social security, will be the main source of their financial security.
Low-income Africa and Asia, on the other hand, are both capital-poor and very young.
They can borrow from China’s high savers to finance a massive and rapid build-up of education, skills, and infrastructure to underpin their own future economic prosperity.
Third, a high global saving rate does not automatically translate into a high investment rate; unless properly directed, it can cause underspending and unemployment instead.
Money put into banks and other financial intermediaries (such as pension and insurance funds) can finance productive activities or short-term speculation (for example, consumer loans and real estate).
Great bankers of the past like J.P. Morgan built industries like rail and steel.
Today’s money managers, by contrast, tend to resemble gamblers or even fraudsters like Charles Ponzi.
Fourth, today’s investments with high social returns – such as low-carbon energy, smart power grids for cities, and information-based health systems – depend on public-private partnerships, in which public investment and public policies help to spur private investment.
This has long been the case: Railroad networks, aviation, automobiles, semiconductors, satellites, GPS, hydraulic fracturing, nuclear power, genomics, and the Internet would not exist but for such partnerships (typically, but not only, starting with the military).
Our global problem today is that the world’s financial intermediaries are not properly steering long-term saving into long-term investments.
The problem is compounded by the fact that most governments (the US is a stark case) are chronically underinvesting in long-term education, skill training, and infrastructure.
Private investment is falling short mainly because of the shortfall of complementary public investment.
Shortsighted macroeconomists say the world is under-consuming; in fact, it is underinvesting.
The result is inadequate global demand (global investments falling short of global saving at full employment) and highly volatile short-term capital flows to finance consumption and real estate.
Such short-term flows are subject to abrupt reversals of size and direction.
The 1997 Asian financial crisis followed a sudden stop of capital inflows to Asia, and global short-term lending suddenly dried up after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, causing the Great Recession.
Now China is facing the same problem, with inflows having abruptly given way to outflows.
The mainstream macroeconomic advice to China – boost domestic consumption and overvalue the renminbi to cut exports – fails the marshmallow test.
It encourages overconsumption, underinvestment, and rising unemployment in a rapidly aging society, and in a world that can make tremendous use of China’s high saving and industrial capacity.
The right policy is to channel China’s high saving to increased investments in infrastructure and skills in low-income Africa and Asia.
China’s new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and its One Belt, One Road initiative to establish modern transport and communications links throughout the region are steps in the right direction.
These programs will keep China’s factories operating at high capacity to produce the investment goods needed for rapid growth in today’s low-income countries.
China’s currency should be allowed to depreciate so that China’s capital-goods exports to Africa and Asia are more affordable.
More generally, governments should expand the role of national and multilateral development banks (including the regional development banks for Asia, Africa, the Americas, and the Islamic countries) to channel long-term saving from pension funds, insurance funds, and commercial banks into long-term public and private investments in twenty-first-century industries and infrastructure.
Central banks and hedge funds cannot produce long-term economic growth and financial stability.
Only long-term investments, both public and private, can lift the world economy out of its current instability and slow growth.
The Economic Consequences of Drug Resistance
LONDON – When British Prime Minister David Cameron asked me in July to lead an effort to find solutions to the growing global problem of antimicrobial resistance, my first question was: “What is that?”
I soon learned that, as bacteria and parasites develop resistance to existing drugs, like antibiotics and antimalarial medications, the world is at risk of losing its battle against infectious diseases.
So my next question was: “Why me?
Don’t you need a scientist?”
It turns out that the problem of rising antimicrobial resistance is as much about economics as it is about science or medicine.
Left unchecked, it will kill millions of people every year, and have serious adverse economic consequences for the world.
For developing economies, including most of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) and MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Turkey) countries, the risk is particularly large.
Recent research, by an independent review on antimicrobial resistance, which I chair, has modeled the phenomenon’s likely impact on the world economy.
It suggests that if we fail to address antimicrobial resistance, the problem will grow worse.
By 2020, if we allow resistance to rise by 40%, global GDP will be 0.5% smaller than it otherwise would have been.
By 2030, it will be 1.4% smaller.
By 2050, the economic shortfall will reach 3%.
The accumulated loss of global output over the next 35 years will total $100 trillion – more than one and a half times annual world GDP today.
Already, 60,000 people die every year from causes related to antimicrobial resistance in the United States and Europe – some ten times the worldwide death toll from the ongoing Ebola crisis.
By 2050, if the problem is allowed to continue to grow, antimicrobial resistance will kill more than ten million people per year.
That is more than the number of people who currently die of cancer, and greater than the number of deaths from diabetes, lung cancer, road traffic accidents, diarrhoeal disease, and HIV combined.
The economic costs from the resulting panic, including a collapse of travel and trade, could be devastating.
Rising rates of antimicrobial resistance will have a particularly severe impact on India, Indonesia, and Nigeria (as well as the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa).
Countries like China and Brazil, which have been successful in reducing malaria rates, could see their hard work undermined by an increase in resistance to antimalarial drugs.
The research we commissioned was based on the limited data available.
It does not take into account the damage from drug-resistant illnesses outside of hospitals or the impact of escalating healthcare costs.
Nor does it include the drop in living standards from the loss of life-enhancing treatments – for example, knee or hip replacements, cancer treatment, and caesarean sections – that rely on antibiotics to prevent infections.
The broad-brush research we conducted shows that such treatments – many of which would not be possible without effective antibiotics – add around 4% of benefit in terms of GDP.
One of my goals is to persuade policymakers at the United Nations to agree to a set of rules and policies to stop the growth of antimicrobial resistance.
In addition to highlighting the scale of the problem, the review is seeking to find ways to reduce drug resistance and to stimulate the production of new antibiotics to compensate for the loss of those that are now or will become ineffective.
Some solutions to reduce resistance will require cutting-edge technology.
We must encourage policymakers to support the development of the best diagnostics.
Quicker, more accurate diagnoses will curb the current overreliance on antibiotics – a key requirement for combating resistance.
We also must develop tools to identify and halt outbreaks of resistant diseases at an early stage.
Data provided by diagnostic devices could be a potent weapon in containing these outbreaks.
Other solutions are low tech, requiring little more than common sense.
We need to start washing our hands thoroughly and often.
We need to stop demanding antibiotics from our doctors.
And, when antibiotics are called for, we need to finish the prescribed course.
As we try to prevent resistance to existing drugs, we will also need to examine the impact of antibiotics in agriculture.
Developing new antibiotics is a challenge, because pharmaceutical companies seem to need incentives to conduct the required research.
The review will study whether market incentives can be changed.
If they cannot, more dramatic alternatives to boost early innovation by university labs and small companies could be sought, perhaps through a targeted fund.
As the review research shows, the stakes of inaction on antimicrobial resistance are high.
Now is the time to search for bold, clear, and practical long-term solutions.
The Global Economy’s Uncertain Future
LONDON – At the start of 2018, most of the world economy was experiencing a synchronized cyclical recovery that seemed to herald a longer period of sustainable growth and an end to the decade-long hangover from the 2008 slump.
Despite the shock of Brexit, storm clouds over the Middle East and Korean Peninsula, and US President Donald Trump’s unpredictable behavior, rising investment and wages, alongside falling rates of unemployment, appeared to be in the offing.
Yet, as I warned in January, “the global mood [had] shifted from fear about political risks to obliviousness, even though many such risks still loom large.”
Moreover, while my preferred global indicators were all looking up, I worried about whether that would continue after the first half of 2018, given foreseeable complications such as monetary-policy tightening across advanced economies, especially in the US.
Lo and behold, we are now halfway through 2018, and some of those same indicators are no longer looking quite so rosy.
While the US Institute for Supply Management’s June Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) remains very strong, other comparable surveys around the world are not nearly as robust as they were six months ago.
Most important, business activity has slowed in both China and Europe.
Another key indicator is South Korea’s trade data, which is published monthly and before that of any other country.
On July 1, we learned that South Korean exports had fallen year-on-year in June 2018.
Whereas 2017 was a record-setting year for the country’s nominal export strength, 2018 has ushered in several months of decelerating performance.
Ironically, this slump coincides with improved relations with North Korea, while the strong performance last year occurred in spite of nuclear brinkmanship on the Korean Peninsula.
The weakening of South Korean exports calls for careful follow-up analysis, both of other major economies’ trade data and of South Korea’s July data, when it is published on August 1.
Given the worrying escalation of Trump’s import tariffs and the retaliatory measures being pursued by China, the European Union, and others, one should not be surprised if the weakening of global trade persists.
That said, one also should not assume that falling trade numbers are a direct result of tariffs.
We do not yet have a full regional breakdown of export performance.
But from the data that are available for the first 20 days of June, we can see that South Korean exports to the US and China were actually rather strong; the weakness was in exports to Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries and the Middle East.
If this remains the case, there is less reason to worry that the strong global-trade performance over the past 12-18 months is being thrown into reverse.
After all, we are in a decade in which the world economy is dominated by activity in the US and China.
According to my calculations, 85% of the growth of nominal GDP worldwide since 2010 is due to these two countries, with the US accounting for 35% and China accounting for 50%.
So, as long as China and the US are doing fine, the global economy can be expected to sustain annual output growth of around 3.4%.
As for the rest of the world, economic indicators from this time last year through early 2018 seemed to suggest that many previously weak performers were finally on the mend.
In nominal dollar terms, Brazil, the EU, Japan, and Russia all experienced slight declines since 2010, but showed signs of improvement in 2017.
For example, at this time last year, the EU looked as though it was on the cusp of a robust, widespread cyclical recovery.
But that no longer seems to be the case.
Key economies such as France and Germany have experienced a slowdown, perhaps owing to fears of a global trade war.
And, of course, the plodding Brexit negotiations, Italy’s new anti-establishment government, and an intra-EU political crisis over immigration have all created more economic uncertainty.
The immigration crisis, in particular, could have severe consequences both for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government and for EU cohesion.
To be sure, Europe’s economic softening could prove temporary, and PMIs for eurozone countries did strengthen somewhat in June, following a couple of months of marked decline.
But it would be foolhardy to rule out the worst.
Still, as we have seen, the sustainability of global growth depends largely on the US and China.
Obviously, if these two economic giants are going to start trading blows with tit-for-tat tariffs, both will lose – and so will the world economy.
For the US, where consumption accounts for around 70% of GDP, positive international trade and a stable, friendly investment climate are essential for sustainable growth.
One hopes that someone close to Trump can turn him around before his policies derail the world’s long-awaited recovery.
The Global Recovery’s Downside Risks
NEW YORK – For the past two years, the global economy has been growing, but it has swung between periods of rapid expansion and deceleration.
During this period, two episodes, in particular, caused US and global equity prices to fall by about 10%.
Is a pattern emerging, or is a fitful global recovery set to stabilize?
The first episode came in August/September 2015, when many observers feared that China’s economy could be headed for a hard landing.
The second episode, in January/February 2016, also stemmed from concerns about China.
But investors were also increasingly worried about stalling US growth, collapsing oil and commodity prices, rapid interest-rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, and unconventional negative-rate monetary policies in Europe and Japan.
Each deceleration episode lasted for about two months, at which point the correction in equity prices began to reverse.
Investors’ fears were not borne out, and central banks began to ease their monetary policies; or, in the case of the Fed, put rate hikes on hold.
As a third example, one could cite the period following the United Kingdom’s Brexit referendum in June 2016.
But that episode was more short-lived, and it did not cause a global slowdown, owing to the small size of the UK economy and monetary easing at the time.
In fact, in the months before US President Donald Trump’s election last November, the global economy actually entered a new period of expansion – albeit one in which advanced and emerging-market economies’ potential growth remained low.
We may still be living in what the International Monetary Fund calls the “new mediocre” – or what the Chinese call the “new normal” – of low potential growth.
And yet economic activity has started to pick up in the US, Europe and the eurozone, Japan, and key emerging markets.
Owing to new stimulus measures, China’s growth rate has stabilized.
And emerging markets such as India, other Asian countries, and even Russia and Brazil – which experienced recessions between 2014 and 2016 – are all doing better.
So, even before the US presidential election had inspired “Trump trades,” a “reflation trade” had signaled a new phase of modest global expansion.
Recent economic data from around the world suggest that growth could now accelerate.
And yet one cannot rule out the possibility that the current expansion will turn into another global slowdown – if not an outright stall – if some downside risks materialize.
For example, markets have clearly been too bullish on Trump.
The US president will not be able to pass any of the radical growth policies he has proposed; and any policy changes that he does make will have a limited impact.
Contrary to what the administration’s budget projections claim, annual economic growth in the US has almost no chance of accelerating from 2% to 3%.
At the same time, markets have underestimated the risks of Trump’s policy proposals.
For example, the administration could still pursue protectionist measures that would precipitate a trade war, and it has already imposed migration restrictions that will likely reduce growth, by eroding the labor supply.
Moreover, Trump might continue to engage in corporatist micromanagement, which would disrupt the private sector’s investment, employment, production, and pricing decisions.
And his fiscal-policy proposals would provide excessive stimulus to an economy that is already close to full employment.
This would force the Fed to raise interest rates even faster, which would derail the US’s recovery, by increasing long-term borrowing costs and strengthening the dollar.
Indeed, Trump has introduced such profound fiscal uncertainty that the Fed could make a mistake in its own policymaking.
If it does not increase rates fast enough, inflation might balloon out of control.
The Fed would then have to hike rates rapidly to catch up at the risk of triggering a recession.
A related risk is that increasing rates too slowly could lead to an asset-price bubble and all the dangers – frozen credit markets, soaring unemployment, plummeting consumption, and more – implied by its inevitable deflation.
The current Fed chair, Janet Yellen, is unlikely to make a mistake.
But over the course of the next year, Trump will have the option of appointing five, and possibly six, new members to the Fed’s seven-member Board of Governors.
If he chooses poorly, the risk of serious policy errors will increase substantially.
Markets are also underestimating today’s geopolitical risks, many of which stem from Trump’s confused and risky foreign policies.
Indeed, the global economy could be destabilized by any number of scenarios involving the US.
A military confrontation between the US and North Korea now seems plausible.
So, too, does a diplomatic or military conflict between the US and Iran that results in an oil-supply shock; or a trade war between the US and China that escalates into a larger geopolitical conflict.
But Trump is not the only global risk.
China has resorted to a fresh round of credit-fueled fixed investment to stabilize its growth rate.
That means that it will have to deal with more toxic assets, debt, leverage, and overcapacity in the medium term.
And because growth and economic stability will top the agenda at the Chinese Communist Party’s National Congress later this year, discussions about how to rebalance growth and implement structural reforms will take a back seat.
But if China does not jumpstart structural reforms and contain its debt explosion by next year, the risk of a hard landing will return.
Elsewhere, the recent Dutch and French election results (and favorable expectations for the German election this September) have reduced the risk that populists will come to power in Europe.
But the EU and eurozone are still in an economic slough.
And market fears of a disintegrating eurozone will return if the anti-euro Five Star Movement comes to power in Italy’s next election, which could be held early this fall.
In the next year, a more robust and persistent global recovery will depend largely on whether policymakers avoid mistakes that could derail it.
At least we know where those mistakes are most likely to be made.
The Global Economy’s Fundamental Weakness
GENEVA – When Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy ten years ago, it suddenly became unclear who owed what to whom, who couldn’t pay their debts, and who would go down next.
The result was that interbank credit markets froze, Wall Street panicked, and businesses went under, not just in the United States but around the world.
With politicians struggling to respond to the crisis, economic pundits were left wondering whether the “Great Moderation” of low business-cycle volatility since the 1980s was turning into another Great Depression.
In hindsight, the complacency in the run-up to the crisis was clearly unconscionable.
And yet little has changed in its aftermath.
To be sure, we are told that the financial system is simpler, safer, and fairer.
But the banks that benefited from public money are now bigger than ever; opaque financial instruments are once again de rigueur; and bankers’ bonus pools are overflowing.
At the same time, un- or under-regulated “shadow banking” has grown into a $160 trillion business.
That is twice the size of the global economy.
Thanks to the trillions of dollars of liquidity that major central banks have pumped in to the global economy over the past decade, asset markets have rebounded, company mergers have gone into overdrive, and stock buybacks have become a benchmark of managerial acumen.
By contrast, the real economy has spluttered along through ephemeral bouts of optimism and intermittent talk of downside risks.
And while policymakers tell themselves that high stock prices and exports will boost average incomes, the fact is that most of the gains have already been captured by those at the very top of the pyramid.
These trends point to an even larger danger: a loss of trust in the system.
Adam Smith recognized long ago that perceptions of rigging will eventually undermine the legitimacy of any rules-based system.
The sense that those who caused the crisis not only got away with it, but also profited from it has been a growing source of discontent since 2008, weakening public trust in the political institutions that bind citizens, communities, and countries together.
During the synchronized global upswing last year, many in the economic establishment spoke too soon when they began to forecast sunnier times.
With the exception of the US, recent growth estimates have fallen short of previous projections, and some economies have even slowed.
While China and India remain on track, the number of emerging economies under financial stress has increased.
As the major central banks talk up monetary-policy normalization, the threats of capital flight and currency depreciation are keeping these countries’ policymakers up at night.
The main problem is not just that growth is tepid, but that it is driven largely by debt.
By early 2018, the volume of global debt had risen to nearly $250 trillion – three times higher than annual global output – from $142 trillion a decade earlier.
Emerging markets’ share of the global debt stock rose from 7% in 2007 to 26% in 2017, and credit to non-financial corporations in these countries increased from 56% of GDP in 2008 to 105% in 2017.
Moreover, the negative consequences of tightening monetary conditions in developed countries will likely become more severe, given the disconnect between asset bubbles and recoveries in the real economy.
While stock markets are booming, wages have remained stuck.
And despite the post-crisis debt expansion, the ratio of investment-to-GDP has been falling in the advanced economies and plateauing in most developing countries.
There is a very big “known unknown” hanging over this fragile state of affairs.
US President Donald Trump’s trade war will neither reduce America’s trade deficit nor turn back the technological clock on China.
What it will do is fuel global uncertainty if tit-for-tat responses escalate.
Even worse, this is occurring just when confidence in the global economy is beginning to falter.
For those countries that are already threatened by heightened financial instability, the collateral damage from a disruption to the global trading system would be significant and unavoidable.
Yet, contrary to conventional wisdom, this is not the beginning of the end of the postwar liberal order.
After all, the unraveling of that order started long ago, with the rise of footloose capital, the abandonment of full employment as a policy goal, the delinking of wages from productivity, and the intertwining of corporate and political power.
In this context, trade wars are best understood as a symptom of unhealthy hyper-globalization.
By the same token, emerging economies are not the problem.
China’s determination to assert its right to economic development has been greeted with a sense of disquiet, if not outright hostility, in many Western capitals.
But China has drawn from the same standard playbook that developed countries used when they climbed the economic ladder.
In fact, China’s success is exactly what was envisioned at the 1947 United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment in Havana, where the international community laid the groundwork for what would become the global trading system.
The difference in discourse between then and now attests to how far the current multilateral order has moved from its original aims.
At first, the Lehman crisis did trigger a revival of the post-war multilateral spirit; but it proved fleeting.
The tragedy of our times is that just when bolder cooperation is needed to address the inequities of hyper-globalization, the drums of “free trade” have drowned out the voices of those calling for a restoration of trust, fairness, and justice in the system.
Without trust, there can be no cooperation.
Are the Good Times Over?
STANFORD – In the 25 years before the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the United States experienced two brief, mild recessions and two strong, long expansions.
Globally, incomes grew briskly; inflation abated; and stock markets boomed.
Moreover, the recovery from the last major slump, in the early 1980s, brought about a quarter-century of unprecedentedly strong and stable macroeconomic performance.
This time, however, the return to growth has been much more difficult.
America’s recovery since the Great Recession, has been inconsistent, with growth repeatedly picking up and then sputtering out.
In fact, the US has not experienced three consecutive quarters of 3% growth in a decade.
Though lower oil prices are helping consumers, this gain is partly offset by less energy investment, and the effects of the stronger dollar will be even larger.
The US is not alone. Though most European economies are now growing again, aided by lower oil prices and currency depreciation, the pace of expansion remains anemic.
Similarly, Japan’s recovery remains fragile, despite strong efforts by the government. Even the major emerging economies, which were supposed to serve as global growth engines in the years ahead, are struggling: China and India have downshifted, and Brazil and Russia are contracting.
When a boom or bust lasts for such a long time, it begins to seem like it will continue indefinitely.
Six years after the crisis, some prominent economists are asking whether insufficient investment and/or waning gains from technological innovation have pushed the global economy into a “new normal” of lower growth and slow, if any, gains in living standards.
Some economists call this “secular stagnation” – a fancy way of saying that the good times are gone for good.
Are they right?
Total economic growth amounts to roughly the sum of the growth of work hours (an increase in the number of workers or the amount of hours that they work) and productivity (output per hour of work).
If productivity improves by one percentage point in a year, the improvement of living standards over the subsequent generation would be augmented by one-third.
Over time, a productivity improvement of even a fraction of a percentage point would be immensely consequential.
Productivity can be enhanced by capital investment, technological innovation, and improvements in the knowledge and skills of the labor force, though economists disagree on which has the largest impact.
According to my research with Larry Lau, technology has played the largest role boosting productivity in the G-7 economies since World War II.
Given this, America’s declining productivity growth – which has averaged just 0.7% annually since 2010 – has led some observers to blame the slowdown on inadequate technological advances.
These pessimists, such as the economist Robert Gordon, claim that new innovations are unlikely to improve productivity as fundamentally as electricity, automobiles, and computers did in the last century.
Optimists counter that smart phones, Big Data, and expected advances in nanotechnology, robotics, and biosciences are harbingers of a new era of technology-driven productivity improvements.
It may be impossible to predict the next “killer app,” they argue, but it will always be developed.
Both sides cite Moore’s Law, named for Intel’s co-founder, Gordon Moore, who noticed that the density of transistors on a chip could be doubled every 18 months.
The pessimists claim that this is becoming harder and more expensive; the optimists hold that the law will remain valid, with chips moving to three dimensions.
Clearly, the trajectory of technological progress is difficult to predict.
In fact, the main commercial value of new technology is not always apparent even to the inventor.
When Guglielmo Marconi made the first transatlantic wireless transmission over a century ago, he was competing with the telegraph in point-to-point communication; he never envisioned popular mass-broadcast radio.
Thomas Edison designed the phonograph to help the blind – and filed a lawsuit to prevent it from being used to play music.
Complicating matters further is the fact that the next wave of productivity-enhancing technological developments are likely to occur in sectors such as health care, where their economic impact is difficult to measure.
Economists believe that many improvements in health-care quality – such as more effective treatments for cataracts or cardiac disease – are not accurately reflected in real GDP, and are incorrectly reported as price increases.
Better measures for these changes are essential for an accurate assessment of economic progress.
To be sure, technology-driven growth carries some risks.
While old fears that automation and artificial intelligence would cause widespread structural unemployment have never been borne out, technology and globalization have put downward pressure on wages for all but the most skilled workers in the advanced economies.
Capital’s share of national income has increased, while labor’s share has fallen.
But implementing policies that restrict potentially productivity-enhancing technologies would be a grave mistake.
To encourage more robust growth and the associated improvements in living standards, governments should ensure that the private sector has sufficient incentives for innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment in physical and human capital.
For example, officials could cut red tape, rein in deficits and debt, enact tax policies conducive to capital formation, reform the education system, and invest in research and development.
Of course, no one should expect a return to the pre-crisis boom years, given the demographic pressures that almost all major economies – including China – are facing.
But these incentives stand the best chance of continuing the flow of productivity-enhancing technology, from startups to the research divisions of established companies in industries from technology to energy to health care.
Good Times at Last?
LONDON – In February 2017, I wrote an optimistic commentary called “The Global Economy’s Surprising Resilience.”
The piece came as a surprise to those who saw only bleak prospects for Western countries, not least the United States, where US President Donald Trump had just been inaugurated.
Now, nearly a year later, my three decades of experience in global financial markets leads me to believe that the economic situation is not quite as straightforward.
On the positive side, the half-dozen cyclical indicators I listed last February remain strong, and some have even strengthened further.
One key indicator is South Korea’s monthly trade data.
The country’s exports grew by 15.8% in 2017, the largest increase since 1956, when it began reporting these data.
Moreover, export growth occurred even as Trump threatened to withdraw from the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement and stoked tensions with North Korea – a powerful rebuke to those who have predicted retrenchment of global trade.
As I suspected a year ago, the slowdown in global trade in past years probably stemmed from the euro crisis and falling commodity prices, and would thus prove temporary.
Now that those two events are behind us, global trade appears to have picked up.
Of course, much will depend on whether trade momentum can be maintained.
Although South Korea’s export performance in December was impressive, it fell slightly short of forecasters’ expectations.
We will have to wait and see if it remains strong in 2018.
Another key cyclical indicator is reflected in monthly Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) surveys for manufacturing and services, which include underlying sub-indices for inventories and sales.
Here, the news is remarkable: PMI survey results in many countries around the world are the strongest they have been in years.
That includes the US, where I have found the Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing index to be consistently accurate and indicative of underlying realities.
It also includes the eurozone, where PMI-survey data have reached their highest levels since before 2000.
Even the United Kingdom’s monthly PMI surveys are showing momentum, though not as much as in other Western countries, most likely owing to the Brexit effect.
If the global economic environment continues to improve, the UK might luck out in its timing for withdrawing from the European Union, notwithstanding the growth-weakening effects that Brexit will surely have.
Crucially, key indicators for China are looking good, too, particularly in terms of long-term growth in services and domestic consumption.
I continue to believe that these two factors will prove immensely consequential not just for China, but for the rest of the world as well.
Many countries want to export more than just commodities and manufacturing inputs to China, and companies around the world are jockeying for access to China’s massive domestic market.
All told, forecasts projecting global GDP growth of 4% or more for 2018 seem credible.
I would not be surprised to see sell-side forecasters lifting their numbers even further in the next two months.
The International Monetary Fund almost certainly will at its annual spring meeting, if not sooner.
So, what’s not to like in the global economic picture for 2018?
For starters, as a veteran of financial markets, I am usually wary of a strong consensus.
While many oft-cited concerns in 2017 turned out to be unwarranted, that doesn’t mean economic risks have disappeared.
In contrast to a year ago, people are increasingly acknowledging that the global economy is stronger than they had thought.
But if growth continues to accelerate, the US Federal Reserve might end up hiking interest rates more than markets anticipated.
And the other major central banks, particularly the People’s Bank of China, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan, might reverse their exceptionally loose monetary policies.
To be sure, if the global economy is truly returning to relatively high and stable growth, monetary-policy tightening need not be harmful – and may even be less harmful than waiting for stronger evidence of inflation to emerge.
Nevertheless, the world’s major economies have enjoyed remarkably generous monetary policies for a decade – and for far longer in Japan’s case.
At the end of the day, no one really knows what the consequences of higher interest rates will be.
For my part, I suspect that productivity growth will accelerate in a number of places, which would justify monetary-policy adjustments and make rising interest rates more tolerable.
But that is just a hunch, based on my reading of tentative wage and productivity data in the UK and the US, among other places.
One final concern is that, while not having gone full circle, the global mood has shifted from fear about political risks to obliviousness, even though many such risks still loom large.
The potential fallout from poor US leadership in the Middle East and on the Korean Peninsula cannot be ignored; nor can the long-term challenges still confronting Europe.
I have long believed that, at least for financial investors, it is better for everyone to be worried about everything than for a small minority to be worried on everyone else’s behalf.
Still, and more important, as long as financial conditions don’t tighten excessively as a result of today’s cyclical strengthening, global economic performance for the rest of this decade could end up being more robust than anyone would have imagined just a few years ago.
In Search of Growth Strategies
MILAN – In 2008, the Commission on Growth and Development, which I had the privilege of chairing, produced a report updating our knowledge about sustainable growth patterns.
Then, as now, one thing is clear: the policies that underpin multi-decade periods of high growth, structural transformation, rising employment and incomes, and dramatic reductions in poverty are mutually reinforcing.
The impact of each is amplified by the others.
They are ingredients in recipes that work – and, as with recipes, missing items can substantially undermine the outcome.
To understand the weak, deteriorating, and fragile growth patterns seen today in many countries and in the global economy as a whole, one should compare what is actually happening with what reasonably comprehensive growth strategies might look like.
Of course, there are many policies that sustain high growth, and to some extent they are country-specific.
But a few key ingredients are common to all known successful cases.
The first is high levels of public and private investment.
In successful developing countries, investment is at or above 30% of GDP.
The public-sector component (infrastructure, human capital, and the economy’s knowledge and technology base) is in the 5-7% range.
And the public- and private-sector investments are complementary: The former raises the rate of return to the latter, and hence its level.
Private domestic and foreign investment is influenced by a host of other factors that affect risks and returns. These include the skills of the workforce, the security of property rights and related legal institutions, ease of doing business (for example, the process and time required for starting a business), and the absence of rigidities in its product and factor markets (those for labor, capital, and raw materials).
Above all, the investment climate is positively influenced by stability – both competent and alert macroeconomic management and political effectiveness and continuity.
Conversely, uncertainty about growth, or the commitment to a reasonably coherent reform agenda, will produce adverse impacts on investment.
A second common ingredient of sustainable growth strategies is that financing these relatively high levels of investment comes from domestic savings.
Substantial reliance on external savings (as reflected in persistent high current-account deficits) seems to end badly – in debt crises and major growth setbacks.
Openness to the global economy with respect to trade and investment is critical as well.
Foreign direct investment, for example, is a key channel for transmitting and adapting the accumulated stock of global technology and knowhow.
And export competitiveness is raised as investment pours into the construction of links in global supply chains.
The capital account is a more complicated story.
Generally, successful developing economies have managed it to prevent excessive volatility, including volatility resulting from external shocks or imbalances and from excessive reliance on external financing.
In addition, most successful countries manage the exchange rate to keep it in line with productivity growth, using a combination of capital controls, monetary policy, and reserve accumulation or decumulation.
Both over- and undervalued currencies have different adverse effects, though persistent overvaluation is more problematic for stability and growth.
Finally, inclusiveness is also a key component of successful development strategies.
Growth patterns that systematically exclude subgroups founder on the loss of political and social cohesion and, ultimately, on the loss of support for the strategy.
By contrast, income inequality that is not too extreme, and that does not arise from corruption or privileged access to markets, is understood and accepted.
The provision of high-quality basic services like education and health care is viewed as crucial for equality of opportunity and intergenerational mobility.
Against that backdrop, one can assess current growth patterns in the global economy and its various parts.
For starters, public-sector investment is broadly below levels needed to restore and sustain growth, partly owing to fiscal constraints in overly indebted countries.
Absent defaults, the normal way to reduce sovereign-debt overhangs is with nominal growth.
But growth-oriented policies have been absent, beyond whatever monetary policy can contribute, and inflation is broadly below targets.
And large pools of savings in sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and insurance companies have not yet been successfully deployed at scale on the public-sector side, presumably because of blockages in the intermediation channels related to risk and incentives.
Private-sector investment (in tangible and intangible assets) is also below growth-sustaining levels (though there are contrary trends in some high-growth technology sectors).
Contributing factors include a shortage of aggregate demand, high levels of uncertainty about policies and regulatory agendas, and growing doubts about key drivers of global growth like China.
In addition, depending on the economy in question, stalled tax reform and policy-induced structural rigidities in product and factor markets are having adverse effects.
With respect to inclusiveness, much useful recent analysis focuses on technology-driven shifts in economic structure and labor markets on the demand side, and globalization, which has left education and skills mismatches on the slower-moving supply side.
Job polarization and rising patterns of income inequality are in part the result of these forces, with adverse effects on final demand and, more important, on the resources that individuals and families have to invest in their own human capital.
In short, a reasonably comprehensive strategy for restoring country-level and global growth would include measures to elevate and remove obstacles to public and private investment, thereby contributing to aggregate demand.
It would also include a variety of reforms to strengthen private investment incentives. And it would include an inclusiveness agenda directed at structural disequilibrium in labor markets and potentially destructive income inequality.
Thus far, with few exceptions, such comprehensive growth strategies have been missing.
If those strategies were not just implemented, but also synchronized across major economies, each would be amplified through positive international spillovers via trade – a clear role for the G-20.
In the absence of such an approach, one can foresee an extended period of low and fragile growth, at best, with downside risks stemming from increased leverage in a prolonged low-interest-rate and deflationary environment.
A worse outcome – and all too plausible – is further deterioration in the political and social cohesion that forms the foundation for vigorous policy responses.
At that point, stagnation becomes a trap.
In Praise of Global Imbalances
SINGAPORE – In recent weeks, there has been a chorus of opinion arguing for a sharp increase in global investment, particularly in infrastructure.
Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers asserted that public investment really is a free lunch, while IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde has argued that an investment boost is needed if the world economy is to “overcome a new mediocre.”
These comments suggest that the world has been under-investing for many years.
In fact, according to International Monetary Fund data, the current overall global investment rate, at 24.5% of world GDP, is near the top of its long-term range.
The issue is not a lack of overall investment, but the fact that a disproportionate share of it comes from China.
China’s share of world investment has soared from 4.3% in 1995 to an estimated 25.8% this year.
By contrast, the United States’ share, which peaked at 36% in 1985, has fallen to less than 18%.
The decline in Japan’s share has been more dramatic, from a peak of 22% in 1993 to just 5.7% in 2013.
China dominates global investment because it saves and invests nearly half of its $10.5 trillion economy.
But this investment rate is likely to decline sharply over the next 5-10 years, because the country already boasts new infrastructure, has excess manufacturing capacity in many sectors, and is trying to shift economic activity to services – which require less investment.
Moreover, China’s rapidly aging population and declining working-age population will reduce long-term investment demand.
Because the current-account balance is the difference between the investment and savings rates, the decline in investment will generate large surpluses unless savings also decline.
And the experience of other aging societies, such as Germany and Japan, suggests that domestic investment falls faster than savings rates.
Thus, China can expect large external surpluses to transform the country from the world’s workshop into its main financier.
Indeed, the scale of capital outflows could be so large that long-term capital will remain cheap even after the world’s major central banks tighten monetary policy. How the world absorbs those surpluses will define the next period of global economic expansion.
Emerging markets may be able to take some advantage of this low-cost financing.
India would undoubtedly benefit, though it is unlikely to absorb a significant portion of China’s excess savings.
India’s share of world investment is only 3.4%; and even a large expansion will not compensate for a small decline in Chinese investment.
Furthermore, East Asia’s growth model has been sustained ultimately by mobilizing rising domestic savings and pumping out exports.
So, although India might initially absorb some international capital, it might ultimately prefer to build foreign reserves by running small external deficits or even a surplus.
Other emerging countries are also unlikely to absorb much of China’s capital.
Notwithstanding its advocacy of public investment spending, even the IMF accepts that a sudden increase in public investment is more likely to cause developing-country indebtedness than growth.
That is why calls by the IMF and others to scale up public infrastructure spending are really aimed at developed countries.
Yet this, too, may prove insufficient.
Germany’s investment-savings gap is so large that, even if it increases domestic investment, the most we can expect from Europe is that it does not add to the global savings glut.
Only a revival in US infrastructure investment can create a sustained global economic recovery.
The US has the necessary scale to absorb China’s surplus, and its inadequate infrastructure provides plenty of avenues for fruitful investment.
Ironically, the IMF’s new investment mantra ultimately leads back to large global imbalances.
But, far from decrying this as a major failure of global policy coordination, economists should accept imbalances as the natural state of the world and try to manage the resulting distortions.
Indeed, almost every period of globalization and prosperity has been accompanied by symbiotic imbalances.
They have always caused economic distortions and political complaints, but many have endured for surprisingly long periods.
Consider, for example, the Indo-Roman trade that drove the world economy in the first and second centuries AD.
India ran a current-account surplus while the Romans complained about the loss of gold, yet the system endured.
Similarly, the first Bretton Woods system was sustained with European capital, and Bretton Woods 2 was fueled by Asian capital, with the US providing the deficits in both cases.
There is no reason why Bretton Woods 3 should not experience similar imbalances.
But if, for whatever reason, the global economy fails to take off, we will have to reconcile ourselves to a long period of mediocre growth in which cheap capital depresses yields, drives up asset prices, inflates bubbles, and seeks out trophy assets.
These are not the sort of imbalances to which the world’s policymakers should aspire.
An Unstable Economic Order?
LAGUNA BEACH – The retreat of the advanced economies from the global economy – and, in the case of the United Kingdom, from regional trading arrangements – has received a lot of attention lately.
At a time when the global economy’s underlying structures are under strain, this could have far-reaching consequences.
Whether by choice or necessity, the vast majority of the world’s economies are part of a multilateral system that gives their counterparts in the advanced world – especially the United States and Europe – enormous privileges.
Three stand out.
First, because they issue the world’s main reserve currencies, the advanced economies get to exchange bits of paper that they printed for goods and services produced by others.
Second, for most global investors, these economies’ bonds are a quasi-automatic component of portfolio allocations, so their governments’ budget deficits are financed in part by other countries’ savings.
The advanced economies’ final key advantage is voting power and representation.
They command either veto power or a blocking minority in the Bretton Woods institutions (the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank), which gives them a disproportionate influence on the rules and practices that govern the international economic and monetary system.
And, given their historical dominance of these organizations, their nationals are de facto assured the top positions.
These privileges don’t come for free – at least they shouldn’t.
In exchange, the advanced economies are supposed to fulfill certain responsibilities that help ensure the system’s functioning and stability.
But recent developments have cast doubts on whether the advanced economies are able to hold up their end of this bargain.
Perhaps the most obvious example is the 2008 global financial crisis.
The result of excessive risk-taking and lax regulation in the advanced economies, the financial system’s near-meltdown disrupted global trade, threw millions into unemployment, and almost tipped the world into a multi-year depression.
But there have been other lapses, too.
For example, political obstacles to comprehensive economic policymaking in many advanced economies have undermined the implementation of structural reforms and responsive fiscal policies in recent years, holding back business investment, undermining productivity growth, worsening inequality, and threatening future potential growth.
Such economic lapses have contributed to the emergence of anti-establishment political movements that are looking to change – or are already changing – long-established cross-border trade relations, including those within the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Meanwhile, a prolonged and excessive reliance on monetary policy, including direct central-bank involvement in market activities, has distorted asset prices and contributed to resource misallocation.
And the advanced economies – particularly Europe – have shown little appetite for reforming outdated elements of governance and representation at the international financial institutions, despite major changes in the global economy.
The result of all this is a multilateral system that is less effective, less collaborative, less trusted, and more vulnerable to ad hoc tinkering.
Against this background, it should not be surprising that globalization and regionalization no longer command the degree of support they once did – or that some rising political movements on both sides of the Atlantic are condemning both concepts to win more support for their own causes.
It is not yet clear whether this is a temporary and reversible phenomenon or the beginning of a protracted challenge to the functioning of the global economy.
What is clear is that it is affecting two important relationships.
The first is the relationship between small and large economies.
For a long time, small, well-managed, and open economies were the leading beneficiaries of the Bretton Woods system and, more generally, of multilateralism.
Their size not only made them crave access to outside markets; it also made other market actors more willing to integrate them into regional pacts, owing to their limited displacement potential.
Membership in effective international institutions brought these countries into consequential global policy discussions, while their own capabilities allowed them to exploit opportunities in cross-border production and consumption chains.
But, at a time of surging nationalism, these small and open economies, however well managed, are likely to suffer.
Their trading relationships are less stable; the trade pacts on which they depend are vulnerable; and their participation in global policy discussions is less assured.
The second relationship is that between the Bretton Woods institutions and parallel institutional arrangements.
For example, while they pale in significance to, say, the World Bank, China-led institutions have proved appealing to a growing number of countries; most US allies have joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, despite American opposition.
Similarly, bilateral payment agreements – which, not long ago, most countries would have opposed via the IMF, owing to their inconsistency with multilateralism – are proliferating.
The concern is that these alternative approaches could undermine, rather than reinforce, a predictable and beneficial rules-based system of cross-border interactions.
The Bretton Woods organizations, instituted after World War II to maintain stability, risk losing their influence, and the countries with the clout to bolster them seem unwilling at this stage to press ahead boldly with the needed reforms.
If these tendencies continue, developing countries will probably suffer the most; but they won’t be alone.
In the short term, the world economy would face slower economic growth and the risk of greater financial instability.
In the longer term, it would confront the threat of systemic fragmentation and proliferating trade wars.
Out of Ammunition to Combat Recession?
STANFORD – Economic forecasts for 2017 project continued frailty in the global economy, and subpar growth for most countries and regions.
Obvious economic problems include Europe’s weak banks, China’s distorted property market, political uncertainty in the West, historically high private and public debt – 225% of GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund – and the reluctance of heavily indebted Greece and Portugal to comply with IMF programs.
Additional global economic risks, such as a major oil-market disruption that could drive prices up, are not as obvious, and thus receive less attention.
Economists call such events “shocks” precisely because they come unexpectedly and can have far-reaching consequences.
Unprecedented long-term monetary stimulus and massive spikes in public-debt burdens have left governments poorly equipped to manage the next economic downturn when – not if – it arrives.
The next recession probably will not be as bad as the last one, but advanced economies will be far better prepared for it if they undergo gradual monetary-policy normalization and fiscal consolidation in the meantime.
With respect to monetary policy, the United States’ unemployment rate, at around 5%, is close to what most economists consider full employment, and the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise its target interest rate again in December. But the Fed is moving at a very slow pace.
The European Central Bank will likely extend its bond-purchasing program; but it has reason to question the results of its quantitative-easing policy, given that eurozone unemployment still averages around 10%, indicating a sizeable output gap.
Meanwhile, the Japanese economy continues to limp along, with the Bank of Japan now “managing the yield curve” in yet another attempt to raise inflation and growth from their current low levels.
In terms of fiscal policy, most advanced economies’ public finances are suffering because policymakers have failed to implement sufficient supply-side structural reforms to control public-pension growth, reform growth-inhibiting taxes, and liberalize labor markets.
These fiscal-policy failures have put too much of the burden on central banks, even though growth would more likely accelerate with productivity-enhancing supply-side measures.
Lately, the economists who are most influential with left-leaning politicians seem hopeful that growth, employment, and incomes will rise if policymakers embrace massive new deficit-financed spending to create demand for goods and services.
They argue that with borrowing costs so low, deficit spending is virtually free, and we need not worry about high debt levels.
But this argument ignores the typically large gap between what economists devise and what politicians promise, and what public-spending programs actually deliver.
As ECB President Mario Draghi has put it, “There aren’t many public investments with a high rate of return.”
Governments should certainly cut taxes and fund initiatives that pass rigorous cost-benefit tests; but broad new spending programs usually do not yield a significant or immediate economic boost.
For starters, spending generally occurs well into the future, when economic conditions are projected to be better.
As President Barack Obama, referring to his signature 2009 stimulus bill, eventually admitted, “the shovels weren’t ready.”
Similarly, Japan has attempted government spending stimulus for decades, with little to show for it in terms of overall economic growth.
To be sure, large deficits can be benign or even desirable during recessions and wars, or when used to finance productive public investments; and in a deep, long-lasting downturn, with interest rates at or near zero, a well-timed, sensible fiscal response can theoretically help in the short term.
But studies show that the multiplier effect of government spending – when it may increase GDP by more than the expenditure – shrinks rapidly after a few quarters, and then turns negative.
In fact, the multiplier effect can even be negative during economic expansions when central banks maintain zero-interest rates and households expect taxes to rise when interest rates do.
Because new government purchases can devolve into counterproductive political boondoggles that spur little economic growth, another proposal one often hears is to expand government transfer payments.
Leaving aside the fact that transfer payments are already fiscally unsustainable in most countries (because they were adopted and expanded under better economic and demographic conditions), could they lift the economy?
A recent study addresses this very question.
According to former Obama administration Chief Economist Christina Romer and David Romer of the University of California, Berkeley, even permanent transfer-payment increases provide stimulus for only a few months, and the effect does not spread to employment.
The study concludes that the benefits from transfers are “much less persistent, and much smaller overall, than those of tax changes.”
In economies where stimulus programs are carefully vetted and can be implemented quickly, any temporary government spending should be coupled with gradual fiscal consolidation, to minimize economic risk and long-term costs.
As history and theory indicate, this fiscal consolidation should happen through reduced future spending growth, especially on transfer payments.
Economic policymakers should heed this lesson so that they can gradually re-arm themselves; otherwise, they could be left with no firepower when they most need it.
Two Cheers for the New Normal
JAKARTA – The conventional wisdom about the state of the world economy goes something like this: Since the start of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the developed world has struggled to recover, with only the United States able to adjust.
Emerging countries have fared better, but they, too, have started to flounder lately.
In a bleak economic climate, the argument goes, the only winners have been the wealthy, resulting in skyrocketing inequality.
That scenario sounds entirely right – until, on closer examination, it turns out to be completely wrong.
Start with economic growth.
According to the International Monetary Fund, during the first decade of this century, annual global growth averaged 3.7%, compared to 3.3% in the 1980s and 1990s.
In the last four years, growth has averaged 3.4%.
This is far lower than what many had hoped; in 2010, I predicted that in the coming decade, the world could grow at a 4.1% annual rate.
But 3.4% is hardly disastrous by historical standards.
To be sure, all of the large, developed economies are growing more slowly than they did when their economic engines were roaring.
But it is only the eurozone that has badly disappointed in recent years.
I had assumed, when I made my projections in 2010, that the region’s poor demographics and weak productivity would prevent it from growing at more than 1.5% a year.
Instead, it has managed only a meager 0.3%.
For Japan, the US, and the United Kingdom, the prospects are brighter.
It should be relatively straightforward for them to grow at an average rate that outpaces that of the last decade – a period that includes the peak of the financial crisis.
In addition, the dramatic drop in the price of crude oil will serve as the equivalent of a large tax cut for consumers.
Indeed, I am rather baffled by the IMF’s decision to downgrade its growth forecast for much of the world.
If anything, with oil prices falling, an upward revision seems warranted.
Another factor supporting a more positive outlook is the rebalancing that has occurred between the US and China, the world’s two largest economies.
Each entered the financial crisis with huge current-account imbalances.
The US was running a deficit of more than 6.5% of its GDP, and China had a surplus of close to 10% of its GDP.
Today, the US deficit has fallen to about 2%, and the Chinese surplus is less than 3%.
Given that their intertwined imbalances were key drivers of the financial crisis, this is a welcome development.
It has recently become fashionable to disparage the economic performance of the large emerging countries, particularly China and the other BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, and India).
But it is hardly a surprise that these countries are no longer growing as fast as they once did.
In 2010, I predicted that China’s annual growth would slow to 7.5%.
It has since averaged 8%.
India’s performance has been more discouraging, though growth has picked up since early 2014.
The only real disappointments are Brazil and Russia, both of which have struggled (again, not surprisingly) with much lower commodity prices.
Their lethargic performance, together with the eurozone’s, is the main reason why the world economy has not managed the 4.1% growth that optimists like me thought was feasible.
The conventional wisdom on wealth and inequality is similarly mistaken.
From 2000 to 2014, global GDP more than doubled, from $31.8 trillion to over $75 trillion.
Over the same period, China’s nominal GDP soared from $1.2 trillion to more than $10 trillion – growing at more than four times the global rate.
In 2000, the BRIC economies’ combined size was about a quarter of US GDP.
Today, they have nearly caught up, with a combined GDP of more than $16 trillion, just short of America’s $17.4 trillion.
Indeed, since 2000, the BRICs have been responsible for nearly a third of the rise in nominal global GDP.
And other emerging countries have performed similarly well.
Nigeria’s economy has grown 11-fold since 2000, and Indonesia’s has more than quintupled.
Since 2008, these two developing giants have contributed more to global GDP growth than the EU has.
Statistics like these utterly disprove the idea that global inequality is growing.
Gaps in income and wealth may be shooting up within individual countries, but per capita income in developing countries is rising much faster than in the advanced economies.
Indeed, that is why one of the key targets of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals – to halve the number of people living in absolute poverty – was achieved five years ahead of the deadline.
None of this is meant to deny that we are living in challenging and uncertain times.
But one thing is clear: economically, at least, the world is continuing to become a better place.
The Economic View from the Alps
LONDON – I recently took a trip to Switzerland – a remarkable country that I have been fortunate to visit many times over the past 40 years.
In addition to having a good time, I found a Swiss perspective useful to reflect on the state of the world and its economic vitality.
Aside from its wealth – or perhaps because of it – Switzerland has always struck me as a happy country.
While spending some time in Zurich in 1994, I first experienced the joy of swimming in the city’s river and lake.
And nowadays, it is common to see people doing this in many other urban areas, including Basel, where contented souls enjoy the mighty Rhine.
I recently overheard two Swiss speakers teasing each other about whether the swimming is better in Zurich, Basel, or the capital, Bern, with its fast-flowing white waters.
Where else in the developed world can one enjoy such accessible pleasures?
I used to find it amusing that so many Germans regard Switzerland as their ideal country; as I have grown older, I have come to understand what they mean.
Another reason to admire Switzerland is its astonishing railway system, which crisscrosses every nook and cranny of the country.
On this occasion, we traveled by train to the Bernese Highlands (Berner Oberland), just as I had done nearly 40 years ago.
As we made our precisely timed connections with ease, I wondered why so many other Western governments have deemed the public sector to be incapable of running an efficient railway system. The Swiss system is a testament to how public expenditures and administration can benefit all of a country’s citizens.
As someone who was deeply involved in the British government’s “northern powerhouse” project, I take the Swiss example to heart.
It further bolsters my belief that the United Kingdom should make state-of-the-art railways a priority, especially in the north, to connect Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield, Newcastle, and their surrounding areas.
Of course, in other ways, Swiss and British economic experience is nothing alike.
In recent years, the Swiss franc has appreciated significantly against almost every other currency.
For Britons, there are better ways to pass the time than to calculate the pittance that a pound now buys in Switzerland, and I was not surprised to see so few others on my trip.
I did, however, see plenty of visitors from Asian countries at some of the Alps’ most beautiful sites.
This reminded me of my very first trip to Switzerland, as a student traveling on an Interrail card, when I saw Japanese tourists lined up to board the mountain train at Kleine Scheidegg. They were making the exciting climb up to the Jungfrau and the highest mountain station in Europe, and I seem to remember that they had their own carriage, perhaps to aid with translation.
Back then, Japan was supposedly about to overtake the United States to become the world’s largest economy.
But within a decade, its asset-price bubble had burst, and its economy had essentially flat-lined in nominal terms.
These days, it is China that will supposedly overtake the US; and, as it happens, that same Kleine Scheidegg station platform now has a carriage reserved for Chinese tourists.
And yet there are still plenty of Japanese tourists in Switzerland, too; and in Grindelwald, one of the Bernese Highlands’s many picturesque villages, there is even a Japanese-language information center.
This reveals a less-appreciated side of the Japanese economic story.
Adjusting for Japan’s declining workforce shows that in terms of per capita GDP, Japan has actually performed just as well as many other advanced economies in recent years.
Moreover, recent data indicate that Japan may be embarking on a strong, domestically driven economic expansion.
In the second quarter of this year, its growth rate was among the best in the G7.
Given these trends, I suspect that Switzerland will continue to host plenty of Japanese tourists in the coming years.
And if China, with its population of 1.4 billion people, maintains its economic trajectory of the last 20 years, the Swiss will probably have to build a new, much larger station at Kleine Scheidegg.
Of course, China could also fall short of its aspirations, as its persistently bearish skeptics have predicted.
But while in Switzerland, I couldn’t help but think that the constant talk of China exaggerating its official economic data has become a farce.
To appreciate China’s rise, one need only look at all the Chinese tourists in the Bernese Highlands and many other places.
To be sure, the Chinese economic miracle will end at some point. But that time has not yet come.
On the contrary, my trip provided ample anecdotal evidence in support of the data showing a strong global recovery in 2017.
That recovery is real, and it will most likely continue to broaden and include more countries – at least for now.
Bad Financial Moon Rising
BASEL – No one should overestimate economists’ powers of understanding.
Just as the magnitude of the global downturn that began in mid-2008 took most economists completely by surprise, so did the sclerotic nature of the recovery.
Similarly, economic forecasts today appear to be nothing more than hopeful extrapolations of recent growth.
In reality, all is not well beneath the surface.
Should another financial crisis materialize, the subsequent recession might be even costlier than the last one, not least because policymakers will face unprecedented economic and political constraints in responding to it.
Some take comfort in post-crisis improvements to global financial regulation, on the assumption that these measures will prevent financial distress from spilling over into the real economy.
This is an ill-advised stance.
The analytical foundations of many of these “improvements” appear shaky, and the challenges of implementing the new regulatory regime have proven formidable.
Perhaps most important, ultra-easy monetary policies have encouraged precisely the risky financial behavior that regulations were supposed to limit.
With monetary policy firmly on the accelerator, and regulatory policies firmly on the brake, the likeliest result is heightened instability.
The most worrisome side effect of recent monetary policies has been a continuous increase in the ratio of non-financial debt to global GDP.
Though the 2008 crisis offered an opportunity for deleveraging, the opposite has happened.
Debt has piled up worldwide, with the biggest increases found in emerging-market private sectors.
The recovery in emerging-market economies was supposed to be part of the post-crisis solution.
Now, these economies are part of the problem.
The fact that much of this dollar-denominated debt has been issued by non-US residents means that another costly currency-mismatch crisis could be in store.
In addition to ballooning global debt levels, sky-high property prices seem to be heading for a turn, and “risk-free” long-term rates remain unusually low in many countries.
Very low credit risk and term spreads, along with record-low measures of volatility, have invited still more risky behavior.
Should these spreads normalize, the risks would come home to roost.
The record-high percentage of “covenant-lite” new loans (lacking many basic protections for the lender) further attests to excessive risk-taking.
Of course, it also implies that recovery rates on bad loans (and associated collateralized loan obligations) could be unexpectedly high.
The fact that asset-management companies and private-equity firms have increasingly displaced regulation-constrained banks as lenders has made it increasingly difficult to see what is actually going on, and to anticipate how future financial retrenchment might play out, particularly with respect to emerging markets.
Should financial markets begin to tighten, either spontaneously or in response to tighter monetary conditions, there is good reason to worry about overshooting.
Owing to the major central banks’ unconventional monetary policies over the past decade, the process of “price discovery” in financial markets has long been curtailed.
At this point, even “efficient” financial markets would struggle to adapt to normalization.
And there have been many indications of financial-market inefficiency in recent years, including continuing anomalies such as the violation of covered interest parity conditions in foreign-exchange markets, bouts of reduced liquidity (partly owing to new regulations), and recurrent flash crashes.
And to these “known knowns” we must add the “known unknowns” associated with algorithmic trading and passive investing.
A final major risk to the global economy is US President Donald Trump’s administration, whose protectionist policies are threatening to slow real (inflation-adjusted) growth and drive up inflation.
And while fiscal expansion in the United States might temporarily offset growth impediments, it, too, will exacerbate inflationary pressures and undermine longer-term debt sustainability.
Moreover, both protectionism and fiscal expansion are strengthening the dollar, and thus squeezing US exporters and foreigners who have borrowed in dollars.
Complicating matters further, Trump’s statement that he is not “thrilled” at the prospect of higher interest rates points to the risk of a too-compliant Federal Reserve ending up behind the inflationary curveball.
When that happens, a recession typically follows.
Lastly, the Trump administration is increasingly using the dollar – and access to dollar clearing and funding – as a geopolitical weapon, risking retaliation and perhaps even jeopardizing the future of the dollar-based global monetary system.
All of these risks are raising the likelihood of a mass “hunkering down” in the face of future shocks.
Worse, should the global economy experience another significant downturn, policymakers will find it much harder to respond than they did before.
Initially low policy rates mean that central banks will have very little room for traditional monetary easing.
As for unconventional monetary policies, there is still much disagreement about their effectiveness.
At any rate, new measures would imply further increasing central banks’ balance sheets, which many (not least in Central Europe) already consider to be a potential source of future inflation.
Likewise, regardless of their merits, fiscal policies will almost certainly be constrained by leaders’ fears of rapidly rising sovereign debt, especially in the major advanced economies.
Another bank bailout would of course produce a severe political backlash.
But even if the Fed was willing to risk it, provisions in the 2010 US Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation explicitly limit its discretion in such matters.
Whether those provisions apply to the Fed’s technical capacity to provide dollars to foreign central banks – as it did on a massive scale in late 2008 – remains to be seen.
An even bigger political constraint has emerged in the last decade.
Whereas the 2008 crisis was a global phenomenon that elicited a global response, the growth of nationalist sentiment in many countries would likely impede similar cooperation.
Would the US Congress now allow the Fed to lend trillions of dollars to “freeloading foreigners”?
Add to that the rise of China and India, and the US role in global leadership is less clear-cut than it was a decade ago.
If another economic downturn were to fuel further nationalist gains and faster erosion of international cooperation, we could find ourselves on an old, familiar, and extremely dangerous path.
The West’s Broken Promises on Education Aid
NEW YORK – The Global Partnership for Education, a worthy and capable initiative to promote education in 65 low-income countries, is having what the jargon of development assistance calls a “replenishment round,” meaning that it is asking donor governments to refill its coffers.
Yet the fact that the GPE is begging for mere crumbs – a mere $1 billion per year – exposes the charade of Western governments’ commitment to the global Education for All agenda.
The United States and the European Union have never cared that much about that agenda.
When it comes to disease, they have at times been willing to invest to slow or stop epidemics like AIDS, malaria, and Ebola, both to save lives and to prevent the diseases from coming to their own countries.
But when it comes to education, many countries in the West are more interested in building walls and detention camps than schools.
The GPE does excellent work promoting primary education around the world.
Donor countries, all of which long ago signed on to Education for All, should be clamoring to help one of the world’s most effective organizations to achieve that goal.
Yet generous donors are few and far between.
This reality extends back to imperial times.
When most of Africa and much of Asia were under European rule, the colonizers invested little in basic education.
As late as 1950, according to United Nations data, illiteracy was pervasive in Europe’s African and Asian colonies.
At the time of independence from Britain, India’s illiteracy rate stood at 80-85%, roughly the same as Indonesia’s illiteracy rate at the time of independence from the Netherlands.
In French West Africa, the illiteracy rate in 1950 stood at 95-99%.
After independence, African and Asian countries pursued massive and largely successful initiatives to raise basic education and literacy.
Yet, far from seizing this opportunity to make up for lost time, Europe and the US have provided consistently meager assistance for primary and secondary education, even as they have made high-profile commitments such as Education for All and Sustainable Development Goal 4, which calls for universal access to pre-primary through secondary school.
Consider the grim data on development aid for education, which has stagnated for years – and actually declined between 2010 and 2015.
According to the most recent OECD data, total donor aid for primary and secondary education in Africa amounted to just $1.3 billion in 2016. To put that figure in perspective, the US Pentagon budget is roughly $2 billion per day.
With around 420 million African kids of school age, total aid amounted to roughly $3 per child per year.
It’s not as if Western governments don’t know that far more is needed. Several detailed recent calculations provide credible estimates of how much external financing developing countries will need to achieve SDG 4.
A UNESCO study puts the total at $39.5 billion per year.
A report by the International Commission on Financing Education Opportunity, led by former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, similarly put developing countries’ external financing needs at tens of billions of dollars per year.
Here is the reason why aid is needed.
A year of education in Africa requires at least $300 per student. (Note that the rich countries spend several thousand dollars per student per year.)
With Africa’s school-age population accounting for roughly one-third of the total, the per capita financing requirement is about $100.
Yet for a typical African country, that’s about 10% of per capita national income – far more than the education budget can cover.
External aid can and should cover the financing gap so that all children can attend school.
That’s not happening.
Annual spending per school-aged child in Sub-Saharan Africa is roughly one-third of the minimum needed.
As a result, most kids don’t come anywhere close to finishing secondary school.
They are forced to drop out early, because there are no openings in public schools and tuition for private school is far too high for most families.
Girls are especially likely to leave school early, though parents know that all of their children need and deserve a quality education.
Without the skills that a secondary education provides, the children who leave school early are condemned to poverty.
Many eventually try to migrate to Europe in desperate search of a livelihood.
Some drown on the way; others are caught by European patrols and returned to Africa.
So now comes the GPE’s replenishment round, scheduled for early February in Senegal.
The GPE should be receiving at least $10 billion a year (about four days’ military spending by the NATO countries) to put Africa on a path toward universal secondary education.
Instead, the GPE is reportedly still begging donors for less than $1 billion per year to cover GPE programs all over the world.
Instead of actually solving the education crisis, rich-country leaders go from speech to speech, meeting to meeting, proclaiming their ardent love of education for all.
Across Africa, political, religious, and civil-society leaders are doing what they can.
Ghana has recently announced free upper-secondary education for all, setting the pace for the continent.
As African countries struggle to fund their ambitious commitments, new partners, including private companies and high-net-worth individuals, should step forward to help them.
Traditional donors, for their part, have decades of lost time to make up for.
The quest for education will not be stopped, but history will judge harshly those who turn their backs on children in need.
A Networked Solution to Education Reform
WASHINGTON, DC – Around the world, some 250 million children are unable to attend school, and many who do have access to a classroom are not learning the skills they need to succeed in life.
And, despite a growing consensus about the systemic nature of the challenges affecting education, there is less agreement about how to address those systemic challenges.
Yet 2018 is shaping up to be a promising year for global efforts to improve educational access and quality.
One reason is the emergence of so-called peer action networks, which facilitate knowledge-sharing globally and encourage continuous improvement locally.
Such networks, if organized properly, could offer a partial solution to the systemic challenges affecting education.
There are numerous peer groups tackling some of the planet’s most difficult problems, but two that are associated with our organizations are worth highlighting.
One is the Joint Learning Network for Universal Health Coverage (JLN), a community of practitioners and policymakers from 30 countries supported by Results for Development and other development partners.
The other is the Asia Society’s Global Cities Education Network (GCEN), which facilitates improvements in urban education systems throughout North America and Asia.
Each of these international peer networks has produced local results.
For example, in 2016, Denver Public Schools in Colorado – a GCEN member – created the CareerConnect program, which provides workplace-based learning opportunities for students.
The program draws on lessons from vocational education systems in Hong Kong, Melbourne, and Singapore – all GCEN member cities – as well as Switzerland, to help graduates prepare for life after high school.
Similarly, the JLN has made significant progress helping developing countries move toward universal health coverage.
Network support has enabled members to navigate technical roadblocks and secure political support at home.
Adapting the JLN model to support officials of national education ministries could produce comparable gains in education in many countries.
Both of these networks offer a global platform for local practitioners to devise solutions and drive innovation.
And both are organized around five principles that we believe successful peer groups – in education or any sector – should strive to incorporate into their own work.
First, networks bring together leaders who are facing similar issues in varying contexts.
International peer action networks are most effective when they are cross-cultural; we have found that connecting disparate groups that are working toward similar goals often produces unexpected solutions that are more robust.
Second, the “peer” component of these networks is strongly emphasized.
Members are equally empowered to set priorities and contribute to discussions.
Networked learning is most successful when participants feel a sense of ownership with respect to outcomes.
Third, membership includes those with the authority and the ability to influence change.
For example, many challenges at the national or city level in education planning require both political and technical solutions.
For a network to be effective, policymakers and practitioners must work in concert to find solutions to shared challenges.
Fourth, the JLN and the GCEN are committed to measuring collective and individual progress.
While gauging success in education can be difficult, especially across contexts, peer action networks must be oriented toward achieving results, and that means measuring their effectiveness.
Moreover, accountability metrics should be derived from systems that members are already using at home.
Finally, these networks strive to be sustainable.
To drive large-scale and lasting change through a network in any sector, but especially in global education, requires consistent vision, staffing, and financial resources.
Peer group participants cannot simultaneously work as policymakers or practitioners and collaboratively run a network organization.
Budgeting for central teams to manage the technical support to members and operations of the network is critical to success.
Unfortunately, very little education funding is currently set aside for investments in new learning networks.
Increasing investment in peer action networks could help to bolster leadership and implementation capacity – critical to expand learning opportunities around the world, a key objective of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
There are no easy solutions to providing high-quality education to every child on the planet.
However, as the growth in peer action networks demonstrates, global education leaders are not in this struggle alone.
When like-minded policymakers and practitioners share ideas and collaborate on solutions, the world’s educational challenges become a little less daunting.
Global Energy Realism
MADRID – Energy has become a focal point of global policymaking.
As falling oil prices grab headlines worldwide, US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping have signed a major climate-change deal, and October’s European Council decisions could signal real progress toward a serious European Union energy policy.
This momentum should be maintained in the coming year, culminating in December’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris.
But, in order to establish a global energy system that meets growing demand within the constraints of carbon neutrality, we must avoid the pitfalls that have plagued past responses.
In particular, we must strike the proper balance between ideology and realism, the public and private sectors, and long- and short-term considerations.
And, critically, we must follow through on our commitments.
When it comes to ideology and realism, the European Union is perhaps the best example of an imbalanced approach, as Europeans’ tendency to lead with their hearts, rather than their heads, has undermined effective action.
The knee-jerk rejection of nuclear power by some EU member countries has led to sharp increases in coal usage.
Renewables have been pursued with a sort of missionary zeal, regardless of their effectiveness or feasibility.
And the EU’s “20/20/20 targets” – a 20% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions, a 20% share for renewables, and a 20% increase in energy efficiency, all by 2020 – was more of a mantra than a policy.
Bridging the gap between the public and private sectors is vital to finance the construction of an efficient global energy system.
The International Energy Agency estimates that by 2040, the annual investment required in energy-supply infrastructure alone will total $2 trillion, up 20% from current levels.
Over the next 26 years, some $51 trillion will be needed.
This is just part of the overall infrastructure investment shortfall, which stands at $1 trillion annually – far more than what governments can afford.
That is why governments must build innovative partnerships with private-sector actors, while recognizing that energy, as a public good, must be subject to appropriate regulation and oversight.
There have been some notable moves in this direction, though it remains to be seen whether they will translate into real action.
China has spearheaded the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
More important, the World Bank, the G-20, and the EU recently launched initiatives aimed at directing the financing power of business toward infrastructure development.
The World Bank’s Global Infrastructure Facility is an open platform that brings together multilateral development banks, national governments, and private finance to shepherd infrastructure projects to completion and to fill in gaps that have hampered investment.
Pivotal to sparking this investment is the mitigation of associated political risks, especially through an enhanced role for the Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.
Similarly, at last month’s summit in Brisbane, the G-20 created a new Global Infrastructure Hub to facilitate information-sharing, thereby streamlining infrastructure projects.
And, the EU’s Connecting Europe Facility has allocated €5.85 billion ($7.2 billion) from now until 2020 to help kick-start private investment in infrastructure projects linking member countries’ energy systems.
Of course, the need for private-sector involvement extends beyond investment.
The private sector is also better situated to research and develop new production methods that limit demand for fossil fuels.
To spur such action, the public sector should offer funds or guarantees, which, though risky, could offer huge benefits.
US government funding of research into hydraulic fracturing – the technology now driving the surge in America’s oil and gas production – dates back to the 1970s.
This brings us to the need to balance short-term imperatives with long-term vision.
Energy projects and policies today must account for the projected increase in emerging-market demand, while ensuring sufficient investment in future generating capacity.
For example, over the next 25 years, 60% of the EU’s generating capacity is due to retire – contributing to demand for $2.2 trillion of energy investment.
Furthermore, with US tight-oil production expected to peak in the early 2020s, new sources must be developed, such as in Iraq.
Given the long lead time for bringing new projects onstream, efforts to address the coming shortfall must begin today.
In all of these efforts, there is one common imperative: matching words with deeds.
The world does not need more commitments and pledges; it needs action.
Yet many countries continue to issue weak declarations that fail to produce genuine progress.
Once again, this problem is particularly pervasive in Europe.
The maxims of today – the need for diverse suppliers, enhanced interconnection, greater efficiency, and a sensible energy mix – have been discussed for at least a decade.
In fact, despite the seemingly unending stream of new energy initiatives and projects, Europe has made little progress; its energy situation may even be worse.
Repackaging the same old strategies – here one need look no further than European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker’s much-hyped €300 billion investment package – simply will not work.
With attention focused on COP21 next December, the coming year will be an exceptional opportunity to build a sound global energy system.
Europe, which has prided itself on its energy leadership, should set an example by developing – and then implementing – a realistic long-term strategy that involves the private sector.
Equality for All?
LONDON – Last month, I was invited to speak at the York Festival of Ideas, an annual forum for debating alternative, predominantly progressive policy goals.
I talked about my work on asset-price stabilization.
Andy Wood of the consultancy Grant Thornton spoke about inclusiveness in business, Neil McInroy of the Center for Local and Economic Strategies discussed local organizing, and Ander Etxeberria of the Mondragon Corporation told us about their employee-owned cooperatives in the Basque Country.
But, most importantly, Wanda Wyporska of The Equality Trust gave a fascinating talk about the principle of “equality for all.”
Few on the left or the right nowadays would actively advocate inequality for all.
Rather, the divide is between conservatives who promote equality of opportunity and progressives who promote equality of outcomes.
This is an important distinction.
But whatever your definition of equality, the bigger question is how best to achieve it.
After World War II, the world adopted the Bretton Woods system, whereby countries maintained fixed exchange rates against the dollar, and capital was largely immobile at the international level.
When tourists from the United Kingdom traveled to France, Italy, or Spain, they faced restrictions on how many francs, lire, or pesetas they could buy; and international investment was constrained by a pervasive system of capital controls.
With the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, the world embarked on a bold new adventure in globalization.
The result was a massive reduction in global inequality, as capital flowed to places where wage levels were a tiny fraction of those in Western democracies.
Economic theory predicts that when two countries engage in trade, both will emerge better off.
But it does not tell us that every inhabitant of those two countries will be better off.
On the contrary, it predicts that globalization will generate winners and losers, and decades of experience have borne that out.
The liberalization of international capital markets has been unequivocally good for 800 million unskilled Chinese workers.
It has been unequivocally good for Westerners who derive their income primarily from renting their physical and intellectual capital to the highest bidder.
But for Westerners whose primary source of income is the sale of their unskilled labor to the marketplace, the era of globalization has coincided with decades of wage stagnation.
Though the nation-state is not a perfect institution, it has provided Western social-democratic parties with the tools to improve living conditions for their fellow citizens.
Western democracies did not always provide pensions and health care to their citizens.
Laws governing working conditions, prohibiting child labor, providing free education, and granting universal suffrage to all adult men and women did not emerge from nowhere.
They were the results of reform movements and political conflict – often violent – over the course of 200 years.
The post-Bretton Woods liberalization of capital controls, in the absence of equivalent protections for workers, led to predictable results.
Labor unions that had long protected the rights of workers in Western countries lost their bargaining power, and with it the ability to negotiate for more humane working conditions and higher wages at home.
When opinion-makers in Western democracies promote the free international movement of capital, one could say that they are advancing the cause of global equality by raising the wages of workers in developing countries.
But, of course, Western elites also benefit from higher salaries and increased profits when intellectual and physical capital flows to low-wage countries with weaker labor protections.
When they promote globalization as a universal leveler, they are generally not thinking about the welfare of unskilled Chinese workers so much as their own self-interest.
If Westerners benefit from less expensive Chinese-made cell phones and consumer electronics and South Korean-made automobiles, then so much the better.
But while globalization has narrowed the gap between rich and poor countries, the gap between the rich and the poor within Western democracies has widened, owing to stagnant growth in median income.
Economists disagree about the causes of this divergence.
Part of it is likely due to new technologies that increasingly replace workers who carry out repetitive tasks.
But research by MIT’s David H. Autor and others finds that a large part of the widening income gap reflects increased competition from China.
That finding presents a dilemma to those who seek to promote equality for all.
The world as a whole is not a democracy and is unlikely to become one in the foreseeable future.
If politicians in Western democracies continue to promote policies that erode the boundaries of the nation-state, they will be voted out of office by working- and middle-class citizens who are in direct competition with low-skilled workers in the developing world.
Equality for all is an admirable goal.
But in striving to achieve that goal, we must not risk the domestic equality gains that two centuries of social progress have delivered.
Time for a Global Financial Makeover
NEW YORK – In 2015, United Nations member states came together and committed to achieving a comprehensive and universal set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) spanning all dimensions of economic and social development.
Investment will be indispensable to achieving the SDGs, which aim to eliminate poverty, end hunger, combat climate change, build resilient infrastructure, and promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
Yet, three years on, we still have not done nearly enough to leverage our financial systems in pursuit of the SDGs.
The UN, in coordination with almost 60 agencies and international institutions, recently published an assessment of the world’s progress toward changing financing, policies, and regulations to achieve the SDGs.
It finds that, despite positive momentum on sustainable investment, the goals will not be met unless we shift the entire financial system toward long-term investment horizons, and make sustainability a central concern.
Without a long-term perspective, certain risks, especially those associated with climate change, will not be priced into private investment decisions.
Global financial flows are vast, yet the quality of investment matters.
Currently, short-term investment patterns are driving capital-market and exchange-rate volatility, and significantly raising the costs and risks of sustainable investment, particularly for developing countries.
If we create incentives to steer the flow of financing toward long-term infrastructure projects like bridges, roads, and water and sewage systems, we would be making a major contribution to both development and stability.
And those investment projects must be more environmentally and socially sustainable.
Because today’s investments, particularly in energy systems, will lock in development paths for decades to come, more must be done to ensure that investments now, and in the future, do not undermine our efforts to address climate change.
Moreover, as with all economic policies, gender equality needs to become a central consideration.
Transforming finance will not be easy.
Today’s capital markets are highly oriented toward short-termism, as evidenced by capital-flow volatility and the short holding period of stocks in some developed markets, which has fallen from an average of eight years in the 1960s to eight months today.
And while long-term institutional investors hold around $80 trillion in assets, with about half of these representing long-term liabilities, nearly 75% are held in liquid instruments, whereas just 3% are in infrastructure.
The same tendency is prevalent in the real economy.
In 2016, S&P 500 companies spent more than 100% of their earnings on dividends and share buybacks, which boost stock prices in the short run, rather than raising long-term value through investment.
A February 2017 McKinsey Global Institute survey found that 87% of corporate executives and directors feel “pressured to demonstrate strong financial performance within two years or less,” while 65% say that “short-term pressure has increased over the past five years.”
Moreover, 55% said they would delay investments in projects with positive returns in order to hit quarterly balance-sheet targets.
Shifting investors from short-termism toward long-term thinking is a prerequisite for achieving all of our economic, social, and environmental goals.
But the private sector will not make this transition by itself.
Policymakers must step in and provide leadership.
Markets do not operate fairly and in the public interest without well-considered and well-enforced rules set by governments.
Aside from public investment, this is one of the state’s most essential functions.
Specifically, transforming global finance will require changes in prudential regulations, capital requirements, investment-firm culture, and executive compensation, which will require new and more appropriate longer-term benchmarks.
Reforms to accounting practices, especially for illiquid investments, will also be necessary, for example, to reduce the short-term bias introduced by mark-to-market accounting.
And institutional investors must adopt a broader interpretation of fiduciary duty, which should focus on the long term and incorporate all factors that have a material impact on returns, be they financial, environmental, social, or governance-related.
With 12 years to go, it may seem like the world has plenty of time to make progress toward the SDGs.
But the UN’s past experiences with goal-oriented initiatives show that it is important to take decisive action early on in the process.
Making matters worse, escalating geopolitical and trade tensions threaten to set us back, rather than take us forward.
Such disagreements must not stand in the way of reaching the SDGs and building a sustainable future.
Above all, that future needs to be financed.
Though many public and private institutions at various levels of international finance have already started to change, the overall financial system has yet to experience the sort of transformation that is needed.
We have all agreed on what we need to do; now we must do it.
Global Finance and Global Warming
NEW DELHI/LONDON – Since 2008, when the global financial crisis nearly brought down the world economy, financial reform has been among the top items on policymakers’ agendas.
But, as leaders move from fixing the problems of the past to positioning the financial system for the future, they must also grapple with new threats to its stability, particularly those stemming from climate change.
That is why a growing number of governments, regulators, standard-setters, and market actors are starting to incorporate rules concerning sustainability into the financial system.
In Brazil, the central bank views the integration of environmental and social factors into risk management as a way to strengthen resilience.
And in countries like Singapore and South Africa, companies listed on the stock market are obligated to disclose their environmental and social performance, a requirement that investors and regulators increasingly view as essential to the efficient functioning of financial markets.
Initiatives like these might once have been regarded as part of a peripheral “green” niche.
Today, they are considered central to the operation of the financial system.
In Bangladesh, the central bank’s efforts to support economic development include low-cost refinancing for banks lending to projects that meet goals for renewables, energy efficiency, or waste management.
In the United Kingdom, the Bank of England is currently evaluating the implications of climate change for the insurance sector as part of its core mandate to oversee the safety and soundness of financial institutions.
In China, annual investment in green industry could reach $320 billion in the next five years, with the government able to provide only 10-15% of the total.
In order to prevent a funding shortfall, the People’s Bank of China has recently produced a report with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) setting out a comprehensive set of recommendations for establishing China’s “green financial system.”
In India, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry has established a new “green bond” working group to explore how the country’s debt markets can respond to the challenge of financing smart infrastructure.
And recent regulatory changes hold out considerable potential for listed investment trusts to deploy capital for clean energy.
So far, such measures affect only a small fraction of the $305 trillion in assets held by banks, investors, financial institutions, and individuals in the global financial system.
But they are set to be applied more broadly as financiers and regulators alike recognize the full consequences of environmental dislocation.
Those consequences already are severe.
In 116 of 140 countries assessed by UNEP, the stock of natural capital that underpins value creation is in decline.
The human and economic costs of continued high-carbon growth include severe health impacts, growing disruption to infrastructure, and water and food security, as well as increasing market volatility, most notably in developing countries.
This damage will become worse, with risks becoming unmanageable if emissions of greenhouse gases are not reduced to net zero levels between 2055 and 2070.
As the threat from climate change becomes more evident, financing the response to its impact will become increasingly important.
Developed countries have committed to mobilize $100 billion in annual financial flows to developing countries by 2020, but much more is needed.
Above all, it is essential to place the financing challenge posed by climate change within the broader context of the green economy and sustainable development.
The task for those charged with governing the financial system is to enable the orderly transition from high- to low-carbon investments and from vulnerable to resilient assets.
According to the New Climate Economy initiative, $89 trillion will be spent on global infrastructure investment by 2030 – with an additional $4.1 trillion needed to make it low-carbon and resilient.
To mobilize the required capital, policymakers will need to harness the power of the financial system.
The scope of risk management will need to be expanded, so that long-term sustainability and risks from climate change are included in prudential rules for banking, insurance, and investment.
New “green banks” can help to bring in funding from debt and equity markets.
Transparency will have to be improved, through better corporate reporting and enhanced disclosure from financial institutions.
And financial professionals’ skills and incentives will have to be retooled and revised to reflect these new priorities.
Promising avenues for international cooperation are now opening up.
For example, the G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors have just asked the Financial Stability Board to explore how the financial sector could address climate issues.
Actions such as these will not only strengthen climate security; they will also contribute to a more efficient, effective, and resilient financial system.
Global Finance’s Supply-Chain Revolution
HONG KONG – In March 2011, the catastrophic earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that hit Japan halted production of key components on which many global supply chains depend.
The sudden disruption of these essential materials from the production process forced a reassessment of how these supply chains function.
But such vulnerabilities are not confined to the manufacturing sector.
The finance industry, too, has suffered its own near “supply chain” meltdown in recent times.
The failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008 not only roiled global financial markets, but also brought global trade practically to a standstill as wholesale banks refused to fund each other for fear of counterparty failure.
The simple banking system of the past, one based on retail savings being concentrated in order to fund the credit needs of borrowers, had evolved into a highly complex – and global – supply chain with knock-on risks of disruption comparable to those seen in Japan last spring.
Financial supply chains and those in the manufacturing sector share three key features – architecture, feedback mechanisms, and processes – and their robustness and efficiency depend upon how these components interact.
In today’s financial architecture, as with other supply chains, interdependent networks tend to concentrate in powerful hubs.
For example, just two financial centers, London and New York, dominate international finance, and only 22 players conduct 90% of all global foreign-exchange trading.
Such concentration is very efficient, but it also contributes to greater systemic risks, because, if the leading hubs fail, the whole system can collapse.
Open feedback mechanisms ensure a supply chain’s ability to respond to a changing environment, but, in the case of financial supply chains, feedback mechanisms can amplify shocks until the whole system blows up.
The Lehman Brothers collapse triggered just such an explosion, with the financial system saved only by government bailouts.
Finally, the processes within supply chains, and the feedback interactions between them, can make the system greater or smaller than the sum of its parts.
Since a complex network comprises linkages between many sub-networks, individual inefficiencies or weaknesses can have an impact on the viability of the whole.
Like manufacturing supply chains in the wake of the Japanese disruption, financial supply chains face formidable pressures to re-engineer and adapt as the global economic balance shifts towards emerging markets.
As that happens, billions of consumers will enter these countries’ middle classes, new social networks will evolve, and climate change will become a growing factor in global commerce.
In addition, major regulatory reforms will impose new and higher costs on the financial sector.
Banks and other institutions are also under pressure to devise new financial products that can help the real sector to manage more complex risks and enable investment in areas such as green technology and infrastructure for developing economies.
Moreover, global financial stability now depends upon greater cooperation at the international level, with tighter enforcement of rules at the national level.
It is also clear that emerging markets are searching for alternative growth models that are green and sustainable.
Their financial sectors will have to operate very differently from the current model, which is driven by consumption.
In a world in which both consumption and finance must grow more slowly to cope with global resource and environmental constraints, what role can finance play in reducing addictive consumption, funded by unsustainable leverage?
And, given that financial institutions will have to monitor and manage risk in a radically different manner, both for themselves and their customers, what is the role of distribution in a world where consumption, savings, and investment will accelerate in volatility?
Financial “production” is currently a top-down process.
Instruments are designed in such a way that their sales generate more profits for financial engineers than for end users.
But the rise of interactive social networking has made financial innovation more bottom-up.
Millions of bank customers using mobile phones can provide immediate feedback on which products and services they like or dislike.
In the future, client-service and transaction-management systems will receive more input from customers more frequently, so that product design is shaped interactively.
The current strategy in the financial sector drives excessive competition by increasing market share at rivals’ expense, often breaking trust with customers for the sake of short-term gains.
Yet the financial sector has, in previous eras, proven that it can operate as a public good by providing trustworthy, efficient services.
The winning financial supply chains of the future will instill confidence that they offer safe, stable, and efficient services to the most clients.
Innovation in the last century focused on processes, products, and services.
Today, the financial sector needs innovation of a higher order, involving business models, strategy, and management approaches that restore trust in finance.
Just as Steve Jobs of Apple transformed the computer industry through lifestyle products and highly reliable, user-friendly, and “cool” services, financial institutions will have to introduce new value chains that create confidence by adapting to the growing needs of new markets.
Given such profound changes, financial leaders should think about how to orchestrate a new financial supply chain – the “killer app” for our still new century.
2008 Revisited?
NEW YORK – The question I am asked most often nowadays is this: Are we back to 2008 and another global financial crisis and recession?
My answer is a straightforward no, but that the recent episode of global financial market turmoil is likely to be more serious than any period of volatility and risk-off behavior since 2009.
This is because there are now at least seven sources of global tail risk, as opposed to the single factors – the eurozone crisis, the Federal Reserve “taper tantrum,” a possible Greek exit from the eurozone, and a hard economic landing in China – that have fueled volatility in recent years.
First, worries about a hard landing in China and its likely impact on the stock market and the value of the renminbi have returned with a vengeance.
While China is more likely to have a bumpy landing than a hard one, investors’ concerns have yet to be laid to rest, owing to the ongoing growth slowdown and continued capital flight.
Second, emerging markets are in serious trouble.
They face global headwinds (China’s slowdown, the end of the commodity super cycle, the Fed’s exit from zero policy rates).
Many are running macro imbalances, such as twin current account and fiscal deficits, and confront rising inflation and slowing growth.
Most have not implemented structural reforms to boost sagging potential growth.
And currency weakness increases the real value of trillions of dollars of debt built up in the last decade.
Third, the Fed probably erred in exiting its zero-interest-rate policy in December.
Weaker growth, lower inflation (owing to a further decline in oil prices), and tighter financial conditions (via a stronger dollar, a corrected stock market, and wider credit spreads) now threaten US growth and inflation expectations.
Fourth, many simmering geopolitical risks are coming to a boil.
Perhaps the most immediate source of uncertainty is the prospect of a long-term cold war – punctuated by proxy conflicts – between the Middle East’s regional powers, particularly Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shia Iran.
Fifth, the decline in oil prices is triggering falls in US and global equities and spikes in credit spreads.
This may now signal weak global demand – rather than rising supply – as growth in China, emerging markets, and the US slows.
Weak oil prices also damage US energy producers, which comprise a large share of the US stock market, and impose credit losses and potential defaults on net energy exporting economies, their sovereigns, state-owned enterprises, and energy firms.
As regulations restrict market makers from providing liquidity and absorbing market volatility, every fundamental shock becomes more severe in terms of risk-asset price corrections.
Sixth, global banks are challenged by lower returns, owing to the new regulations put in place since 2008, the rise of financial technology that threatens to disrupt their already-challenged business models, the growing use of negative policy rates, rising credit losses on bad assets (energy, commodities, emerging markets, fragile European corporate borrowers), and the movement in Europe to “bail in” banks’ creditors, rather than bail them out with now-restricted state aid.
Finally, the European Union and the eurozone could be ground zero of global financial turmoil this year.
European banks are challenged.
The migration crisis could lead to the end of the Schengen Agreement, and (together with other domestic troubles) to the end of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government.
Moreover, Britain’s exit from the EU is becoming more likely.
With the Greek government and its creditors once again on a collision course, the risk of Greece’s exit may return.
Populist parties of the right and the left are gaining strength throughout Europe.
Thus, Europe increasingly risks disintegration.
To top it all off, its neighborhood is unsafe, with wars raging not only in the Middle East, but also – despite repeated attempts by the EU to broker peace – in Ukraine, while Russia is becoming more aggressive on Europe’s borders, from the Baltics to the Balkans.
In the past, tail risks were more occasional, growth scares turned out to be just that, and the policy response was strong and effective, thereby keeping risk-off episodes brief and restoring asset prices to their previous highs (if not taking them even higher).
Today, there are seven sources of potential global tail risk, and the global economy is moving from an anemic expansion (positive growth that accelerates) to a slowdown (positive growth that decelerates), which will lead to further reduction in the price of risky assets (equities, commodities, credit) worldwide.
At the same time, the policies that stopped and reversed the doom loop between the real economy and risk assets are running out of steam.
The policy mix is suboptimal, owing to excessive reliance on monetary rather than fiscal policy.
Indeed, monetary policies are becoming increasingly unconventional, reflected in the move by several central banks to negative real policy rates; and such unconventional policies risk doing more harm than good as they hurt the profitability of banks and other financial firms.
Two dismal months for financial markets may give way in March to a relief rally for assets such as global equities, as some key central banks (the People’s Bank of China, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan) ease more, while others (the Fed and the Bank of England) will remain on hold for longer.
But repeated eruptions from some of the seven sources of global tail risk will make the rest of this year – unlike the previous seven – a bad one for risky assets and anemic for global growth.
The Global Financial System’s Weakened Defenses
ZURICH – Eighty-five years ago this month, Credit-Anstalt, by far the largest bank in Austria, collapsed.
By that July, banks in Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Turkey had experienced runs.
A banking panic hit the United States in August, though the sources of that panic may have been domestic.
In September, banks in the United Kingdom experienced large withdrawals.
The parallels to the 2008 collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers are strong – and crucial for understanding today’s financial risks.
For starters, neither the collapse of Credit-Anstalt nor that of Lehman Brothers caused all of the global financial tumult that ensued.
Those collapses and the subsequent problems were symptoms of the same disease: a weak banking system.
In Austria in 1931, the problem was rooted in the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I, hyperinflation in the early 1920s, and banks’ excessive exposure to the industrial sector.
By the time Credit-Anstalt collapsed, the world had been in deep recession for two years, banking systems in a number of countries had become fragile, and tensions were easily transmitted across national borders, with the gold standard exacerbating financial vulnerability by constraining central banks’ ability to act.
Similarly, in 2008, the entire financial system was overextended, owing to a combination of weak internal risk management and inadequate government regulation and supervision.
Lehman Brothers was simply the weakest link in a long chain of brittle financial firms.
Could a crisis like those triggered by the Credit-Anstalt and the Lehman Brothers collapse happen today?
One is tempted to say no.
After all, the global economy and the financial system appear to be on the mend; risk-taking in the private sector has been reduced; and huge, though burdensome, regulatory improvements have been undertaken.
Taken together, these developments surely make for a stable financial system.
The problem with this reasoning is that financial crises tend to reveal fault lines that were not visible before.
Indeed, the financial sector manages the risks that it recognizes, not necessarily all the risks that it runs.
And it is easy to overestimate the crisis-preventing power of the new regulatory environment, which is analogous to a new highway: It is technically safer than a country road, but it also attracts more cars that are traveling at much higher speeds, so traffic accidents continue.
Unable to rule out a new crisis, how well are we equipped to cope with one?
The short answer is: not very.
In fact, if a financial crisis were to occur today, its consequences for the real economy might be even more severe than in the past.
Of course, because central banks now recognize that their responsibilities extend beyond stabilizing prices to include the prevention and management of financial tensions, they would undoubtedly be quick to respond to any shock with a battery of market operations.
But, in the event of a crisis, the tools available to central banks to prevent deflation and a collapse of the real economy are severely constrained, especially today.
In the early twentieth century, central banks could all devalue their currencies against gold, thereby raising the price level and escaping debt deflation.
And, indeed, nine countries, including the UK, did exactly that in 1931, with another eight countries, including the US, following suit over the next five years.
Today, however, currency depreciation is a zero-sum game.
Without the joint-depreciation option, central banks responded to the 2008 crisis with interest-rate cuts that were unprecedented in scope, size, and speed, as well as massive purchases of long-term securities (so-called quantitative easing, or QE).
And those efforts were effective.
But interest rates remain extremely low, and are even negative in some countries, and QE has been taken close to its limits, with public support for the policy waning.
As a result, these tools’ ability to cushion an economy against further shocks is severely constrained.
While forward guidance by central banks has also helped, it, too, is unlikely to be able to provide an effective buffer against a new shock.
None of this is to say that another global financial crisis is necessarily imminent.
On the contrary, economies worldwide are making progress in recovering from the 2008 disaster, and the US Federal Reserve’s tightening of policy last December signals that the global interest-rate cycle is moving into the next phase.
This is good news.
But the danger of another financial crisis should not be ruled out.
Indeed, given that the capacity of central banks to cope with a financial shock will remain woefully limited for years to come, it should be taken very seriously. The risks of complacency are simply too great.
Financial Investors’ Wish List for 2018
NEWPORT BEACH – If financial investors were to write letters to Santa Claus this Christmas, they would probably be tempted to ask for the continuation of the unusual combination of factors that has dominated over the last year: ultra-low market volatility, booming financial-asset values, correlations that lower the cost of portfolio risk mitigation, and promising new opportunities (such as Bitcoin).
But before making their wish list, investors should consider the longer-term risks associated with the decoupling of financial markets from economic and policy fundamentals.
Investors could be forgiven for hoping for more of the same.
After all, with less than a month to go, 2017 is on course to be a hugely, if not historically rewarding year for them.
As of December 12, global stock markets, and in particular the S&P index, had returned around 20% for the year – and this on top of an already-strong multi-year run.
Add to that unusually low volatility – in the US, 2017 so far has shown the lowest daily loss in the entire history of the S&P 500 index – and there has been little to keep investors up at night.
Usually, such strong stock returns are accompanied by lower prices for government bonds – the so-called negative correlation between risky and safe assets.
Not so in 2017.
Despite the impressive equity rally, the price of longer-term US Treasury bills was higher at the beginning of December than at the start of the year.
And then there is the precipitous rise of the crypto-currency Bitcoin.
With its price having surged by an eye-popping amount this year (from around $1,000 to over $16,000 as of December 12), even a small allocation of Bitcoin has made a material difference in investors’ portfolios.
Five main factors have enabled this unusual situation.
· A synchronized pickup in global economic growth, which continues to strengthen.
· Progress in the United States on pro-growth policies.
· Skillful normalization of monetary policy (which is still ongoing) by the US Federal Reserve.
· Passive investment products attracting large inflows.
· Continued large liquidity injections from three big central banks – the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the European Central Bank (ECB), the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) – which, together with cash-rich corporate balance sheets, have served to lower funding costs for a significant set of households and corporates.
Now for the less exuberant news: without continued economic and policy improvements, the factors that have delighted investors in 2017 risk generating an unpleasant reversal of fortune.
This year’s strong performance has, after all, been buoyed significantly by “borrowed” returns from future years.
With regard to mitigating portfolio risk, the increase in government bond prices leaves little room for this traditionally safe asset to compensate for a possible decline in stocks.
Given how many value-at-risk-based models work, the persistence of low volatility has resulted in a crowded trade in a number of areas, which could turn out to be technically fragile.
As for Bitcoin, its vertiginous rise – fueled in part by the growing participation of institutional investors – may imply that it is on the path toward broad acceptance.
But it may also turn out to be little more than a large financial bubble, implying serious damage when it inevitably collapses.
What, then, should investors really be hoping for in the coming year?
In general, the top priority must be improvement in economic and policy fundamentals to the point that they better validate existing elevated asset prices, while laying a foundation for greater gains over time.
Achieving this would require, in the US, the expansion of pro-growth policies, which, as recently announced by Donald Trump’s administration, would include adding an infrastructure plan to deregulation and tax measures.
European countries should also pursue more focused pro-growth measures at the national level, while supporting stronger regional efforts, facilitated by a reinvigorated reform-minded Franco-German leadership and a relatively orderly Brexit process.
As for Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should take advantage of his commanding majority in the Diet, won in October’s snap general election, to implement the third “arrow” of Abenomics: pro-growth structural reforms.
Finally, to promote stable growth, all of the world’s systemically important central banks – notably, the Fed, the BOJ, the ECB, and the PBOC – would need to continue coordinating their strategies, with a view to ensuring consistent monetary-policy stances.
Only with such efforts can the current pickup in global growth develop the structural roots that are needed to make it durable, balanced, and inclusive over the medium term.
This is all the more critical at a time of fluid geopolitical risk and uncertain productivity, wage, and inflation dynamics.
However tempting it may be to focus our holiday wishes on our own immediate desires, it is imperative this year that investors’ wish lists take into account the big economic and policy picture.
What Role for Global Governance?
WASHINGTON, DC – Can global governance solve most of our economic problems?
Or does it too often promise more than it can deliver, and divert attention from more practical reforms that national governments should implement?
In a recent commentary, Harvard University economist Dani Rodrik thoughtfully argues the latter.
Is he right?
To be sure, national policy has a more direct effect – good or bad – on a country’s citizens.
But we cannot ignore the global effects of bad national policies, the most obvious examples noted by Rodrik being greenhouse-gas emissions and infectious diseases.
People in the “country of origin” may pay a price, but so will the rest of us.
“Globalization” has been a catchword for decades, and the need for global governance has admittedly been exaggerated in recent years, especially by those on the center left.
This has led to calls for new alternatives, such as “responsible nationalism” or “inter-governmental” – as opposed to supranational – decision-making in the European Union.
Such proposals make for a healthy debate.
For example, we should reevaluate the current system for deciding trade agreements, which have become more about regulatory and investment issues than about eliminating import tariffs or other import barriers.
It is no surprise that even some free-trade supporters object to agreements that allow trade groups to insert language granting multinational corporations undue market power at the expense of consumer protection.
Still, the push for stronger global governance in recent years has not happened in a vacuum.
Countries have undoubtedly become more economically and socially interdependent, owing to trade, travel, and telecommunications, not to mention multinational corporate structures and international financial flows.
Global intercourse is broader, faster, and more ubiquitous than ever before.
Globalization may occasionally hit speed bumps, such as the current slowdown in world trade; but the underlying technological changes driving interconnectivity will only continue to bring people and countries closer together.
Ultimately, this is for the best, because the major challenges we face today are global in nature.
Efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change will require consistent global coordination.
Even local initiatives, which are increasingly important for addressing the problem, must fit into a framework of converging global policies and obligations.
Otherwise, people will not feel as though they are making a difference or contributing to a shared goal, and others will not feel pressure to do anything at all.
Another global challenge is taxation, which requires international coordination to stanch rampant avoidance and evasion.
The problem is not just individual “tax havens”; there is also a need to capture corporate profits that companies’ move internationally with complex devices such as “transfer pricing” and “tax-base shifting” to minimize their tax bill.
Disparate tax rules among different countries have resulted in close to a zero-sum game for national governments, which are forced to pursue beggar-thy-neighbor policies to secure a bigger slice of a shrinking pie.
Under the current system, countries have strong incentives to offer ever-greater tax advantages to companies operating within their borders, even though they stand just as strong a chance of being undercut by another country as companies shift their declared profits from one jurisdiction to another.
In most cases, companies are not doing anything illegal by taking advantage of this fragmented system.
But if countries are serious about reducing inequality and funding pensions and health care for their citizens, they will have to cooperate in global-governance efforts to prioritize fair taxation.
Climate change and taxation are just two issues requiring global coordination, but the list goes on.
The monetary policies of large reserve-currency central banks such as the United States Federal Reserve can have far-reaching spillover effects, as can self-destructive exchange-rate policies or regulations on cross-border financial flows.
In most of these cases, the damage runs downstream from large countries to smaller countries; however, if enough small countries are affected, the aggregate damage can flow back to the larger economies themselves, as we’ve seen in the European debt crisis.
Given the scale of these challenges, we have no choice but to cooperate internationally and strengthen global and regional institutions and frameworks such as the International Monetary Fund, the EU, and the G20, which will meet in Hangzhou, China, next month.
But global governance is not an either/or proposition.
When national or local policies are sufficient to address a problem, then they should be pursued.
Indeed, the principle of subsidiarity – whereby decision-making should occur at the most local level possible – is crucial to flexible, functioning global governance.
The presence of global-governance frameworks should never become an excuse for national or local inaction.
Public policy is a multi-level and multi-channel effort with local, national, regional, and global dimensions.
Ideally, policy debates should acknowledge this reality.
We also must acknowledge the urgency of shoring up faith in global governance from another perspective.
Across the US, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, a resurgence of identity politics and xenophobic nationalism threatens to reprise the great tragedies of the twentieth century.
Against this backdrop, stressing the existence and needs of a global community is necessary not only for economic reasons, but also to help ensure a peaceful world.
The False Economic Promise of Global Governance
CAMBRIDGE – Global governance is the mantra of our era’s elite.
The surge in cross-border flows of goods, services, capital, and information produced by technological innovation and market liberalization has made the world’s countries too interconnected, their argument goes, for any country to be able to solve its economic problems on its own.
We need global rules, global agreements, global institutions.
This claim is so widely accepted today that challenging it may seem like arguing that the sun revolves around the earth.
Yet what may be true for truly global problems such as climate change or health pandemics is not true when it comes to most economic issues.
Contrary to what we often hear, the world economy is not a global commons.
Global governance can do only limited good – and it occasionally does some damage.
What makes, say, climate change a problem that requires global cooperation is that the planet has a single climate system.
It makes no difference where greenhouse gases are emitted.
So national restrictions on carbon emissions provide no or little benefit at home.
By contrast, good economic policies – including openness – benefit the domestic economy first and foremost, and the price of bad economic policies is primarily paid domestically as well.
Individual countries’ economic fortunes are determined largely by what happens at home rather than abroad.
If economic openness is desirable, it is because such policies are in a country’s own self-interest – not because it helps others.
Openness and other good policies that contribute to economic stability worldwide rely on self-interest, not on global spirit.
Sometimes domestic economic advantage comes at the expense of other countries.
This is the case of so-called beggar-thy-neighbor policies.
The purest illustration occurs when a dominant supplier of a natural resource, such as oil, restricts supply on world markets to drive up world prices.
The exporter’s gain is the rest of the world’s loss.
A similar mechanism underpins “optimum tariffs,” whereby a large country manipulates its terms of trade by placing restrictions on its imports.
In such instances, there is a clear argument for global rules that limit or prohibit the use of such policies.
But the vast majority of the issues in world trade and finance that preoccupy policymakers are not of this kind.
Consider, for example, Europe’s agricultural subsidies and ban on genetically modified organisms, the abuse of antidumping rules in the United States, or inadequate protection of investors’ rights in developing countries.
These are essentially “beggar thyself” policies.
Their economic costs are borne primarily at home, even though they may produce adverse effects for others as well.
For example, economists generally agree that agricultural subsidies are inefficient and that the benefits to European farmers come at large costs to everyone else in Europe, in the form of high prices, high taxes, or both.
Such policies are deployed not to extract advantages from other countries, but because other competing domestic objectives – distributional, administrative, or related to public health – dominate economy-wide motives.
The same is true of poor banking regulations or macroeconomic policies that aggravate the business cycle and generate financial instability.
As the 2008 global financial crisis showed, the implications beyond a country’s own borders can be momentous.
But if US regulators fell asleep on the job, it was not because their economy benefited while everyone else paid the price.
The US economy was among those that suffered most.
Perhaps the biggest policy letdown of our day is the failure of governments in advanced democracies to address rising inequality.
This, too, has its roots in domestic politics – financial and business elites’ grip on the policymaking process and the narratives they have spun about the limits of redistributive policies.
To be sure, global tax havens are an example of beggar-thy-neighbor policies.
But powerful countries such as the US and European Union members could have done much on their own to limit tax evasion – and the race to the bottom in corporate taxation – if they so desired.
So the problems of our day have little to do with a lack of global cooperation.
They are domestic in nature and cannot be fixed by rule making through international institutions, which are easily overwhelmed by the same vested interests that undermine domestic policy.
Too often, global governance is another name for the pursuit of these interests’ global agenda, which is why it ends up mainly furthering globalization and harmonizing domestic economic policies.
An alternative agenda for global governance would focus on improving how democracies function at home, without prejudging what the policy outputs ought to be.
This would be a democracy-enhancing rather than globalization-enhancing model of global governance.
What I have in mind is the creation of global norms and procedural requirements designed to enhance the quality of domestic policymaking.
Global disciplines pertaining to transparency, broad representation, accountability, and use of scientific or economic evidence in domestic proceedings – without constraining the end result – are examples of such requirements.
Global institutions already use disciplines of this type to some extent.
For example, the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement) explicitly requires the use of scientific evidence when health concerns are at issue for imported goods.
Procedural rules of this kind can be used much more extensively and to greater effect to improve domestic decision-making.
Anti-dumping rules can also be improved by requiring that consumer and producer interests that would be adversely affected by import duties take part in domestic proceedings.
Subsidy rules can be improved by requiring economic cost-benefit analyses that incorporate potential consequences for both static and dynamic efficiency.
Problems rooted in failures of domestic deliberation can be solved only through improved democratic decision-making.
Global governance can make only a very limited contribution here – and only if it focuses on enhancing domestic decision-making rather than constraining it.
Otherwise, the goal of global governance embodies a yearning for technocratic solutions that override and undercut public deliberation.
The Global Growth Funk
NEW YORK – The International Monetary Fund and others have recently revised downward their forecasts for global growth – yet again.
Little wonder: The world economy has few bright spots – and many that are dimming rapidly.
Among advanced economies, the United States has just experienced two quarters of growth averaging 1%.
Further monetary easing has boosted a cyclical recovery in the eurozone, though potential growth in most countries remains well below 1%.
In Japan, “Abenomics” is running out of steam, with the economy slowing since mid-2015 and now close to recession.
In the United Kingdom, uncertainty surrounding the June referendum on continued European Union membership is leading firms to keep hiring and capital spending on hold.
And other advanced economies – such as Canada, Australia, Norway – face headwinds from low commodity prices.
Things are not much better in most emerging economies.
Among the five BRICS countries, two (Brazil and Russia) are in recession, one (South Africa) is barely growing, another (China) is experiencing a sharp structural slowdown, and India is doing well only because – in the words of its central bank governor, Raghuram Rajan – in the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
Many other emerging markets have slowed since 2013 as well, owing to weak external conditions, economic fragility (stemming from loose monetary, fiscal, and credit policies in the good years), and, often, a move away from market-oriented reforms and toward variants of state capitalism.
Worse, potential growth has also fallen in both advanced and emerging economies.
For starters, high levels of private and public debt are constraining spending – especially growth-enhancing capital spending, which fell (as a share of GDP) after the global financial crisis and has not recovered to pre-crisis levels.
That falloff in investment implies slower productivity growth, while aging populations in developed countries – and now in an increasing number of emerging markets (for example, China, Russia, and Korea) – reduce the labor input in production.
The rise in income and wealth inequality exacerbates the global saving glut (which is the counterpart of the global investment slump).
As income is redistributed from labor to capital, it flows from those who have a higher marginal propensity to spend (low- and middle-income households) to those who have a higher marginal propensity to save (high-income households and corporations).
Moreover, a protracted cyclical slump can lead to lower trend growth.
Economists call this “hysteresis”: Long-term unemployment erodes workers’ skills and human capital; and, because innovation is embedded in new capital goods, low investment leads to permanently lower productivity growth.
Finally, with so many factors dragging down potential growth, structural reforms are needed to boost potential growth.
But such reforms are occurring at suboptimal rates in both advanced and emerging economies, because all of the costs and dislocations are frontloaded, while the benefits occur over the medium and long term.
This gives opponents of reform a political advantage.
Meanwhile, actual growth remains below the diminished potential.
A painful deleveraging process implies that private and public spending need to fall, and that savings must rise, to reduce high deficits and debts.
This process started in the US after the housing bust, then spread to Europe, and is now ongoing in emerging markets that spent the last decade on a borrowing binge.
At the same time, the policy mix has not been ideal.
With most advanced economies pivoting too quickly to fiscal retrenchment, the burden of reviving growth was placed almost entirely on unconventional monetary policies, which have diminishing returns (if not counter-productive effects).
Asymmetric adjustment between debtor and creditor economies has also undermined growth.
The former, having overspent and under-saved, had to spend less and save more when markets forced them to do so, whereas the latter were not forced to spend more and save less.
This exacerbated the global savings glut and global investment slump.
Finally, hysteresis further weakened actual growth.
A cyclical slump reduced potential growth, and the reduction in potential growth prospects led to further cyclical weakness, as spending declines when expectations are revised downward.
There are no politically easy solutions to the global economy’s current quandary.
Unsustainably high debt should be reduced in a rapid and orderly fashion, to avoid a long and protracted (often a decade or longer) deleveraging process.
But orderly debt-reduction mechanisms are not available for sovereign countries and are politically difficult to implement within countries for households, firms, and financial institutions.
Likewise, structural and market-oriented reforms are necessary to boost potential growth.
But, given the timing of costs and benefits, such measures are especially unpopular if an economy is already in a slump.
It will be no less difficult to leave behind unconventional monetary policies, as the US Federal Reserve recently suggested by signaling that it will normalize policy interest rates more slowly than expected.
Meanwhile, fiscal policy – especially productive public investment that boosts both the demand and supply sides – remains hostage to high debts and misguided austerity, even in countries with the financial capacity to undertake a slower consolidation.
Thus, for the time being, we are likely to remain in what the IMF calls the “new mediocre,” Larry Summers calls “secular stagnation,” and the Chinese call the “new normal.”
But make no mistake: There is nothing normal or healthy about economic performance that is increasing inequality and, in many countries, leading to a populist backlash – both on the right and the left – against trade, globalization, migration, technological innovation, and market-oriented policies.
Growing Out of Populism?
CAMBRIDGE – After nine dreary years of downgrading their GDP forecasts, macroeconomic policymakers around the world are shaking their heads in disbelief: Despite a populist-propelled wave of political tumult, global growth is actually set to outperform expectations in 2017.
It’s not just American exceptionalism.
Although US growth is very strong, Europe has been outperforming expectations by more.
There is even happy news for emerging markets, which are still bracing for US Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes but have gained a better backdrop against which to adjust.
The broad story behind the global reflation is easy enough to understand.
Deep, systemic financial crises lead to deep, prolonged recessions.
As Carmen Reinhart and I predicted a decade ago (and as numerous other scholars have since corroborated using our data), periods of 6-8 years of very slow growth are not at all unusual in such circumstances.
True, many problems remain, including weak banks in Europe, over-leveraged local governments in China, and needlessly complicated financial regulation in the United States.
Nonetheless, the seeds of a sustained period of more solid growth have been planted.
But will the populist tide surging across the advanced economies drown the accelerating recovery?
Or will the recovery stifle leaders who confidently espouse seductively simple solutions to genuinely complex problems?
With the International Monetary Fund/World Bank meetings coming up later this month in Washington, DC, leading central bankers and finance ministers will have ringside seats at Ground Zero.
Who can doubt that US President Donald Trump will make a Twitter punching bag out of any of them who dares criticize his administration’s planned retreat from open trade and leadership in multilateral financial institutions?
Before then, Trump will host Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, his “winter White House.”
It is hard to overstate how much rides on the Sino-US relationship, and how damaging it would be if the two sides could not find a way to work together constructively.
The Trump administration believes that it has the bargaining tools to recalibrate the relationship to America’s advantage, including a tariff on Chinese imports or even selectively defaulting on the more than $1 trillion the US owes to China.
But a tariff would eventually be overturned by the World Trade Organization, and a default on US debt would be even more reckless.
If Trump can persuade China to open up its economy more to US exports, and to help rein in North Korea, he will have achieved something.
But if his plan is for the US to retreat unilaterally from global trade, the outcome is likely to hurt many US workers for the benefit of a few.
The threat to globalism seems to have waned in Europe, with populist candidates having lost elections in Austria, the Netherlands, and now Germany.
But a populist turn in upcoming elections in either France or Italy could still tear apart the European Union, causing massive collateral damage to the rest of the world.
French Presidential candidate Marine Le Pen wants to kill off the EU because, she says, “the people of Europe do not want it anymore.”
And while opinion polls have the pro-EU Emmanuel Macron beating Le Pen decisively in the election’s second-round runoff on May 7, it is hard to be confident in the outcome of a two-person race, especially given Russian President Vladimir Putin’s support for Le Pen.
Given the unpredictability of an angry electorate, and Russia’s proven capacity to manipulate news and social media, it would be folly to think that Macron is a lock.
Italy’s election is not for another year, but the situation is even worse.
There, populist candidate Beppe Grillo is leading polls and is expected to pull in about a third of the popular vote.
Like Le Pen, Grillo wants to pull the plug on the euro.
And, while it is hard to imagine a more chaotic event for the global economy, it is also hard to know the way forward for Italy, where per capita income has actually fallen slightly during the euro era.
With flat population growth and swelling debt (over 140% of GDP), Italy’s economic prospects appear bleak.
Though most economists still think exiting the euro would be profoundly self-destructive, a growing number have come to believe that the euro will never work for Italy, and that the sooner it leaves the better.
Many emerging-market countries are dealing with populists of their own, or in the case of Poland, Hungary, and Turkey, with populists who have already turned into autocrats.
Fortunately, a patient Fed, a resilient (for now) China, and a growing Europe and US will help most emerging economies.
The outlook for global growth is improving, and, with sensible policies, the next several years could be quite a bit better than the last – certainly for advanced economies, and perhaps for most others as well.
But populism remains a wildcard, and only if growth picks up fast enough is it likely to be kept out of play.
A Year of Successes in Global Health
BANGKOK – In the field of human development, the year that just ended was better than many predicted it would be.
A decade after the Great Recession began, economic recovery continued in 2017, and progress was made on issues like poverty, education, and global warming.
But perhaps the most significant achievements of the last 12 months were in global health.
I count 18 unique successes in 2017, many of which will help sow the seeds of progress for the months and years ahead.
The first notable success occurred early in the year, when a Guinness World Record was set for the most donations of medication made during a 24-hour period.
On January 30, more than 207 million drug doses were donated to treat neglected tropical diseases including guinea-worm disease, leprosy, and trachoma.
This extraordinary feat was made possible by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and by pharmaceutical firms including Bayer, Novartis, Pfizer, and my company, Sanofi Pasteur.
India’s elimination of active trachoma was another milestone, as it marked an important turning point in the global fight against a leading infectious cause of blindness.
Last year, trachoma was also eliminated in Mexico, Cambodia, and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.
A third key health trend in 2017 was further progress toward the elimination of human onchocerciasis, which causes blindness, impaired vision, and skin infections.
Fourth on my list is a dramatic drop in the number of guinea-worm disease infections.
A mere 26 cases were recorded worldwide in 2017, down from 3.5 million cases in 1986.
Efforts to eradicate leprosy earned the fifth spot on my list, while vaccine advances in general were sixth.
Highlights included a new typhoid vaccine, shown to improve protection for infants and young children, and a new shingles vaccine.
Number seven is the dramatic progress made in eliminating measles.
Four countries – Bhutan, the Maldives, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom – were all declared measles-free last year.
The war on Zika is number eight on my list of health achievements in 2017.
Thanks to coordinated global efforts, most people in Latin America and the Caribbean are now immune to the mosquito-borne virus, and experts believe transmission will continue to slow.
Number nine is polio eradication.
Fewer than 20 new cases were reported globally, a 99% reduction since 1988.
Although the year ended with reports of cases in Pakistan, health experts remain optimistic that polio can be fully eradicated in 2018.
Rounding out my top ten was the creation of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which was established to develop vaccines for infectious disease threats.
Launched with nearly $600 million in funding from Germany, Japan, Norway, the UK charity Wellcome Trust, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CEPI aims to reduce sharply the time it takes to develop and produce vaccines.
Huge gains in disease control and prevention were made last year, and the next few items on my list (11 through 16) reflect progress on specific illnesses.
For example, rates of premature death fell for non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory conditions.
Another highlight was the historic approval of a sophisticated cancer treatment, CAR T-cell therapy, which uses a patient’s own immune cells to attack tumors.
Improvements were also made in treating HIV.
Clinical trials for an HIV vaccine started at the end of 2017, while doctors in South Africa reported curing a young boy of the disease after he received treatments as an infant.
These and other initiatives give new hope to the many who are still suffering from this chronic condition.
Advances in treating gonorrhea, a common sexually transmitted infection that has become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, are also worthy of mention.
Wrapping up my list of disease-specific gains of 2017 is the renewed commitment made by global health ministers to eradicate tuberculosis by 2030.
The final two successes are reminders of how much work remains.
In August, the fast food giant McDonald’s unveiled a Global Vision for Antimicrobial Stewardship in Food Animals.
Although recognition of the food industry’s ethical responsibilities for public health is to be welcomed, the pledge also represents a cautionary note about how closely connected food and health really are.
Finally, rounding out my list was the historic Universal Health Coverage Forum held in Tokyo, where global leaders gathered to discuss how to improve health-care access.
The World Bank and the WHO note that half of the world’s population still cannot obtain essential health services.
I therefore count the December meeting as a “success” not for its achievements, but because it was a reminder to the international community that improving health-care access remains a long-term endeavor.
As the global health community resets its annual clock – and I begin cataloguing the big health stories of 2018 – we should take a moment to reflect on the 12 months recently ended.
Even in a mediocre year, the global health community saved millions of lives.
Imagine what we will achieve in an extraordinary year.
Bringing Gender Equality to Global Public Health
NEW YORK – Over the past few decades, the international community has tasked itself with achieving a wide range of social and environmental objectives, many of which are enshrined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for 2030.
We have advocated for many of these goals, as well as similar efforts that preceded the SDGs, because we believe that such collective projects are necessary to create the type of world we want for our children and grandchildren.
But we have also come to realize that far too many efforts to fulfill global commitments lack the meaningful reporting mechanisms needed to succeed.
If we are serious about translating lofty pronouncements into real progress for people and the planet, this will have to change.
Consider public health, an issue that affects everyone.
The global agenda in this area determines the norms and standards that shape how public and private actors promote health, prevent disease, and administer care.
It encompasses research initiatives and global public goods such as vaccines and emergency-preparedness programs for epidemic outbreaks.
And it brings people together to work toward providing universal health coverage and ensuring everyone’s right to health.
In the SDG framework, the separate issues of gender and health are intertwined, because gender itself is a major driver of health outcomes.
Gender can influence whether one smokes tobacco, exercises regularly, or has access to nutritious food.
And given that over 75% of the health workforce worldwide is female, it also often determines who will care for you when you are sick.
For decades, the global health community has paid lip service to the critical role of unequal power relations, particularly relating to gender, in determining health outcomes.
At this point, one might expect to see a high degree of gender equality in the health sector.
But a recent report by the advocacy and accountability group Global Health 50/50 shows otherwise.
In fact, the report, which reviewed 140 organizations working in the global health sector, makes for disturbing reading.
Many of these organizations are falling embarrassingly short on addressing gender disparities.
Half of the organizations’ strategies do not include a specific commitment to gender equality; and while a third do focus on the health of women and girls, they make no mention of gendered risks.
The situation is even worse for men and boys, who, regardless of country, can expect to live shorter, unhealthier lives than their female peers.
According to the Global Health 50/50 report, only a third of organizations take a gendered approach to the health needs of the whole population, and no organizations target men and boys specifically.
Moreover, only 43% of the organizations that were surveyed have specific measures in place to support women’s careers in public health, despite the overwhelmingly female composition of the health workforce.
It should come as no surprise that the majority of these organizations are run by men.
Across the full sample, 80% of board chairs and 69% of chief executives are male.
For us, one of the report’s more dismaying findings is that two-thirds of the organizations do not disaggregate data by sex.
Without data, transparency, and adequate reporting on gender disparities, there can be no progress toward gender equality.
Still, the report’s findings are not all negative.
The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, the Bangladesh-based organization BRAC, Save the Children International, and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria are among a dozen or so organizations that perform well across the board.
What they have in common are committed leaders who have taken proactive steps to ensure progress.
The successful organizations have all adopted clear policies and roadmaps for driving organizational change.
They have established systems of accountability, including measures to ensure that gender competence is included in job descriptions and staff performance evaluations.
And they have created flexible work environments, featuring parental leave and other family-oriented policies.
Looking ahead, we hope to see all global health organizations adopt concrete measures to address the shortcomings identified in the Global Health 50/50 report.
Failing that, we would recommend that next year’s report also rank the organizations in question, to make clear which of them are still falling behind.
Women once had to fight for the right to vote, and we are now fighting for paid parental leave and equal pay.
But we must go further, by also advocating for accountability and gender equality in the sphere of global public health.
Hope for Global Health in 2017
HONG KONG – Looking back on 2016, there may not seem to be much to celebrate.
In terms of global health alone, the year appeared to be one of unrelenting tragedy.
Beyond stories of hospitals in conflict zones being bombed, the Zika virus emerged as a growing threat.
There was also the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant microbes, or “superbugs,” the continued revival of yellow fever, and the reemergence of polio in Nigeria, which had previously been declared polio-free.
Hopes for a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine were dashed.
And in Europe, the incidence of alcohol-related deaths increased.
But, buried among all of the bad stories, there were some inspiring developments in global health in 2016.
The first took place in Tanzania and Mozambique, where African giant pouched rats, which had previously been trained by the Belgian NGO APOPO to detect landmines, were repurposed to help in the fight against tuberculosis (TB).
The rats undergo a thorough training process, in which they are introduced to various stimuli, shown how to interact with people, and taught to detect TB in samples of sputum (mucus that is coughed up from the lower airways).
The rats can detect TB with almost 100% accuracy, though they cannot distinguish between normal and drug-resistant strains.
A second positive development was the creation of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).
The emergence of infectious diseases (like Ebola, chikungunya, Zika, and, previously, SARS, swine flu, and MERS) typically highlights the inadequate capacity of public-health systems to build up defenses quickly.
CEPI aims to change this.
Its members – which come from international organizations, governments, industry, public and philanthropic R&D funders, academia, NGOs, and civil-society groups – will work to develop new vaccines that can prevent emerging infectious diseases from becoming epidemics.
The third positive development of 2016 was the progress made in combating malaria.
Deaths from malaria have been on the decline for years.
In Africa, which faces the world’s highest malaria mortality rates, the number of victims dropped from more than 800,000 per year in 2000 to roughly 400,000 last year.
Moreover, European drug regulators approved the first licensed human vaccine against malaria – RTS,S, or Mosquirix – in 2015, after nearly three decades of research and development.
It will not necessarily be smooth sailing from here: researchers have noticed that the vaccine’s effect weakens over time, and it is only 4% effective over a seven-year period.
But the vaccine remains a major breakthrough.
Reflecting its lifesaving potential, the World Health Organization has secured funding for an initial trial phase; beginning in 2018, the WHO will roll out RTS,S in pilot programs that would test its real-world efficacy in Sub-Saharan Africa.
There is more good news on the vaccine front: a herpes vaccine for shingles has been developed.
Shingles, a viral disease characterized by a painful skin rash with blisters, is caused by the reactivation of the chickenpox virus within a person’s body.
If the rash involves the eye, vision loss may occur.
Some people develop ongoing nerve pain, which can last for months or even years.
The new vaccine is significantly more effective than the one that is currently available, which reduces the risk of contracting shingles by only about 50%.
Dengue fever, too, is now vaccine-preventable.
Dengue, ranked by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the world’s most significant and fastest-growing mosquito-borne viral disease, causes nearly 50 million infections every year.
But, in 2016, the first – and, currently, the only – dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, was approved in 12 countries.
Dengvaxia has received endorsements from key medical societies, at the national and regional levels.
The recommendations are consistent with the WHO’s position paper recommending that countries with a high burden of disease consider the introduction of the vaccine as part of an integrated dengue-management program.
As if that were not enough, we now have an Ebola vaccine, too.
An experimental vaccine tested on humans has been shown to provide 100% protection against the disease.
Though no regulatory authority has approved it yet, it is viewed as so powerful that an emergency stockpile of 300,000 doses has been created for use in the event of another outbreak.
Diseases for which we do not have vaccines have also been beaten back.
For example, HIV infections and deaths have stabilized, despite rapid population growth in Africa.
This is a testament to the tremendous effort that has been made to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic, through prevention, education, and treatment programs.
To maintain progress against the epidemic, the global health community must sustain these efforts.
Furthermore, the Americas are now almost free of river blindness, a parasitic infection spread by black flies that causes itching and, in severe cases, vision loss.
Guatemala has been declared free of the disease, meaning that, in the Americas, only one remote area in the Amazon remains affected.
We are also one step closer to eliminating lymphatic filariasis, also known as elephantiasis.
Caused by the filarial worm, elephantiasis is a parasitic infection that can cause horrific swelling of the legs and scrotum.
This year, Cambodia, the Cook Islands, Niue, and Vanuatu received acknowledgement from the WHO for having eliminated lymphatic filariasis as a public-health problem.
Also on the brink of eradication is guinea worm, a nasty tropical parasite that spreads via contaminated water.
According to the Carter Center, one of the organizations leading the effort to eradicate guinea worm, there were around two dozen cases in the first ten months of 2016.
Guinea worm is now on a path to becoming the second human disease ever to be eradicated.
As we begin 2017, it is important to recognize the public-health victories that we have achieved.
However bad things may seem and however heartbreaking the hurdles are, there are plenty of reasons to remain hopeful – and to keep working for a better, healthier future.
Global Imbalances without Tears
CAMBRIDGE – Doctors have long known that it is not just how much you eat, but what you eat, that contributes to or diminishes your health.
Likewise, economists have long noted that for countries gorging on capital inflows, there is a big difference between debt instruments and equity-like investments, including both stocks and foreign direct investment.
So, with policymakers and pundits railing against sustained oversized trade imbalances, we need to recognize that the real problems are rooted in excessive concentrations of debt.
If G-20 governments stood back and asked themselves how to channel a much larger share of the imbalances into equity-like instruments, the global financial system that emerged just might be a lot more robust than the crisis-prone system that we have now.
Unfortunately, we are very far from the idealized world in which financial markets efficiently share risk.
Of the roughly $200 trillion in global financial assets today, almost three-quarters are in some kind of debt instrument, including bank loans, corporate bonds, and government securities.
The derivatives market certainly helps spread risk more widely than this superficial calculation implies, but the basic point stands.
Certainly, there are some good economic reasons why lenders have such an insatiable appetite for debt.
Imperfect information and difficulties in monitoring firms pose significant obstacles to idealized risk-sharing instruments.
But policy-induced distortions also play an enormous role.
Many countries’ tax systems hugely favor debt over equity.
The housing boom in the United States might never have reached the proportions that it did if homeowners had been unable to treat interest payments on home loans as a tax deduction.
Corporations are allowed to deduct interest payments on bonds, but stock dividends are effectively taxed at the both the corporate and the individual level.
Central banks and finance ministries are also complicit, since debt gets bailed out far more aggressively than equity does.
But, contrary to populist rhetoric, it is not just rich, well-connected bondholders who get bailed out. Many small savers place their savings in so-called money-market funds that pay a premium over ordinary federally insured deposits.
Shouldn’t they expect to face risk?
Yet a critical moment in the crisis came when, shortly after the mid-September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, a money-market fund “broke the buck” and couldn’t pay 100 cents on the dollar. Of course, it was bailed out along with all the other money-market funds.
I am not advocating a return to the early Middle Ages, when Church usury laws forbade interest on loans.
Back then, financial-market participants had to devise fantastic schemes and contortions to disguise interest payments.
Yet today the pendulum has arguably swung too far in the opposite direction.
Perhaps scholars who argue that Islamic financial systems’ prohibition on interest generates massive inefficiencies ought to be looking at these systems for positive ideas that Western policymakers might adopt.
Unfortunately, overcoming the deeply ingrained debt bias in rich-world financial systems will not be easy.
In the US, for example, no politician is anxious to say that home-mortgage deductions should be eliminated, or that dividend payments should be tax-free.
Likewise, developing countries should accelerate the pace of economic reform, and equity markets in too many emerging economies are like the Wild West, with unclear rules and lax enforcement.
Worse still, even as the G-20 talks about finding a “fix” for global imbalances, some of the policy changes that its members have adopted are arguably exacerbating them.
For example, we now have a super-size International Monetary Fund, whose lending capacity has been tripled, to roughly $750 billion.
Europe has similarly expanded its regional bailout facility.
These funds may prove to be an effective short-term salve, but, over the long run, they will likely fuel moral-hazard problems, and potentially plant the seeds of deeper crises in the future.
A better approach would be to create a mechanism for orchestrating orderly sovereign default, both to minimize damage when crises do occur, and to discourage lenders from assuming that taxpayers’ money will solve all major problems.
The IMF proposed exactly such a mechanism in 2001, and a similar idea has been discussed more recently for the eurozone.
Unfortunately, however, ideas for debt-restructuring mechanisms remain just that: purely theoretical constructs.
In the meantime, the IMF and the G-20 can help by finding better ways to assess the vulnerability of each country’s financial structure – no easy task, given governments’ immense cleverness when it comes to cooking their books.
Policymakers can also help find ways to reduce barriers to the development of stock markets, and to advance ideas for new kinds of state-contingent bonds, such as the GDP-linked bonds that Yale’s Robert Shiller has proposed. (Shiller bonds, in theory, pay more when a country’s economy is growing and less when it is in recession.)
Of course, even if the composition of international capital flows can be changed, there are still many good reasons to try to reduce global imbalances.
An asset diet rich in equities and direct investment and low in debt cannot substitute for other elements of fiscal and financial health.
But our current unwholesome asset diet is an important component of risk, one that has received far too little attention in the policy debate.
The Global Impact of a Chinese Recession
CAMBRIDGE – When China finally has its inevitable growth recession – which will almost surely be amplified by a financial crisis, given the economy’s massive leverage – how will the rest of world be affected?
With US President Donald Trump’s trade war hitting China just as growth was already slowing, this is no idle question.
Typical estimates, for example those embodied in the International Monetary Fund’s assessments of country risk, suggest that an economic slowdown in China will hurt everyone.
But the acute pain, according to the IMF, will be more regionally concentrated and confined than would be the case for a deep recession in the United States.
Unfortunately, this might be wishful thinking.
First, the effect on international capital markets could be vastly greater than Chinese capital market linkages would suggest.
However jittery global investors may be about prospects for profit growth, a hit to Chinese growth would make things a lot worse.
Although it is true that the US is still by far the biggest importer of final consumption goods (a large share of Chinese manufacturing imports are intermediate goods that end up being embodied in exports to the US and Europe), foreign firms nonetheless still enjoy huge profits on sales in China.
Investors today are also concerned about rising interest rates, which not only put a damper on consumption and investment, but also reduce the market value of companies (particularly tech firms) whose valuations depend heavily on profit growth far in the future.
A Chinese recession could again make the situation worse.
I appreciate the usual Keynesian thinking that if any economy anywhere slows, this lowers world aggregate demand, and therefore puts downward pressure on global interest rates.
But modern thinking is more nuanced.
High Asian saving rates over the past two decades have been a significant factor in the low overall level of real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates in both the United States and Europe, thanks to the fact that underdeveloped Asian capital markets simply cannot constructively absorb the surplus savings.
Former US Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke famously characterized this much-studied phenomenon as a key component of the “global savings glut.”
Thus, instead of leading to lower global real interest rates, a Chinese slowdown that spreads across Asia could paradoxically lead to higher interest rates elsewhere – especially if a second Asian financial crisis leads to a sharp draw-down of central bank reserves.
Thus, for global capital markets, a Chinese recession could easily prove to be a double whammy.
As bad as a slowdown in exports to China would be for many countries, a significant rise in global interest rates would be much worse.
Eurozone leaders, particularly German Chancellor Angela Merkel, get less credit than they deserve for holding together the politically and economically fragile single currency against steep economic and political odds.
But their task would have been well-nigh impossible but for the ultra-low global interest rates that have allowed politically paralyzed eurozone officials to skirt needed debt write-downs and restructurings in the periphery.
When the advanced countries had their financial crisis a decade ago, emerging markets recovered relatively quickly, thanks to low debt levels and strong commodity prices.
Today, however, debt levels have risen significantly, and a sharp rise in global real interest rates would almost certainly extend today’s brewing crises beyond the handful of countries (including Argentina and Turkey) that have already been hit.
Nor is the US immune.
For the moment, the US can finance its trillion-dollar deficits at relatively low cost.
But the relatively short-term duration of its borrowing – under four years if one integrates the Treasury and Federal Reserve balance sheets – means that a rise in interest rates would soon cause debt service to crowd out needed expenditures in other areas.
At the same time, Trump’s trade war also threatens to undermine the US economy’s dynamism.
Its somewhat arbitrary and politically driven nature makes it at least as harmful to US growth as the regulations Trump has so proudly eliminated.
Those who assumed that Trump’s stance on trade was mostly campaign bluster should be worried.
The good news is that trade negotiations often seem intractable until the eleventh hour.
The US and China could reach an agreement before Trump’s punitive tariffs go into effect on January 1.
Such an agreement, one hopes, would reflect a maturing of China’s attitude toward intellectual property rights – akin to what occurred in the US during the late nineteenth century. (In America’s high growth years, US entrepreneurs often thought little of pilfering patented inventions from the United Kingdom.)
A recession in China, amplified by a financial crisis, would constitute the third leg of the debt supercycle that began in the US in 2008 and moved to Europe in 2010.
Up to this point, the Chinese authorities have done a remarkable job in postponing the inevitable slowdown.
Unfortunately, when the downturn arrives, the world is likely to discover that China’s economy matters even more than most people thought.
The State of Global Poverty
WASHINGTON, DC – The economic geography of the world is changing.
The eurozone faces the specter of another round of stagnation; Japan has slipped into recession; and the United States, despite relatively strong performance in the latter part of 2014, has raised concerns worldwide with its exit from quantitative easing.
Meanwhile, emerging economies have continued to perform well.
India and Indonesia are growing at more than 5% per year; Malaysia at 6%; and China by more than 7%.
The scale of the global change can be seen when purchasing power parity (PPP) – a measure of the total amount of goods and services that a dollar can buy in each country – is taken into account.
According to the figures for 2011, released last year, India is now the world’s third largest economy in terms of PPP-adjusted GDP, ahead of Germany and Japan.
The data also revealed that China would overtake the US as the world’s largest economy in PPP terms sometime in 2014 – a shift that, according to our estimates, occurred on October 10th.
Despite this progress, a large proportion of people in developing countries remain desperately poor.
Globally, the poverty line is defined as a daily income of $1.25, adjusted for PPP – a line that many criticize as shockingly low.
But what is truly shocking is that nearly one billion people – including more than 80% of the populations of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Liberia, and Burundi – live below it.
One reason global poverty has been so intractable is that it remains largely out of sight for those who are not living it, safely somebody else’s problem.
The fact that most participants in discussions about global poverty – the readers of this commentary included – know few, if any, people who live below the poverty line is an indication of the extent of the world’s economic segregation.
If poverty were communicable, its incidence would be far lower by now.
Fortunately, a chorus of voices, not just from civil-society groups, but also from international organizations, has given rise to a global movement to end poverty.
There is now a growing consensus that global poverty is not just a problem of the poor.
Though moral outrage is important, it is not enough when it comes to crafting policy.
Policymakers need data and, equally important, the ability to analyze it.
The first task is to distinguish between what is feasible and what is not.
For example, some have proposed including the provision of employment for all adults in the Millennium Development Goals’ successor framework, which is to be unveiled this year.
This is an impossible target.
All economies of any reasonable size will have some unemployment.
In fact, a limited amount of unemployment can help to promote development.
To declare “employment” a right is to divest the word “right” of its meaning.
Next, there must be recognition that economies are complex and interconnected.
Consider, for example, a government policy in which subsidies, funded with newly printed money, are handed out to residents of 1,000 villages.
This will not necessarily be a boon for the economy as a whole.
Injecting money might improve the living standards in the villages receiving the funds, but doing so may well drive up the cost of food throughout the country, causing residents of non-subsidized villages to fall into poverty.
The macroeconomic impact of micro-interventions is an important reason why poverty has persisted, despite well-meaning interventions to combat it.
Another reason poverty endures is persistent – and, in many places, widening – inequality.
The current level of global inequality is unconscionable.
In 2013, the World Bank, where I am Chief Economist, helped bring the term “shared prosperity” into everyday discourse by declaring, for the first time, that every society should make progress toward this goal its mission.
To be sure, there will always be a certain amount of inequality in the world; in fact, as with unemployment, a limited amount is desirable as a driver of competition and growth.
But the deep and pervasive inequality that exists today can only be condemned.
According to some back-of-the-envelope calculations, the wealth of the world’s 50 richest people totals $1.5 trillion, equivalent to 175% of Indonesia’s GDP, or a little more than Japan’s foreign-exchange reserves.
If one assumes that this wealth yields 8% per year, the annual income of the world’s 50 wealthiest people is close to the total income of the poorest one billion – in other words, those living below the poverty line.
This is a collective failure.
As 2015 begins, we must consider policies and interventions to curb such extreme inequality.
We must do this not only out of a sense of justice, but also because, in a world afflicted with such extreme disparities, its poorest residents lose their voice, even when they have the right to vote.
Extreme inequality is, ultimately, an assault on democracy.
Who Should Lead International Institutions?
OXFORD – The United Nations is seeking a new secretary-general. The World Bank presidency is up for grabs.
The World Health Organization needs a new head.
The same goes for several other international organizations. At a time when conflicts of interest among the United States and its allies, together with the rise of China and Russia, are undermining global cooperation, the question of who fills these vacancies could not be more important.
In the past, the process of selecting the right candidate has reflected rivalries among countries and popularity contests played out among governments, NGOs, and the media.
This was clearly never the best approach. But, with a hegemonic United States willing and able to hold international institutions together, cooperation remained viable.
Today, the unpredictable statements of US presidential candidate Donald Trump and the more isolationist vision that he is encouraging among his supporters has the rest of the world nervous about the changing nature of America’s role in the world.
And America’s allies in Europe are not exactly at their most stable, owing to a combination of deep-rooted economic challenges, the United Kingdom’s looming exit from the European Union, and surging support for populist political forces in many countries.
Moreover, the US and its allies are not only unwilling to underpin global cooperation, they lack the capacity even to try.
The International Monetary Fund’s recent World Economic Outlook reports that the US and its allies will account for just 39% of global output in 2020, down sharply from 64% today, with the US share falling from 22% to 15%.
For the international institutions, this means that communication, compromise, and consensus are more important than ever – and not just among countries.
Given strong anti-establishment and even nationalist sentiment in many countries, international institutions must also be more open with – and responsive to – the global public that they are supposed to serve.
All of this demands a more meritocratic and unbiased approach to filling the top positions at the international institutions.
To assess the candidates fairly and effectively, five key criteria should be used.
First, candidates should have a proven ability not just to define a mission, but also to take on the more challenging task of mobilizing a broad coalition of stakeholders to achieve it.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, for example, had little trouble identifying critical issues, from specific humanitarian crises in countries like Haiti, Myanmar, and Pakistan to broader challenges like climate change and global poverty. But his success in spurring countries to work together to address those issues is dubious.
Second, leaders must be able to persuade countries to fund their organizations.
Former African Development Bank President Donald P. Kaberuka convinced countries to double their contributions during his tenure; during the same cycle, the World Bank’s resources were increased by just one-third.
But it is not just a matter of getting more money.
Organizations need to focus on expanding their core resources, which are not tied to any specific task, rather than drawing more discretionary or earmarked resources.
Otherwise, they risk becoming hired hands for a few pet projects, rather than critical platforms for broad cooperation.
Unfortunately, in recent years, discretionary funding has largely taken over, and now accounts for more than 90% of resources in several agencies.
The International Organization for Migration, the importance of which has been underscored by the ongoing refugee crisis, relies entirely on discretionary funding.
To change this, international organizations need leaders who are convincing salespeople, which means that they must be widely perceived as genuine and trustworthy.
The third criterion for effective leadership of an international institution is strong, results-oriented management.
Successful candidates should already have experience leading an organization that performed well, achieving the results they set out to achieve.
There should be evidence that the candidate can translate a vision into a plan, with clear benchmarks against which progress can be measured.
The current slates of candidates is wanting in this regard.
This can have far-reaching consequences.
World Bank President Jim Yong Kim has faced substantial criticism for his handling of his flagship initiative: an internal restructuring.
That process has dragged on for four years, and many staff members claim that it is undermining the efficiency of lending operations.
While it is difficult to assess these claims reliably, a leaked internal survey of the organization’s employees indicates, at the very least, that the management culture needs improvement.
This is closely related to the fourth criterion: hiring (and retaining) the right staff.
No leader can do everything alone, so choosing a high-quality team is crucial.
If those working at the organization are unhappy, recruiting the most talented and motivated people will be nearly impossible.
Beyond creating an open, challenging, and supportive culture – reflected in internal surveys that are shared publicly (not leaked) – the leaders of international organizations must resist pressure from member countries to hire particular senior officials, who are not necessarily the highest-performing candidates.
Moreover, they must be willing and able to identify and remove inherited senior managers who are not up to standard.
The key words must be meritocracy and morale.
The final criterion for effective leadership of an international organization concerns accountability.
In the last couple of decades, heads of the IMF, the World Bank, and the UNHCR Refugee Agency have left office under a cloud of suspicion.
Some leaders have lately established far stricter codes of conduct; it is up to the new ones to ensure that they are being enforced.
Welcoming independent evaluation – and disclosing the results – is essential.
The world needs strong international institutions more than ever.
And strong institutions need outstanding leaders who can build consensus among increasingly bad-tempered governments, while attracting sufficient resources and mobilizing talented people to get the job done. This is no time to compromise for short-term political expediency.
Grappling With Globalization 4.0
GENEVA – After World War II, the international community came together to build a shared future.
Now, it must do so again.
Owing to the slow and uneven recovery in the decade since the global financial crisis, a substantial part of society has become disaffected and embittered, not only with politics and politicians, but also with globalization and the entire economic system it underpins.
In an era of widespread insecurity and frustration, populism has become increasingly attractive as an alternative to the status quo.
But populist discourse elides – and often confounds – the substantive distinctions between two concepts: globalization and globalism.
Globalization is a phenomenon driven by technology and the movement of ideas, people, and goods.
Globalism is an ideology that prioritizes the neoliberal global order over national interests.
Nobody can deny that we are living in a globalized world.
But whether all of our policies should be “globalist” is highly debatable.
After all, this moment of crisis has raised important questions about our global-governance architecture.
With more and more voters demanding to “take back control” from “global forces,” the challenge is to restore sovereignty in a world that requires cooperation.
Rather than closing off economies through protectionism and nationalist politics, we must forge a new social compact between citizens and their leaders, so that everyone feels secure enough at home to remain open to the world at large.
Failing that, the ongoing disintegration of our social fabric could ultimately lead to the collapse of democracy.
Moreover, the challenges associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) are coinciding with the rapid emergence of ecological constraints, the advent of an increasingly multipolar international order, and rising inequality.
These integrated developments are ushering in a new era of globalization.
Whether it will improve the human condition will depend on whether corporate, local, national, and international governance can adapt in time.
Meanwhile, a new framework for global public-private cooperation has been taking shape.
Public-private cooperation is about harnessing the private sector and open markets to drive economic growth for the public good, with environmental sustainability and social inclusiveness always in mind.
But to determine the public good, we first must identify the root causes of inequality.
For example, while open markets and increased competition certainly produce winners and losers in the international arena, they may be having an even more pronounced effect on inequality at the national level.
Moreover, the growing divide between the precariat and the privileged is being reinforced by 4IR business models, which often derive rents from owning capital or intellectual property.
Closing that divide requires us to recognize that we are living in a new type of innovation-driven economy, and that new global norms, standards, policies, and conventions are needed to safeguard the public trust.
The new economy has already disrupted and recombined countless industries, and dislocated millions of workers.
It is dematerializing production, by increasing the knowledge intensity of value creation.
It is heightening competition within domestic product, capital, and labor markets, as well as among countries adopting different trade and investment strategies.
And it is fueling distrust, particularly of technology companies and their stewardship of our data.
The unprecedented pace of technological change means that our systems of health, transportation, communication, production, distribution, and energy – just to name a few – will be completely transformed.
Managing that change will require not just new frameworks for national and multinational cooperation, but also a new model of education, complete with targeted programs for teaching workers new skills.
With advances in robotics and artificial intelligence in the context of aging societies, we will have to move from a narrative of production and consumption toward one of sharing and caring.
Globalization 4.0 has only just begun, but we are already vastly underprepared for it.
Clinging to an outdated mindset and tinkering with our existing processes and institutions will not do.
Rather, we need to redesign them from the ground up, so that we can capitalize on the new opportunities that await us, while avoiding the kind of disruptions that we are witnessing today.
As we develop a new approach to the new economy, we must remember that we are not playing a zero-sum game.
This is not a matter of free trade or protectionism, technology or jobs, immigration or protecting citizens, and growth or equality.
Those are all false dichotomies, which we can avoid by developing policies that favor “and” over “or,” allowing all sets of interests to be pursued in parallel.
To be sure, pessimists will argue that political conditions are standing in the way of a productive global dialogue about Globalization 4.0 and the new economy.
But realists will use the current moment to explore the gaps in the present system, and to identify the requirements for a future approach.
And optimists will hold out hope that future-oriented stakeholders will create a community of shared interest and, ultimately, shared purpose.
The changes that are underway today are not isolated to a particular country, industry, or issue.
They are universal, and thus require a global response.
Failing to adopt a new cooperative approach would be a tragedy for humankind.
To draft a blueprint for a shared global-governance architecture, we must avoid becoming mired in the current moment of crisis management.
Specifically, this task will require two things of the international community: wider engagement and heightened imagination.
The engagement of all stakeholders in sustained dialogue will be crucial, as will the imagination to think systemically, and beyond one’s own short-term institutional and national considerations.
These will be the two organizing principles of the World Economic Forum’s upcoming Annual Meeting in Davos-Klosters, which will convene under the theme of “Globalization 4.0: Shaping a New Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution”.
Ready or not, a new world is upon us.
Globalization After the Crisis
WASHINGTON, DC – The world economy has just been through a severe recession marked by financial turmoil, large-scale destruction of wealth, and declines in industrial production and global trade. According to the International Labor Organization, continued labor-market deterioration in 2009 may lead to an estimated increase in global unemployment of 39-61 million workers relative to 2007.
By the end of this year, the worldwide ranks of the unemployed may range from 219-241 million – the highest number on record.
Meanwhile, global growth in real wages, which slowed dramatically in 2008, is expected to have dropped even further in 2009, despite signs of a possible economic recovery.
In a sample of 53 countries for which data are available, median growth in real average wages had declined from 4.3% in 2007 to 1.4% in 2008.
The World Bank warns that 89 million more people may be trapped in poverty in the wake of the crisis, adding to the 1.4 billion people estimated in 2005 to be living below the international poverty line of $1.25 a day.
In this climate, globalization has come under heavy criticism, including from leaders of developing countries that could strongly benefit from it.
President Yoweri Museveni, who is widely credited for integrating Uganda into world markets, has said that globalization is “the same old order with new means of control, new means of oppression, new means of marginalization” by rich countries seeking to secure access to developing country markets.
Yet the alternative to global integration holds little attraction.
Indeed, while closing an economy may insulate it from shocks, it can also result in stagnation and even severe homegrown crises. Current examples include Myanmar and North Korea; before their economic liberalization China, Vietnam, and India were in the same boat.
To ensure a durable exit from the crisis, and to build foundations for sustained and broad-based growth in a globalized world, developing countries in 2010 and beyond must draw the right lessons from history.
In the current crisis, China, India, and certain other emerging-market countries are coping fairly well.
These countries all had strong external balance sheets and ample room for fiscal maneuver before the crisis, which allowed them to apply countercyclical policies to combat external shocks.
They have also nurtured industries in line with their comparative advantage, which has helped them weather the storm.
Indeed, comparative advantage – determined by the relative abundance of labor, natural resources, and capital endowments – is the foundation for competitiveness, which in turn underpins dynamic growth and strong fiscal and external positions.
By contrast, if a country attempts to defy its comparative advantage, such as by adopting an import-substitution strategy to pursue the development of capital-intensive or high-tech industries in a capital-scarce economy, the government may resort to distortional subsidies and protections that dampen economic performance.
In turn, this risks weakening both the government’s fiscal position and the economy’s external account.
Without the ability to take timely countercyclical measures, such countries fare poorly when crises hit.
To pursue its comparative advantage and prosper in a globalized world, a country needs a price system that reflects the relative abundance of its factor endowments.
Firms in such a context will have incentives to enter industries that can use their relatively abundant labor to replace relatively scarce capital, or vice versa, thereby reducing costs and enhancing competitiveness.
Examples include the development of garments in Bangladesh, software outsourcing in India, and light manufacturing in China.
But such a relative price system is feasible only in a market economy.
This is why China – which appears to be faring well in the crisis, meeting its 8% growth target in 2009 – became an economic powerhouse only after instituting market-oriented reforms in the 1980s.
Indeed, all 13 economies with an average annual growth rate of 7% or more for 25 years or longer, identified in the Growth Commission Report led by Nobel laureate Michael Spence, are market economies.
Pursuing its comparative advantage strengthens a country’s resilience to crisis and allows for the rapid accumulation of human and physical capital.
Developing countries with such characteristics are able to turn factor endowments from relatively labor- or resource- abundant to relatively capital-abundant in the span of a generation.
In today’s competitive global marketplace, countries need to upgrade and diversify their industries continuously according to their changing endowments.
A pioneering firm’s success or failure in upgrading and/or diversifying will influence whether other firms follow or not.
Government compensation for such pioneering firms can speed the process.
Industrial progress also requires coordination of related investments among firms.
In Ecuador, a country that is now a successful exporter of cut flowers, farmers would not grow flowers decades ago because there was no modern cooling facility near the airport, and private firms would not invest in such facilities without a supply of flowers for export.
In such chicken-and-egg situations, in which the market alone fails to overcome externalities and essential investments go lacking, the government can play a vital facilitating role.
This may be one of the reasons why the Growth Commission Report also found that successful economies all have committed, credible, and capable governments.
The world is now so far down the path of integration that turning back is no longer a viable option.
We must internalize lessons from the past and focus on establishing well-functioning markets that enable developing countries fully to tap their economies’ comparative advantage.
As part of this process, a facilitating role for the state is desirable in developing and developed economies alike, although the appropriate role may be different depending on a country’s stage of development.
Ultimately, in today’s complex and interlinked world, even the most competitive economies need a helping hand as they climb the global ladder.
Globalization and Anti-Americanism
Anti-American sentiments are rising around the world.
American Democrats say that President Bush's policies have squandered America's attractiveness. Republicans reply that America is bound to be resented because of its size and its association with globalization.
Anti-Americanism, they say, will persist because some people see America as a cultural threat.
I believe that such views lack historical perspective.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, globalization is not homogenizing and Americanizing the cultures of the world.
Although the United States is at the forefront of the current information revolution, which is creating many similarities in social and cultural habits (such as television viewing or Internet use) that are attributed to Americanization, correlation is not causation.
To see why, imagine a country that introduced computers and communications at a rapid rate in a world in which America did not exist.
You would still expect major social and cultural changes from such modernization.
Of course, because the US exists and is at the forefront of the information revolution, there is a degree of Americanization, but that is likely to diminish over the course of the twenty-first century as technology spreads and local cultures modernize in their own ways.
Historical proof that globalization does not necessarily mean homogenization can be seen in Japan, a country that deliberately isolated itself from earlier waves of globalization.
In the middle of the nineteenth century, Japan became the first Asian country to embrace globalization, and to borrow successfully from the world without losing its uniqueness.
During the Meiji Restoration, Japan searched broadly for tools and innovations that would allow it to become a major power rather than a victim of Western imperialism.
It sent young people to the West for education.
Its delegations scoured the world for ideas in science, technology, and industry.
In the political realm, Meiji reformers were well aware of Anglo-American ideas and institutions, but deliberately turned to German models because they were deemed more suitable to a country with an emperor.
The lesson that Japan teaches the rest of the world is not simply that an Asian country can compete, but that after a century and a half of globalization, it is possible to adapt while preserving a unique culture.
More fundamentally, the image of a homogenizing America reflects a mistakenly static view of culture.
Efforts to portray local cultures as unchanging often reflect reactionary political strategies rather than descriptions of reality.
As the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa has put it, those who argue in favor of cultural identity and against globalization, betray a stagnant attitude towards culture that is not borne out by historical fact.
Do we know of any cultures that have remained unchanged through time?
To find any of them one has to travel to the small, primitive, magico-religious communities made up of people… who due to their primitive condition, become progressively more vulnerable to exploitation and extermination.
Vibrant cultures are constantly changing and borrowing from other cultures - and that borrowing is not always from the US.
For example, many more countries turned to Canada than to America as an example for framing constitutions in the aftermath of the Cold War.
Globalization is also a two-edged sword.
In some areas, there is not only a backlash against American cultural imports, but an effort to change American culture itself.
Capital punishment may now be supported by a majority of Americans, but the death penalty is regarded as an egregious violation of human rights across Europe - indeed, across much of the world.
American environmental attitudes toward climate change or genetic modification of food bring similar criticism.
More subtly, America's openness to immigration both enriches and changes American culture.
Finally, globalization and the information revolution may reinforce rather than reduce cultural diversity.
Some French commentators express fear that in a world of Internet global marketing, there will no longer be room for a culture that cherishes hundreds of different types of cheese.
But on the contrary, the Internet allows dispersed customers to come together in a way that encourages niche markets, including hundreds of Web sites dedicated only to cheese.
The Internet also allows people to establish a more diverse set of political communities.
The use of the Welsh language in Britain and Gaelic in Ireland is greater today than fifty years ago.
Britain, Belgium, and Spain, among others in Europe, have devolved more power to local regions.
The global information age may strengthen rather than weaken local cultures.
Economic and social globalization does produce superficial similarities in T-shirt logos and soft drink brands, but an underlying cultural diversity will remain.
American culture is now prominent, and it contributes to America's attractiveness - its "soft power" - in many, but not all, areas.
At the same time, immigrants, ideas, and events outside America's borders are changing American culture within the borders of the US.
As globalization spreads technical capabilities, and information technology allows broader participation in global communications, American economic and cultural preponderance may diminish.
A little less dominance may mean a little less anxiety about Americanization, fewer complaints about American arrogance, and less intensity in the anti-American backlash.
The US may have less control in the future, but it may find itself living in a world somewhat more congenial to its basic values of democracy, free markets, individual liberties, and human rights.
The Cacophony of the World
PARIS – In his masterpiece Diplomacy, Henry Kissinger describes, probably too idyllically, the international balance-of-power system that, following the Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815, produced what came to be called the “Concert of Europe.”
As Kissinger describes it, after the Napoleonic Wars, “There was not only a physical equilibrium, but a moral one.
Power and justice were in substantial harmony.”
Of course, the concert ended in cacophony with the outbreak of World War I in the summer of 1914.
Today, after the brutality of the first half of the twentieth century, the temporary bipolarity of the Cold War, and America’s brief post-1989 hyperpower status, the world is once again searching for a new international order.
Can something like the Concert of Europe be globalized?
Unfortunately, global cacophony seems more probable.
One obvious reason is the absence of a recognized and accepted international referee.
The United States, which best embodies ultimate power, is less willing – and less able – to exercise it.
And the United Nations, which best embodies the principles of international order, is as divided and impotent as ever.
But, beyond the absence of a referee, another issue looms: the wave of globalization that followed the end of the Cold War has, paradoxically, accelerated fragmentation, affecting democratic and non-democratic countries alike.
From the collapse of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia’s violent self-destruction, and Czechoslovakia’s peaceful divorce to today’s centrifugal pressures in Europe, the West, and the major emerging countries, fragmentation has been fundamental to international relations in recent decades.
The information revolution has created a more global, interdependent, and transparent world than ever.
But this has led, in turn, to an anxious, balkanizing quest for identity.
This effort to recover uniqueness is largely the cause of the international system’s growing fragmentation.
In the Concert of Europe, the number of actors was limited, and they were mostly states, whether national or imperial.
Essential values were widely shared, and most actors favored protecting the existing order.
In today’s world, by contrast, the nature of the actors involved is no longer so clear.
Transnational forces, states, and non-state actors are all involved, and their goals are complex and sometimes contradictory, with no universal commitment to preserving the status quo.
The US may be intent on creating a transatlantic trade-and-investment pact with Europe, which would make a political statement to the world that the West writ large constitutes the universal normative reference point.
But does such a West exist?
In our era of fragmentation, there is a more powerful and dynamic American West, a globally more problematic European West (itself fragmented between a prosperous north and an economically lagging south), and even a British West and, in Japan, an Asian West.
The concept of the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) may have been an astute branding tool.
But, aside from its members’ high growth rates, has it had any real significance?
Indeed, China is clearly in a category of its own, as a source of perceived (or real) risk to its regional environment.
If the BRICs’ growth slows (as has begun to happen), the concept’s artificiality will become widely apparent.
What unites emerging powers today is more their denial of international responsibilities than their joint diplomatic efforts.
Fragmentation also affects societies internally.
Deep partisan divisions – whether over the role of government or social/cultural issues – are leading to near-paralysis in democratic societies like the US.
In non-democratic societies, they can lead to revolution and violent power struggles.
This has been the case in much of the Arab world since late 2010.
Even power itself is more fragmented than ever.
Indeed, Moises Naim proclaims its demise in his latest book, The End of Power: From Boardrooms to Battlefields and Churches to States, Why Being in Charge Isn’t What It Used To Be.
While Naim’s conclusion may be premature, he is right about one thing: “Power no longer buys as much as it did in the past.”
It is “easier to get, harder to use – and easier to lose.”
Some analysts maintain, reassuringly, that rapprochement between Asia and the West is possible, given symbiosis between Western democracy and authoritarian Confucianism.
This is Kishore Mahbubani’s argument in his book The Great Convergence.
But the harmony stemming from the encounter between different cultures and systems is nowhere near – and will not be as long as the rule of law has not taken hold in the emerging world and a culture of modesty has not made headway within the plural West.
The cacophony of the world has replaced the concert of Europe.
And this may very well be the case for the foreseeable future.
Global Solutions for Globalization’s Problems
OXFORD – The last few decades of globalization and innovation have resulted in the most rapid progress that the world has ever known.
Poverty has been reduced.
Life expectancy has increased.
Wealth has been created at a scale that our ancestors could not have imagined.
But the news is not all good.
In fact, the achievements brought about by globalization are now under threat.
The world has simultaneously benefited from globalization and failed to manage the inherent complications resulting from the increased integration of our societies, our economies, and the infrastructure of modern life.
As a result, we have become dangerously exposed to systemic risks that transcend borders.
These threats spill across national boundaries and cross the traditional divides between industries and organizations.
An integrated financial system propagates economic crises.
International air travel spreads pandemics.
Interconnected computers provide rich hunting grounds for cybercriminals.
Middle Eastern jihadis use the Internet to recruit young Europeans.
Living standards rise – and greenhouse-gas emissions follow, accelerating climate change.
As a byproduct of globalization, crises that once burned locally and then quickly flamed out now risk sparking international conflagrations.
A pandemic, flood, or cyber attack in the City of London or Wall Street could send the entire world into a financial tailspin.
If the progress that globalization has delivered is to be sustained, countries must accept shared responsibility for managing the risks that it has engendered.
National governments – whether powerful, like the United States and China, or weak, like Iraq and Liberia – are unable to address these cascading and complex challenges on their own.
Only a small fraction of the risks arising from globalization require a truly global response.
But, by definition, these risks transcend the nation-state; thus, coordinated action is required to address them effectively.
The nature of the response needs to be tailored to the threat.
In the case of pandemics, the key is to support countries where outbreaks occur and help those most at risk of infection.
Widespread dangers, such as climate change or a new financial crisis, can require the cooperation of dozens of countries and a broad range of institutions.
In nearly every case, an international effort is needed.
An important characteristic of the risks of a globalized world is that they often become more serious over time.
As a result, the speed at which they are identified, along with the effectiveness of the response, can determine whether an isolated event becomes a global threat.
One need only look at the rise of the Islamic State, the outbreak of Ebola, the fight against climate change, or the financial contagion of 2008 to see what happens when a danger remains unidentified for too long or a coordinated response is missing or mismanaged.
And yet, just as the need for robust regional and international institutions is at its greatest, support for them is waning.
A growing number of citizens in Europe, North America, and the Middle East blame globalization for unemployment, rising inequality, pandemics, and terrorism.
Because of these risks, they regard increased integration, openness, and innovation as more of a threat than an opportunity.
This creates a vicious circle.
The concerns of the electorate are reflected in rapidly growing support for political parties that advocate increased protectionism, reductions in immigration, and greater national control over the marketplace.
As a result, governments across Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania are becoming more parochial in their concerns, starving international agencies and regional organizations of the funding, credibility, and leadership capabilities needed to mount a proper response to the challenges of globalization.
In the short term, countries may be able to duck their global responsibilities, but the threat posed by events beyond their borders cannot be kept at bay forever.
Unaddressed, the endemic dangers of a globalized world will continue to grow.
In confronting dangers such as the Islamic State, Ebola, financial crisis, climate change, or rising inequality, short-term political expediency must be overcome – or the entire world will come to regret it.
The Globalization Backlash Paradox
NEW DELHI – Most economists wax eloquent about the benefits of “real” global integration – that is, virtually uninhibited cross-border flows of goods, labor, and technology.
They are less certain when it comes to global financial integration, especially short-term flows of so-called hot money.
Yet today’s anti-globalization backlash is focused largely on real integration – and almost entirely spares its financial counterpart.
The backlash against real integration has, most recently, spurred US President Donald Trump’s administration to resort to unilateral trade protectionism, targeting China in particular.
In both the United States and Europe, barriers against migration are being raised.
Many governments are moving to impose new taxes on technology companies deemed to be too large or influential.
In this context, the absence of even a whiff of protest against financial integration is strange.
After all, financial flows have regularly wreaked havoc on rich and poor economies alike over the last 40 years.
And that damage is no secret: institutions like the International Monetary Fund have highlighted it, adding caveats to their previously unfettered support for financial openness.
The lack of resistance to financial integration may reflect the salience of the problem – or, perhaps more accurately, the narrative.
When it comes to real global integration, it is easy to identify perpetrators and victims; with financial integration, it is not.
Consider free trade. While it is beneficial overall, its adverse distributional effects are undeniable, and it is easy to say who gets hurt (for example, advanced-country workers in lower-value-added industries like steel) and who is doing the damage (developing countries that can produce and export the relevant good more cheaply).
The losers may be a minority, but they can band together to amplify their voice and maximize their bargaining power, especially if they are geographically concentrated.
With a clear target, their outrage acquires force and legitimacy.
Likewise, migration brings both major gains and, in the eyes of many, significant losses.
Apparent losers may include domestic workers who are (or believe they are) affected by competition from migrants, or citizens who feel that their way of life or even identity is being threatened.
It does not matter whether these claims are empirically true; they fit into a clear and compelling narrative, in which immigrants are portrayed as villains.
Such a narrative, as we have seen, is a very effective mobilization tool in the hands of cynical politicians.
Of course, financial crises – such as those in Latin America in the early 1980s, in East Asia in the late 1990s, in Eastern Europe in the late 2000s, and in Europe in the 2010s – also have clear victims: those who lose their jobs, houses, or retirement savings.
But it is not nearly as easy to apportion blame.
In the past – going back to the Middle Ages, in fact – the finger has often been pointed at banks.
But the sources of today’s “hot money” flows are not readily identifiable.
Hedge funds, mutual funds, asset-management companies, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds operate from all across the globe, in legitimate jurisdictions and in what W. Somerset Maugham once described as “sunny places for shady people.”
Even if the lenders could be readily identified, they could not be assigned all of the blame.
Financial transactions always involve borrowers as well, and, unlike laid-off steel workers, defaulting borrowers (individuals or countries) are rarely innocent victims.
In many cases, large borrowers have obtained their loans by deceiving the lenders or using political connections, as former Indonesian President Suharto’s cronies famously did.
While salient narratives featuring specific and readily identifiable villains make real integration – despite its tangible overall benefits – difficult to sustain, the absence of comparable narratives is allowing financial integration to continue unabated.
This places the world on track for a lot less of the good kind of integration, and more of the questionable kind.
Altering this trajectory calls for two types of response.
To support real integration, policymakers must create ambitious – even radically so – social safety nets that protect the inevitable losers, while highlighting the overall benefits that such integration affords.
Actions against perpetrators – for example, firms and countries that brazenly steal intellectual property – may also be needed, despite the potential costs.
Meanwhile, policymakers will need to do a better job of managing financial integration – a task that may be all the more challenging, because no political constituency is really demanding it.
Given finance’s nebulous, almost phantom-like nature, which eludes easy narrative-building, the task of taming it will be difficult.
But tame it we must.
How Can We Retain the Benefits of Globalization?
ROME – In the last few years, for many people and their leaders, globalization has become a scourge to be purged in favor of greater protectionism and unilateralism.
This represents a sharp departure from the recent past, when globalization was widely regarded as a positive force.
What changed, and why?
Key components of globalization include greater cross-border mobility of goods, labor, and capital, each of which promises significant overall benefits for economies.
Free trade enables countries to capitalize on their comparative advantages, boosting all participants’ economic performance and prospects.
Migration can inject diversity and dynamism into, say, an aging society, while helping to reduce poverty in source countries, such as through remittances.
And foreign direct investment (FDI) can create employment, spur research and development, generate tax revenues, and enhance competition.
The problem is that these benefits are not necessarily broadly shared.
For example, migration can put wage pressure on lower-skill workers in destination countries.
By enabling companies to move operations to lower-wage markets, the elimination of trade barriers can have a similar effect.
Even cross-border investment has its downsides, as domestic players may struggle to compete with foreigners.
Such factors have contributed to rising inequality in many countries.
In the United States, for example, lower-skill workers in the Rust Belt – the manufacturing region stretching from Michigan to eastern Pennsylvania – have faced decades of stagnant wages, while high-skill workers in finance and technology – Wall Street and Silicon Valley – have enjoyed soaring compensation.
While economic openness boosts economies as a whole, there is an obvious need to ensure that the benefits are more equitably distributed or, at least, that some groups are not inordinately hurt by it.
Many economists argue that the key to success on this front is to adopt redistributive policies, typically via the tax system.
But such policies are very difficult, if not impossible, politically.
That lesson has been learned by many a progressive politician, including US Senator Bernie Sanders, who tried and failed to secure the Democratic nomination for the 2016 US presidential election on a platform that focused on addressing people’s frustrations with the increasingly unequal status quo, largely through redistribution.
More politically effective, but economically and socially damaging, is the approach of populists like US President Donald Trump, who offer simplistic explanations that play on voters’ fears and frustrations (for example, by blaming immigrants or countries with trade surpluses) while pretending that there are easy fixes (say, erecting walls and import barriers).
Trump blamed the struggles of Rust Belt workers on international competition.
But that is only part of the story: technological displacement has played a larger role, though this has often been ignored, not least because it is harder to demonize.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration has pursued extreme and morally unconscionable anti-immigration policies, such as the recently reversed policy of separating migrant children from their families at the southern border with Mexico.
Similarly, in many European countries, the backlash against globalization has translated into virulent opposition to migration, not to mention increased resistance to European integration.
Voters in Austria, Hungary, and Italy have elected politicians who campaigned explicitly against immigration.
In the United Kingdom, the 2016 Brexit referendum partly reflected a rejection of the free movement of people within the European Union.
By encouraging unilateralism, and to some extent even authoritarianism, the backlash against globalization threatens not only to prevent countries from reaping the economic benefits of openness, but also to undermine the structures of international cooperation that have supported nearly three-quarters of a century of relative peace since World War II.
Reversing this trend will require, of course, the unequivocal rejection of policies that flout democratic values and repudiation of the leaders who advocate and implement them.
But it will also demand efforts to address globalization’s real negative effects – beginning with an excessively unequal income distribution.
Here, measures like a carbon price or a “Tobin tax” on international financial transactions could help.
In my country, Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s administration may need to consider direct wage hikes.
Today’s globalized world is far from perfect.
But protectionist and isolationist policies will only make things worse, especially if they are used as an excuse to deny basic human rights to immigrants, among others.
Balanced policies aimed at reaping the benefits of openness – and ensuring that those benefits are broadly shared – may not be the most politically expedient option today; but they would do economies and societies a lot of good tomorrow.
Globalization with Chinese Characteristics
BERKELEY – US President Donald Trump’s erratic unilateralism represents nothing less than abdication of global economic and political leadership.
Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, his rejection of the Iran nuclear deal, his tariff war, and his frequent attacks on allies and embrace of adversaries have rapidly turned the United States into an unreliable partner in upholding the international order.
But the administration’s “America First” policies have done more than disqualify the US from global leadership.
They have also created space for other countries to re-shape the international system to their liking. The influence of China, in particular, is likely to be enhanced.
Consider, for example, that if the European Union perceives the US as an unreliable trade partner, it will have a correspondingly stronger incentive to negotiate a trade deal with China on terms acceptable to President Xi Jinping’s government.
More generally, if the US turns its back on the global order, China will be well positioned to take the lead on reforming the rules of international trade and investment.
So the key question facing the world is this: what does China want?
What kind of international economic order do its leaders have in mind?
To start, China is likely to remain a proponent of export-led growth.
As Xi put it at Davos in 2017, China is committed “to growing an open global economy.”
Xi and his circle obviously will not want to dismantle the global trading system.
But in other respects, globalization with Chinese characteristics will differ from globalization as we know it.
Compared to standard post-World War II practice, China relies more on bilateral and regional trade agreements and less on multilateral negotiating rounds.
In 2002, China signed the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
It has subsequently negotiated bilateral free-trade agreements with 12 additional countries.
Insofar as China continues to emphasize bilateral agreements over multilateral negotiations, its approach implies a diminished role for the World Trade Organization (WTO).
The Chinese State Council has called for a trade strategy that is “based in China’s periphery, radiates along the Belt and Road, and faces the world.”
This suggests that Chinese leaders have in mind a hub-and-spoke system, with China the hub and countries on its periphery the spokes.
Others foresee the emergence of hub-and-spoke trading systems centered on China and also possibly on Europe and the United States – a scenario that becomes more likely as China begins to re-shape the global trading system.
The government may then elaborate other China-centered institutional arrangements to complement its trade strategy. That process has already begun.
The authorities have established the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, headed by Jin Liqun, as a regional alternative to the World Bank.
The People’s Bank of China has made $500 billion of swap lines available to more than 30 central banks, challenging the role of the International Monetary Fund.
Illustrating China’s leverage, in 2016 the state-run China Development Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China provided $900 million of emergency assistance to Pakistan, helping its government avoid, or at least delay, recourse to the IMF.
A China-shaped international system will also attach less weight to intellectual property rights.
While one can imagine the Chinese government’s attitude changing as the country becomes a developer of new technology, the sanctity of private property has always been limited in China’s state socialist system.
Hence intellectual property protections are likely to be weaker than in a US-led international regime.
China’s government seeks to shape its economy through subsidies and directives to state-owned enterprises and others.
Its Made in China 2025 plan to promote the country’s high-tech capabilities is only the latest incarnation of this approach.
The WTO has rules intended to limit subsidies. A China-shaped trading system would, at a minimum, loosen such constraints.
A China-led international regime would also be less open to inflows of foreign direct investment.
In 2017, China ranked behind only the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia among the 60-plus countries rated by the OECD according to the restrictiveness of their inward FDI regimes.
These restrictions are yet another device designed to give Chinese companies space to develop their technological capabilities.
The government would presumably favor a system that authorizes other countries to use such policies.
In this world, US multinationals seeking to operate abroad would face new hurdles.
Finally, China continues to exercise tight control over its financial system, as well as maintaining restrictions on capital inflows and outflows.
While the IMF has recently evinced more sympathy for such controls, a China-led international regime would be even more accommodating of their use.
The result would be additional barriers to US financial institutions seeking to do business internationally.
In sum, while a China-led global economy will remain open to trade, it will be less respectful of US intellectual property, less receptive to US foreign investment, and less accommodating of US exporters and multinationals seeking a level playing field.
This is the opposite of what the Trump administration says it wants. But it is the system that the administration’s own policies are likely to beget.
When Globalization Goes Digital
WASHINGTON, DC – American voters are angry.
But while the ill effects of globalization top their list of grievances, nobody is well served when complex economic issues are reduced to bumper-sticker slogans – as they have been thus far in the presidential campaign.
It is unfair to dismiss concerns about globalization as unfounded.
America deserves to have an honest debate about its effects.
In order to yield constructive solutions, however, all sides will need to concede some inconvenient truths – and to recognize that globalization is not the same phenomenon it was 20 years ago.
Protectionists fail to see how the United States’ eroding industrial base is compatible with the principle that globalization boosts growth.
But the evidence supporting that principle is too substantial to ignore.
Recent research by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) echoes the findings of other academics: global flows of goods, foreign direct investment, and data have increased global GDP by roughly 10% compared to what it would have been had those flows never occurred.
The extra value provided by globalization amounted to $7.8 trillion in 2014 alone.
And yet, the shuttered factories dotting America’s Midwestern “Rust Belt” are real.
Even as globalization generates aggregate growth, it produces winners and losers.
Exposing local industries to international competition spurs efficiency and innovation, but the resulting creative destruction exacts a substantial toll on families and communities.
Economists and policymakers alike are guilty of glossing over these distributional consequences.
Countries that engage in free trade will find new channels for growth in the long run, the thinking goes, and workers who lose their jobs in one industry will find employment in another.
In the real world, however, this process is messy and protracted.
Workers in a shrinking industry may need entirely new skills to find jobs in other sectors, and they may have to pack up their families and pull up deep roots to pursue these opportunities.
It has taken a popular backlash against free trade for policymakers and the media to acknowledge the extent of this disruption.
That backlash should not have come as a surprise.
Traditional labor-market policies and training systems have not been equal to the task of dealing with the large-scale changes caused by the twin forces of globalization and automation.
The US needs concrete proposals for supporting workers caught up in structural transitions – and a willingness to consider fresh approaches, such as wage insurance.
Contrary to campaign rhetoric, simple protectionism would harm consumers.
A recent study by the US President’s Council of Economic Advisers found that middle-class Americans gain more than a quarter of their purchasing power from trade.
In any event, imposing tariffs on foreign goods will not bring back lost manufacturing jobs.
It is time to change the parameters of the debate and recognize that globalization has become an entirely different animal: The global goods trade has flattened for a variety of reasons, including plummeting commodity prices, sluggishness in many major economies, and a trend toward producing goods closer to the point of consumption.
Cross-border flows of data, by contrast, have grown by a factor of 45 during the past decade, and now generate a greater economic impact than flows of traditional manufactured goods.
Digitization is changing everything: the nature of the goods changing hands, the universe of potential suppliers and customers, the method of delivery, and the capital and scale required to operate globally.
It also means that globalization is no longer exclusively the domain of Fortune 500 firms.
Companies interacting with their foreign operations, suppliers, and customers account for a large and growing share of global Internet traffic.
Already half of the world’s traded services are digitized, and 12% of the global goods trade is conducted via international e-commerce.
E-commerce marketplaces such as Alibaba, Amazon, and eBay are turning millions of small enterprises into exporters.
This remains an enormous untapped opportunity for the US, where fewer than 1% of companies export – a far lower share than in any other advanced economy.
Despite all the anti-trade rhetoric, it is crucial that Americans bear in mind that most of the world’s customers are overseas.
Fast-growing emerging economies will be the biggest sources of consumption growth in the years ahead.
This would be the worst possible moment to erect barriers.
The new digital landscape is still taking shape, and countries have an opportunity to redefine their comparative advantages.
The US may have lost out as the world chased low labor costs; but it operates from a position of strength in a world defined by digital globalization.
There is real value in the seamless movement of innovation, information, goods, services, and – yes – people.
As the US struggles to jump-start its economy, it cannot afford to seal itself off from an important source of growth.
US policymakers must take a nuanced, clear-eyed view of globalization, one that addresses its downsides more effectively, not only when it comes to lost jobs at home, but also when it comes to its trading partners’ labor and environmental standards.
Above all, the US needs to stop retrying the past – and start focusing on how it can compete in the next era of globalization.
Global Politics for a Globalized Economy
WASHINGTON, DC – From the end of World War II to the mid-2010s, economic globalization progressed relentlessly through expanded trade, proliferating capital flows, faster (and cheaper) communication, and, to a lesser extent, human migration.
Yet, even as these linkages have deepened and multiplied, the global economy has remained fundamentally a collection of national economies, each embedded in national politics.
This is now changing.
In the democratic countries that have built the market capitalism that dominates the world today, the building blocks of the economy – taxation, public spending, and regulatory frameworks – are enacted by the legislature and interpreted by the legal system.
This lends legitimacy to them and the economic activities they facilitate.
But a shift is occurring: global markets already are more important than national markets for small and medium-size countries, and they are approaching that status for large economies.
In less than a decade, it will be the huge world market, rather than national markets, that allocates capital, finance, and skilled labor.
Many firms will be truly multinational, with headquarters located in one place (probably where tax liabilities can be minimized), production and sales happening largely elsewhere, and managers and workers sourced from all over the world.
The emergence of such a truly global capitalism – a process that, to be sure, is far from complete – means that markets will no longer be embedded in the politics or regulatory systems of various nation-states.
If they are to produce desirable outcomes, they will need to be embedded more deeply in – and regulated more effectively by – global institutions.
Of course, international economic institutions – from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to the economic bodies of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization – already exist and have long served as platforms for member states to adopt shared rules.
The IMF and the WTO, in particular, have acquired some real regulatory authority in macroeconomic and trade policy, respectively.
Domestic politics were largely eschewed in establishing and sustaining these international institutions.
Though treasuries, central banks, and trade ministries – especially of the advanced countries – acted politically, they did so with very little public debate.
Even today, the average citizen in the United States, France, or India knows little about what the WTO actually does.
In other words, the emergence of a global market is not embedded in any legitimacy-conferring political process.
Multilateral institutions are thus viewed as elitist, making them a political target.
This is reminiscent of the European Union’s “democratic deficit,” which has fueled resistance to further integration.
In fact, resistance to global capitalism is also rampant and rising.
In particular, US President Donald Trump espouses a kind of “go-it-alone” neo-nationalism.
Far from deepening multilateral structures, he wants to dismantle them, dislodging the global market from the regulatory institutions in which it is already only weakly embedded.
At both the national and international levels, Trump believes that the less regulation, the better.
The EU, meanwhile, pursues the opposite line.
Despite the internal challenges it faces, it continues to try to regulate markets beyond national borders.
This year alone, the European Commission has imposed over €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in fines on Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent company, and Qualcomm for breaching antitrust restrictions.
And with its General Data Protection Regulation, the EU has sought to tighten restrictions on the use, sharing, and control of personal data.
Because the EU has such a large market, such actions have a far-reaching impact.
But when it comes to setting truly international standards, the EU obviously falls short.
This has become all the more true with figures like Trump actively working against its efforts and espousing deregulation at a time when the level of global economic interconnectedness demands just the opposite.
Allowing major multinational companies, which are already reaping massive profits and crowding smaller players out of entire industries, to avoid paying much tax does far-reaching damage, not least by exacerbating inequality and weakening public budgets.
But such firms can be regulated effectively only through multilateral cooperation.
Likewise, the only way to make any headway on combating the effects of climate change is for all countries to work together.
The realities of today’s global economy demand that we make multilateral institutions work.
That means not only increasing the clout of existing institutions – here, reform is a prerequisite – but also establishing new institutions, such as a Global Competition Authority.
None of this will be possible without a real global political debate.
Of course, the emergence of a global politics has far-reaching potential implications for traditional ideas about democracy, not to mention national sovereignty.
At the same time, however, allowing the global market to function without adapted regulation, enacted by legitimate and effective international institutions, would amount to abandoning the essence of democracy.
The challenge ahead has been presented by Harvard economist Dani Rodrik in the form of a trilemma: when it comes to democracy, national sovereignty, and globalization, we can have any two, but never all three.
Rodrik advocates less globalization and more democracy.
Nationalists like Trump prefer strengthening the nation-state, in ways that could weaken both democracy and globalization, at least in the longer term.
In the medium term, however, further globalization seems unavoidable, meaning that it is the nation-state, and national politics, that must be constrained.
One way to lend legitimacy to the new global politics would be to ensure that it is grounded at the local level.
This will require local political leaders to adopt a narrative that explains how global problems impact their constituents.
Climate change is a successful example of this form of localized global politics.
Whatever institutional arrangements are chosen, ensuring that a new global politics strengthens, rather than undermines, democracy is the central political challenge of the twenty-first century.
We can no longer afford to shy away from it.
The Two Backlashes Against Globalization
NEW DELHI – When I left India for graduate school in the United States in 1975, the word “globalization” was not in use anywhere in the world.
Back then, crossing borders was still a big deal, and getting a US visa was no easy feat.
When I did arrive in America, to be an Indian still carried a whiff of the exotic and the unfamiliar.
Nowadays, globalization is inescapable.
Over the course of less than three decades, trade barriers came down, and the combination of accessible airplane travel, satellite television, and the Internet has created a kind of interconnected “global village.”
But two types of backlash are now casting doubt on globalization’s future.
The 2008 economic crisis seems to have been the turning point in public perception.
In the years leading up to the crisis, millions of people rose out of poverty, and democracy became more widespread than ever, creating the general sense that a golden age had begun.
Francis Fukuyama famously argued that in the grand global struggle over the future of human political and economic organization, the forces of democracy and liberal capitalism had won a definitive victory.
Then crisis struck, and the hubris of that era was quickly discredited.
People began to note a distinct and deepening disparity between globalization’s winners and losers, with weak wage growth accompanied by robust returns for the wealthy.
In the United Kingdom, for example, wages have grown by only 13% since 2008, but the stock market is up by 115%.
According to an annual Credit Suisse report, wealth inequality is now growing sharply in 35 of 46 major economies, compared to just 12 before 2007.
In the developed world, the poor and the unemployed began to feel that they had no stake in the globalized system.
They condemned the political establishment for pursuing policies that sent their jobs to faraway lands like China and India.
And they demanded a return to the old economic order, and thus to the promise that each new generation would earn more and live better than the last.
But the backlash against economic globalization is only half of the story.
There has also been a backlash against cultural globalization – encompassing cosmopolitanism, multiculturalism, and secularism – driven by those who seek the comforts of traditional ethnic, religious, or national identity.
This identity-focused backlash is exemplified by US President Donald Trump, whose slogan, “Make America Great Again,” was code for “Make America White Again” – a message that appealed to the unemployed, bitter, and increasingly xenophobic white blue-collar voters that formed the core of Trump’s base.
But the America that Trump promised isn’t coming back: by 2030, a majority of the American labor force will be non-white.
While Trump is often viewed as a uniquely American phenomenon, he is actually just one part of a broader revolt by nationalists and traditionalists against a liberal globalist and cosmopolitan elite, in the name of a more religiously and culturally rooted identity.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and, in his own way, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are all capitalizing on this trend.
Even in places where far-right, xenophobic, and nationalist parties and politicians have not won power, they have made strides, as the Alternative für Deutschland did in Germany’s recent federal election.
Yet the resentment toward the so-called elites into which such leaders have tapped can be seen on the left as well.
Consider the Occupy Wall Street movement in the US, which comprised young people claiming to represent the 99% who were left behind as the 1% continued to thrive.
The Democratic Party insurgency, led by Senator Bernie Sanders, opposed Hillary Clinton for much the same reason their right-wing counterparts did: with her well-paid speeches at Goldman Sachs, she was viewed as a representative of the Wall Street-linked globalized elite.
Similar anti-elite sentiment, fueled partly by working-class resentment of cosmopolitanism and economic inequality, underpinned the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union.
There are now 1,800 billionaires globally, 70 of whom live in wealthy and cosmopolitan London, where residents overwhelmingly opposed Brexit.
But opposition to the EU was compounded by more fundamental issues of nationalism and identity, including citizens’ distaste for the large numbers of non-English-speaking immigrants from other member countries.
The economic and cultural backlashes against globalization do not always overlap.
While Erdoğan and Modi, like Xi Jinping in China, promise national reassertion, they are still economic globalizers – the “Davos Man” who has come to represent the global elite.
But the current specter of economic uncertainty is now reinforcing their nativism and chauvinism, just when similar tendencies are on the rise in the West.
Taken together, the two types of backlash against globalization explain why protectionist barriers to the free flow of goods, capital, and labor have been erected even in developed Western countries that long advocated greater openness.
The numbers speak for themselves.
In 2007, global capital flows reached a record high of $12.4 trillion, or 21% of the global economy.
By 2016 the annual total had plummeted to $4.3 trillion, or 6% of the global economy – a lower share than in 1980.
With total economic growth outpacing world trade growth of less than 2.5%, globalization has been rolled back decades.
Yet, while globalization isn’t perfect, it has pulled millions out of poverty in developing countries like China and India, created new markets for goods made by poor countries, and reduced prices for rich-country consumers.
The economic and cultural backlash must be resisted, and the promise of global integration realized for all.
Rethinking Robin Hood
MADRID – International development aid is based on the Robin Hood principle: take from the rich and give to the poor.
National development agencies, multilateral organizations, and NGOs currently transfer more than $135 billion a year from rich countries to poor countries with this idea in mind.
A more formal term for the Robin Hood principle is “cosmopolitan prioritarianism,” an ethical rule that says we should think of everyone in the world in the same way, no matter where they live, and then focus help where it helps the most.
Those who have less have priority over those who have more.
This philosophy implicitly or explicitly guides the aid for economic development, aid for health, and aid for humanitarian emergencies.
On its face, cosmopolitan prioritarianism makes sense.
People in poor countries have needs that are more pressing, and price levels are much lower in poor countries, so that a dollar or euro goes twice or three times further than it does at home.
Spending at home is not only more expensive, but it also goes to those who are already well off (at least relatively, judged by global standards), and so does less good.
I have thought about and tried to measure global poverty for many years, and this guide has always seemed broadly right.
But I currently find myself feeling increasingly unsure about it.
Both facts and ethics pose problems.
Huge strides have undoubtedly been made in reducing global poverty, more through growth and globalization than through aid from abroad.
The number of poor people has fallen in the past 40 years from more than two billion to just under one billion – a remarkable feat, given the increase in world population and the long-term slowing of global economic growth, especially since 2008.
While impressive and wholly welcome, poverty reduction has not come without a cost.
The globalization that has rescued so many in poor countries has harmed some people in rich countries, as factories and jobs migrated to where labor is cheaper.
This seemed to be an ethically acceptable price to pay, because those who were losing were already so much wealthier (and healthier) than those who were gaining.
A long-standing cause of discomfort is that those of us who make these judgments are not exactly well placed to assess the costs.
Like many in academia and in the development industry, I am among globalization’s greatest beneficiaries – those who are able to sell our services in markets that are larger and richer than our parents could have dreamed of.
Globalization is less splendid for those who not only don’t reap its benefits, but suffer from its impact.
We have long known that less-educated and lower-income Americans, for example, have seen little economic gain for four decades, and that the bottom end of the US labor market can be a brutal environment.
But just how badly are these Americans suffering from globalization?
Are they much better off than the Asians now working in the factories that used to be in their hometowns?
Most undoubtedly are.
But several million Americans – black, white, and Hispanic – now live in households with per capita income of less than $2 a day, essentially the same standard that the World Bank uses to define destitution-level poverty in India or Africa.
Finding shelter in the United States on that income is so difficult that $2-a-day poverty is almost certainly much worse in the US than $2-a-day poverty in India or Africa.
Beyond that, America’s much-vaunted equality of opportunity is under threat.
Towns and cities that have lost their factories to globalization have also lost their tax base and find it hard to maintain quality schools – the escape route for the next generation.
Elite schools recruit the wealthy to pay their bills, and court minorities to redress centuries of discrimination; but this no doubt fosters resentment among the white working class, whose kids find no place in this brave new world.
My own work with Anne Case reveals more signs of distress.
We have documented a rising tide of “deaths of despair” among white non-Hispanics – from suicide, alcohol abuse, and accidental overdoses of prescription and illegal drugs.
Overall death rates in the US were higher in 2015 than 2014, and life expectancy has fallen.
We can argue about the measurement of material living standards, whether inflation is overstated and the rise in living standards understated, or whether schools are really that bad everywhere.
But deaths are hard to explain away.
Perhaps it is not so clear that the greatest needs are on the other side of the world.
Citizenship comes with a set of rights and responsibilities that we do not share with those in other countries.
Yet the “cosmopolitan” part of the ethical guideline ignores any special obligations we have toward our fellow citizens.
We can think about these rights and obligations as a kind of mutual insurance contract: We refuse to tolerate certain kinds of inequality for our fellow citizens, and each of us has a responsibility to help – and a right to expect help – in the face of collective threats.
These responsibilities do not invalidate or override our responsibilities to those who are suffering elsewhere in the world, but they do mean that if we judge only by material need, we risk leaving out important considerations.
When citizens believe that the elite care more about those across the ocean than those across the train tracks, insurance has broken down, we divide into factions, and those who are left behind become angry and disillusioned with a politics that no longer serves them.
We may not agree with the remedies that they seek, but we ignore their real grievances at their peril and ours.
Globalization Marches On
LONDON – In a recent symposium in the Financial Times on globalization’s prospects in 2011, the columnist Gideon Rachman observed that, “When Barack Obama visited India recently, the US President warned his hosts that the debate about globalization has reopened in the West,” and that “a backlash…is forming…and growing in advanced economies.”
But Rachman’s alarmism is misplaced.
The fear of globalization in the West is nothing new.
Articulate intellectuals and groups such as labor unions and environmental organizations in the advanced economies have voiced anti-globalization fears and sentiments for at least a quarter-century.
The fear of globalization, however, began historically in the East, not the West.
After World War II, the West dismantled barriers to trade and investment flows, and worked to eliminate exchange controls and move to currency convertibility.
What was sometimes called the liberal international economic order was the order of the day, and it was embraced by public opinion as well.
By contrast, the East generally embraced the fearful view that, as the Chilean sociologist Oswaldo Sunkel put it, integration into the international economy would lead to disintegration of the national economy.
Many intellectuals shared this dark anti-globalization vision, and policymakers in much of the East were not far behind.
Indeed, the West accepted the view that globalization would result (as with trade) in mutual gain, embracing what I called in 1997 the notion of “benign neglect.”
In the case of foreign investment and aid flows, the West went further, viewing them as being motivated by altruism, or “benign intent,” whereas the East regarded globalization in a world of poor and rich nations as implying “malign impact.”
In some analyses, malign impact turned into a more sinister “malign intent.”
Thus, foreign aid was regarded as a plot to trap poor nations in a neo-colonial embrace.
What happened next was what I have called an “ironic reversal.”
As the benefits of globalization became manifest, and the damage wrought by autarkic policies also became evident, policymakers in the East began to appreciate that their anti-globalization stance had been a mistake.
But then fear of globalization moved to the West.
The East had feared that it could not gain from trade with the West, which had superior infrastructure and human capital; now, the West had come to fear that it would lose from trade with the East, which had abundant, cheap labor.
The longstanding stagnation in wages for unskilled labor was attributed to low-cost, labor-intensive imports, ignoring the corollary that Western workers’ consumption of labor-intensive Asian goods offset the effect on real wages.
To take another example, the East worried about a “brain drain” of professionals to the West, where opportunities seemed to be more plentiful.
Today, the West is witnessing anti-globalization opposition from members of professional groups, who fear the loss of their jobs to foreign counterparts.
Rudyard Kipling famously wrote in “The Ballad of East and West”: “Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.”
Given the ironic reversal of globalization fears, Kipling is still right: convergence has continued to elude East and West.
The current crisis did not create the debate about globalization now heard in the West; it only made it slightly more salient.
Yet the crisis may be tilting Western policy outcomes in favor of globalization.
For example, on trade, there has been a remarkable commitment to efforts – largely successful – to avoid significant backsliding into protectionism.
Moreover, the G-20 leaders have continued to express the need to conclude the Doha Round of multilateral trade-liberalization negotiations.
There are also initiatives such as the appointment by the governments of Britain, Germany, Indonesia, and Turkey of a High-Level Expert Trade Group, with Peter Sutherland, former Director General of GATT and the WTO, and myself as co-chairs.
The four governments will report at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos on how to conclude Doha this year.
In other words, Kipling could yet be proved wrong.
A reversal in the West is possible, perhaps even likely.
So the current crisis may thus, accidentally, establish a pro-globalization consensus that spans East and West.
Globalization and its New Discontents
NEW YORK – Fifteen years ago, I wrote a little book, entitled Globalization and its Discontents, describing growing opposition in the developing world to globalizing reforms.
It seemed a mystery: people in developing countries had been told that globalization would increase overall wellbeing. So why had so many people become so hostile to it?
Now, globalization’s opponents in the emerging markets and developing countries have been joined by tens of millions in the advanced countries.
Opinion polls, including a careful study by Stanley Greenberg and his associates for the Roosevelt Institute, show that trade is among the major sources of discontent for a large share of Americans.
Similar views are apparent in Europe.
How can something that our political leaders – and many an economist – said would make everyone better off be so reviled?
One answer occasionally heard from the neoliberal economists who advocated for these policies is that people are better off.
They just don’t know it. Their discontent is a matter for psychiatrists, not economists.
But income data suggest that it is the neoliberals who may benefit from therapy. Large segments of the population in advanced countries have not been doing well: in the US, the bottom 90% has endured income stagnation for a third of a century.
Median income for full-time male workers is actually lower in real (inflation-adjusted) terms than it was 42 years ago.
At the bottom, real wages are comparable to their level 60 years ago.
The effects of the economic pain and dislocation that many Americans are experiencing are even showing up in health statistics.
For example, the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton, this year’s Nobel laureate, have shown that life expectancy among segments of white Americans is declining.
Things are a little better in Europe – but only a little better.
Branko Milanovic’s new book Global Inequality: A New Approach for the Age of Globalization provides some vital insights, looking at the big winners and losers in terms of income over the two decades from 1988 to 2008.
Among the big winners were the global 1%, the world’s plutocrats, but also the middle class in newly emerging economies.
Among the big losers – those who gained little or nothing – were those at the bottom and the middle and working classes in the advanced countries.
Globalization is not the only reason, but it is one of the reasons.
Under the assumption of perfect markets (which underlies most neoliberal economic analyses), free trade equalizes the wages of unskilled workers around the world.
Trade in goods is a substitute for the movement of people. Importing goods from China – goods that require a lot of unskilled workers to produce – reduces the demand for unskilled workers in Europe and the US.
This force is so strong that if there were no transportation costs, and if the US and Europe had no other source of competitive advantage, such as in technology, eventually it would be as if Chinese workers continued to migrate to the US and Europe until wage differences had been eliminated entirely.
Not surprisingly, the neoliberals never advertised this consequence of trade liberalization, as they claimed – one could say lied – that all would benefit.
The failure of globalization to deliver on the promises of mainstream politicians has surely undermined trust and confidence in the “establishment.”
And governments’ offers of generous bailouts for the banks that had brought on the 2008 financial crisis, while leaving ordinary citizens largely to fend for themselves, reinforced the view that this failure was not merely a matter of economic misjudgments.
In the US, Congressional Republicans even opposed assistance to those who were directly hurt by globalization.
More generally, neoliberals, apparently worried about adverse incentive effects, have opposed welfare measures that would have protected the losers.
But they can’t have it both ways: if globalization is to benefit most members of society, strong social-protection measures must be in place.
The Scandinavians figured this out long ago; it was part of the social contract that maintained an open society – open to globalization and changes in technology.
Neoliberals elsewhere have not – and now, in elections in the US and Europe, they are having their comeuppance.
Globalization is, of course, only one part of what is going on; technological innovation is another part.
But all of this openness and disruption were supposed to make us richer, and the advanced countries could have introduced policies to ensure that the gains were widely shared.
Instead, they pushed for policies that restructured markets in ways that increased inequality and undermined overall economic performance; growth actually slowed as the rules of the game were rewritten to advance the interests of banks and corporations – the rich and powerful – at the expense of everyone else.
Workers’ bargaining power was weakened; in the US, at least, competition laws didn’t keep up with the times; and existing laws were inadequately enforced.
Financialization continued apace and corporate governance worsened.
Now, as I point out in my recent book Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy, the rules of the game need to be changed again – and this must include measures to tame globalization.
The two new large agreements that President Barack Obama has been pushing – the Trans-Pacific Partnership between the US and 11 Pacific Rim countries, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the EU and the US – are moves in the wrong direction.
The main message of Globalization and its Discontents was that the problem was not globalization, but how the process was being managed.
Unfortunately, the management didn’t change.
Fifteen years later, the new discontents have brought that message home to the advanced economies.
Debunking America’s Populist Narrative
BERKELEY – One does not need to be particularly good at hearing to decipher the dog whistles being used during this year’s election campaign in the United States.
Listen even briefly, and you will understand that Mexicans and Chinese are working with Wall Street to forge lousy trade deals that rob American workers of their rightful jobs, and that Muslims want to blow everyone up.
All of this fear mongering is scarier than the usual election-year fare.
It is frightening to people in foreign countries, who can conclude only that voters in the world’s only superpower have become dangerously unbalanced.
And it is frightening to Americans, who until recently believed – or perhaps hoped – that they were living in a republic based on the traditions established by George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt.
But what is even more unsettling is the political reality this rhetoric reflects.
There can be no comparing Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s policy-oriented critique of neoliberalism to the incoherent bluster of Donald Trump or Ted Cruz on the Republican side.
And yet, on both the right and the left, a common narrative is emerging – one that seeks to explain why the incomes of working- and middle-class Americans have stagnated over the past generation.
Unfortunately, this narrative, if used as a basis for policymaking, will benefit neither the US nor the rest of the world; worse, it has yet to be seriously challenged.
For decades, senior Republican politicians and intellectuals have been uninterested in educating the American people about the realities of economic policy.
And Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has been too busy trying to fend off Sanders’s challenge.
Broadly, the narrative goes something like this.
American middle- and working-class wages have stagnated because Wall Street pressed companies to outsource the valuable jobs that made up America’s manufacturing base, first to low-wage Mexicans and then to the Chinese.
Moreover, this was a bipartisan effort, with both parties unified behind financial deregulation and trade deals that undermined the US economy.
First, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) led to the export of high-quality manufacturing jobs to Mexico.
Then the US established permanent normal trade relations with China and refused to brand its government a currency manipulator.
The reason this narrative is wrong is simple.
There are good reasons why the US adopted policies that encouraged poorer countries to grow rapidly through export-led industrialization.
In helping Mexico, China, and other developing countries grow, the US is gaining richer trading partners.
Furthermore, there is a strong case that US national security will be improved if, 50 years from now, schoolchildren around the world learn how America helped their countries prosper, rather than trying to keep them as poor as possible for as long as possible.
It was not globalization that caused incomes to stagnate.
Trade with countries like China and Mexico is just one factor affecting income distribution in the US, and it is by no means the most important one.
The reason that incomes have stagnated is that American politicians have failed to implement policies to manage globalization’s effects.
As Steve Cohen and I argue in our book Concrete Economics, macroeconomic management requires the government to do what it always did before 1980: pragmatically adopt policies that promote equitable growth.
There were good reasons for the US to offload industries that required low wages to be globally competitive.
But there was little reason for the US to offload industries that had become important “technology drivers.”
Nor were there good reasons for a lot of other bad decisions, such as allowing the financial industry to profit by convincing investors to bear risks they should not and allowing health-care providers to profit from administration at the expense of the care and treatment of the sick.
Other bad decisions include incarcerating 2% of the country’s young men and concluding that America’s economic problems would be solved if only the rich could keep more of their money.
It is not difficult to see where the blame lies.
As Mark Kleiman of NYU’s Marron Institute points out, the Republican Party’s rigid and die-hard ideological opposition to “taxing the rich [has] destroyed, on a practical level, the theoretical basis for believing that free trade benefits everyone.”
It is difficult to argue for redistributing the benefits of globalization when you believe that the market channels gains to those who deserve them.
Nor can you ameliorate the painful effects of globalization if you believe that social-insurance programs turn their beneficiaries into lethargic “takers.”
It is not globalization, poor negotiation tactics, low-wage Mexicans workers, or the overly clever Chinese that bear responsibility for what is ailing America.
The responsibility lies instead with politicians peddling ideology over practicality – and thus with the citizens who elect them, as well as those who don’t bother to vote at all.
The Globalization of Our Discontent
NEW YORK – Fifteen years ago, I published Globalization and Its Discontents, a book that sought to explain why there was so much dissatisfaction with globalization within the developing countries.
Quite simply, many believed that the system was “rigged” against them, and global trade agreements were singled out for being particularly unfair.
Now discontent with globalization has fueled a wave of populism in the United States and other advanced economies, led by politicians who claim that the system is unfair to their countries.
In the US, President Donald Trump insists that America’s trade negotiators were snookered by those from Mexico and China.
So how could something that was supposed to benefit all, in developed and developing countries alike, now be reviled almost everywhere?
How can a trade agreement be unfair to all parties?
To those in developing countries, Trump’s claims – like Trump himself – are laughable.
The US basically wrote the rules and created the institutions of globalization.
In some of these institutions – for example, the International Monetary Fund – the US still has veto power, despite America’s diminished role in the global economy (a role which Trump seems determined to diminish still further).
To someone like me, who has watched trade negotiations closely for more than a quarter-century, it is clear that US trade negotiators got most of what they wanted.
The problem was with what they wanted.
Their agenda was set, behind closed doors, by corporations.
It was an agenda written by and for large multinational companies, at the expense of workers and ordinary citizens everywhere.
Indeed, it often seems that workers, who have seen their wages fall and jobs disappear, are just collateral damage – innocent but unavoidable victims in the inexorable march of economic progress.
But there is another interpretation of what has happened: one of the objectives of globalization was to weaken workers’ bargaining power.
What corporations wanted was cheaper labor, however they could get it.
This interpretation helps explain some puzzling aspects of trade agreements.
Why is it, for example, that advanced countries gave away one of their biggest advantages, the rule of law?
Indeed, provisions embedded in most recent trade agreements give foreign investors more rights than are provided to investors in the US.
They are compensated, for example, should the government adopt a regulation that hurts their bottom line, no matter how desirable the regulation or how great the harm caused by the corporation in its absence.
There are three responses to globalized discontent with globalization.
The first – call it the Las Vegas strategy – is to double down on the bet on globalization as it has been managed for the past quarter-century.
This bet, like all bets on proven policy failures (such as trickle-down economics) is based on the hope that somehow it will succeed in the future.
The second response is Trumpism: cut oneself off from globalization, in the hope that doing so will somehow bring back a bygone world.
But protectionism won’t work. Globally, manufacturing jobs are on the decline, simply because productivity growth has outpaced growth in demand.
Even if manufacturing were to come back, the jobs won’t.
Advanced manufacturing technology, including robots, means that the few jobs created will require higher skills and will be placed at different locations than the jobs that were lost.
Like doubling down, this approach is doomed to fail, further increasing the discontent felt by those left behind.
Trump will fail even in his proclaimed goal of reducing the trade deficit, which is determined by the disparity between domestic savings and investment.
Now that the Republicans have gotten their way and enacted a tax cut for billionaires, national savings will fall and the trade deficit will rise, owing to an increase in the value of the dollar. (Fiscal deficits and trade deficits normally move so closely together that they are called “twin” deficits.)
Trump may not like it, but as he is slowly finding out, there are some things that even a person in the most powerful position in the world cannot control.
There is a third approach: social protection without protectionism, the kind of approach that the small Nordic countries took. They knew that as small countries they had to remain open.
But they also knew that remaining open would expose workers to risk. Thus, they had to have a social contract that helped workers move from old jobs to new and provide some help in the interim.
The Nordic countries are deeply democratic societies, so they knew that unless most workers regarded globalization as benefiting them, it wouldn’t be sustained.
And the wealthy in these countries recognized that if globalization worked as it should, there would be enough benefits to go around.
American capitalism in recent years has been marked by unbridled greed – the 2008 financial crisis provides ample confirmation of that.
But, as some countries have shown, a market economy can take forms that temper the excesses of both capitalism and globalization, and deliver more sustainable growth and higher standards of living for most citizens.
We can learn from such successes what to do, just as we can learn from past mistakes what not to do.
As has become evident, if we do not manage globalization so that it benefits all, the backlash – from the New Discontents in the North and the Old Discontents in the South – is at risk of intensifying.
The West’s Decline Would Hurt China
HONG KONG – Official Chinese media are having a field day touting the dysfunction of Western democracies.
Between the British vote to “Brexit” the European Union and the nomination of Donald Trump as the Republican candidate for the US presidency, not to mention increasingly frequent terrorist attacks, they have plenty of evidence.
But the truth is that the West’s loss is not China’s gain.
The hope, of course, is that the current travails of democracies around the world could boost the credibility of the Chinese Communist Party.
And, indeed, a commentary in People’s Daily, the CCP’s official newspaper, portrayed the Brexit vote as a reflection of the fundamental flaws of Western democracies.
The same paper used Trump’s rise to show that, in the American system, political leaders are “helpless” to address “complex social conflicts” like racial tensions and other sources of popular discontent.
The Global Times, an ultra-nationalist tabloid affiliated with the People’s Daily, seemed to suggest that recent terrorist attacks in the West were a harbinger of some kind of democratic apocalypse.
The West may be facing some mysterious and unthinkable “change,” intoned the tabloid.
Given the CCP’s ideological hostility to the West, and its zero-sum geopolitical mindset, such gloating should come as no surprise.
Indeed, the CCP has long used challenges that arise in democratic countries as part of its never-ending effort to enhance its own legitimacy.
Claiming that democracy barely works in the West, the Party argues that it would be disastrous for China.
Moreover, so long as China’s government is delivering consistently rising standards of living, as it has been over the last few decades, there is no need, according to the authorities, even to consider alternative systems.
But there is little evidence that democratic tumult translates into autocratic legitimacy.
On the contrary, dictatorships have historically fallen, regardless of the fortune of Western democracies.
When the so-called third wave of democratization began in the mid-1970s, Western democracies were mired in stagflation and the political trauma of the Vietnam War.
The fall of communism in the former Soviet bloc coincided with the reinvigoration of Western democracies in the 1980s.
When the Arab Spring erupted in 2011, Western democracies were struggling with the consequences of the global financial crisis of 2008.
All of this suggests that autocrats in China should not be holding their breath for some Brexit-induced surge in support.
Though stories of democratic dysfunction can give people living under autocratic rule a negative impression of democracy, the effect is most likely short-lived.
As long as dictatorships mistreat their own people and fail to improve their lives, their legitimacy will be challenged.
Of course, China is no ordinary autocracy.
But what makes it unique – the link between the CCP’s authority and its ability to sustain economic growth – does not make its gloating any more rational.
After all, one of the keys to China’s economic success is its integration into a global economy dominated by the Western democracies, which buy roughly 60% of Chinese exports.
In other words, the CCP derives more legitimacy from Western democracies’ success than it would from their failure.
No good businessperson would hope their best customers go bankrupt.
It makes little sense that the CCP is so pleased about the struggles of China’s most valuable trading partners.
The factors driving the challenges facing the Western democracies today hold even worse implications for China.
Support for Brexit and Trump is rooted largely in voters’ rejection of globalization.
Regardless of how Brexit or the US election plays out, it is very likely that governments in Western democracies will respond to voter angst and take measures that imply a return to some degree of protectionism.
As the world’s largest exporter, China will not escape the damaging economic consequences of such efforts.
In that context, the legitimacy of the CCP, already challenged by China’s economic slowdown, could erode further.
Instead of gloating, China’s leaders should be watching developments in the Western democracies with concern – and start planning for their own difficult times ahead.
Globalization’s Political Fault Lines
NEW YORK – The United Kingdom’s narrow vote to leave the European Union had specific British causes.
And yet it is also the proverbial canary in the coalmine, signaling a broad populist/nationalist backlash – at least in advanced economies – against globalization, free trade, offshoring, labor migration, market-oriented policies, supranational authorities, and even technological change.
All of these trends reduce wages and employment for low-skill workers in labor-scarce and capital-rich advanced economies, and raise them in labor-abundant emerging economies.
Consumers in advanced economies benefit from the reduction in prices of traded goods; but low and even some medium-skill workers lose income as their equilibrium wages fall and their jobs are threatened.
In the “Brexit” vote, the fault lines were clear: rich versus poor, gainers versus losers from trade/globalization, skilled versus unskilled, educated versus less educated, young versus old, urban versus rural, and diverse versus more homogenous communities.
The same fault lines are appearing in other advanced economies, including the United States and continental Europe.
With their more flexible economies and labor markets, the US and the UK have recovered more strongly than continental Europe in terms of GDP and employment since the 2008 global financial crisis.
Job creation has been robust, with the unemployment rate falling below 5%, even if real wages are not growing much.
Yet in the US, Donald Trump has become the hero of angry workers threatened by trade, migration, and technological change.
In the UK, the Brexit vote was heavily influenced by fear that immigrants from low-wage EU countries (the proverbial “Polish plumber”) were taking citizens’ jobs and public services.
In continental Europe and the eurozone, however, economic conditions are much worse.
The average unemployment rate hovers above 10% (and much higher in the eurozone periphery – more than 20% in Greece and Spain) with youth unemployment over 30%.
In most of these countries, job creation is anemic, real wages are falling, and dual labor markets mean that formal-sector, unionized workers have good wages and benefits, while younger workers have precarious jobs that pay lower wages, provide no employment security, and offer low or no benefits.
Politically, the strains of globalization are twofold.
First, establishment parties of the right and the left, which for more than a generation have supported free trade and globalization, are being challenged by populist, nativist/nationalist anti-establishment parties.
Second, establishment parties are being disrupted – if not destroyed – from within, as champions of anti-globalization emerge and challenge the mainstream orthodoxy.
Establishment parties were once controlled by globalization’s beneficiaries: capital owners; skilled, educated, and digitally savvy workers; urban and cosmopolitan elites; and unionized white- and blue-collar employees.
But they also included workers – both blue- and white-collar – who were among the losers from globalization, but who nonetheless remained loyal, either because they were socially and religiously conservative, or because center-left parties were formally supporters of unions, workers’ rights, and entitlement programs.
After the 2008 financial crisis, globalization’s losers started to organize and find anti-establishment champions on both the left and the right.
On the left, the losers in the UK and the US, especially young people, found champions in traditional center-left parties: Jeremy Corbyn in the UK’s Labour Party, and Bernie Sanders in America’s Democratic Party.
The deepest fault lines emerged among center-right parties.
These parties – the Republicans in the US, the Tories in the UK, and center-right parties across continental Europe – confronted an internal revolt against their own leaders.
The rise of Donald Trump – anti-trade, anti-migration, anti-Muslim, and nativist – is a reflection of an uncomfortable fact for the Republican establishment: the party’s median voter is closer to those who have lost from globalization.
A similar revolt took place in the UK’s Conservative Party, with globalization’s losers coalescing around the party’s “Leave” campaign or shifting allegiance to the populist anti-EU UK Independence Party.
In continental Europe, where multi-party parliamentary systems are prevalent, political fragmentation and disintegration are even more severe than in the UK and the US.
On the EU’s periphery, anti-establishment parties tend to be on the left: Syriza in Greece, Italy’s Five Star Movement, Spain’s Podemos, leftist parties in Portugal.
In the EU core, such parties tend to be on the right: Alternative for Germany, France’s National Front, and similar far-right parties in Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and elsewhere.
But, despite the growing number, organization, and mobilization of globalization’s losers, globalization itself is not necessarily doomed.
For starters, it continues to yield net benefits for advanced and emerging markets alike, which is why the losers still tend to be a minority in most advanced economies, while those who benefit from globalization are a large – if at times silent – majority.
In fact, even the “losers” benefit from the lower prices of goods and services brought about by globalization and technological innovation.
This also why populist and anti-establishment parties are still a political minority.
Even Syriza, once in power, backpedaled and had to accept austerity, as an EU exit would have been much costlier.
And Spain’s recent general election, held three days after the Brexit referendum, suggests that, despite high unemployment, austerity, and painful structural reforms, moderate, pro-European forces remain a majority.
Even in the US, Trump’s appeal is limited, owing to the demographic narrowness of his electoral base. Whether he can win the presidential election in November is highly doubtful.
This is also why pro-European center-right and center-left coalitions remain in power in most of the EU.
The risk that anti-EU parties may come to power in Italy, France, and the Netherlands – among others – is rising, but still remains a distant possibility.
Finally, economic theory suggests that globalization can be made to benefit all as long as the winners compensate the losers.
This can take the form of direct compensation or greater provision of free or semi-free public goods (for example, education, retraining, health care, unemployment benefits, and portable pensions).
For workers to accept more labor mobility and flexibility as creative destruction eliminates some jobs and creates others, appropriate schemes are needed to replace income lost as a result of transitional unemployment.
In the continental EU, establishment parties remain in power partly because their countries maintain extensive social welfare systems.
The backlash against globalization is real and growing. But it can be contained and managed through policies that compensate workers for its collateral damage and costs.
Only by enacting such policies will globalization’s losers begin to think that they may eventually join the ranks of its winners.
Globalization’s Assassin
The world’s first wave of economic globalization, led by the British Empire in the nineteenth century, came to an end literally with a bang on a Sunday afternoon in 1914, when Gavrilo Princip killed (with two uncannily well-aimed bullets) Austria’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife.
The years that followed witnessed pan-European carnage, instability throughout the 1920’s, and the rise of fascism and communism, culminating in the death of countless millions during World War II.
Is today’s globalizing era also coming to an end?
If so, it may not necessarily end with a repeat of the slaughters of the last century, but with an economic retrenchment that brings economic stagnation and consigns billions of people to grinding poverty.
Various candidates have been proposed for the role of globalization’s assassin.
But one little noticed, yet likely, aspirant has been sneaking up on the world economy: the growing tendency to limit the free circulation of people, to “fence in” the rich world.
We see the menace of this tendency constantly nowadays, but we perceive it in such a seemingly unthreatening way that we may well become accustomed to it rather than arresting it.
Globalization means free movement of capital, goods, technology, ideas, and, yes, people.
Any globalization that is limited to the first three or four freedoms but omits the last one is partial and not sustainable.
As soon as people cannot move, there will be little to stop governments from limiting the free movement of goods or other factors of production.
After all, if over-populated countries with high unemployment cannot export people, why not reach for higher tariff barriers to protect the jobs they have?
But what of the unemployed who become locked into their societies?
The war on terror has shown us the dangers that can arise from the social frustrations that often result.
Nevertheless, the “fencing-in” of the rich world continues apace.
The United States plans to construct a veritable “Mexican Wall” to keep poor people from crossing into Texas or California.
Likewise, hundreds, if not thousands, of Africans die every year trying to reach the shores of Fortress Europe.
Efforts to restrict people’s movement between countries expose the soft underbelly of globalization: the deepening gap between countries’ mean incomes.
Rather than poor countries growing faster than the rich (as we would expect from Economics 101), mainly the reverse is true.
Between 1980 and 2002, average annual per capita income growth in the rich world (defined as the “old” OECD members) was almost 2%, compared to just 0.1% in the 42 least developed countries.
Indeed, average income in Latin America is now barely above its 1980 level.
This huge gap spurs migration.
People nowadays know much more about conditions in different countries than they did in the past, and if moving across a border means that their income can be multiplied several-fold, they will try to do it.
This is why today’s most contentious borders separate economies where the income gaps between people on the two sides are the greatest.
There are four such global hot spots: the borders between the US and Mexico, Spain and Morocco, Greece (and Italy) and the southern Balkans, and Indonesia and Singapore (or Malaysia).
The income gaps range from more than seven to one in the latter case to 4.5 to one in the case of Spain and Morocco, 4.3 to one between the US and Mexico, and four to one between Greece and Albania.
Income differences were not always so huge.
In 1980, average income in the US was a little more than three times that of Mexico, the gap between Singapore and Indonesia was 5.3 to one, and the difference between Spain and Morocco 3.5 to one.
Even the gap between Greece and Albania, at three to one, was narrower than it is now.
So income gaps between all these contiguous countries have increased significantly during the last quarter-century.
So it is little wonder that it is in these places that most illegal immigration and human trafficking occurs – pirates in the Straits of Malacca, fast boats between Albania and Italy, and desperate human cargoes from Africa and Latin America.
If today’s globalization continues to widen income gaps, the waves of migration will grow.
So the rich world will, in a knee-jerk response, erect ever-higher barriers to stem the human tide.
If globalization, which has so enriched the world’s wealthiest countries, is to continue, governments must find ways to increase incomes more evenly.
Otherwise, today’s “fencing in” of the rich world will increase the risk of a backlash against free circulation of goods and capital, as well as of political instability punctuated by terrorism.
Global income redistribution by the rich countries should be viewed as a matter not of charity, but of enlightened self-interest.
Globalization’s Government
NEW YORK – We live in an era in which the most important forces affecting every economy are global, not local.
What happens “abroad” – in China, India, and elsewhere – powerfully affects even an economy as large as the United States.
Economic globalization has, of course, produced some large benefits for the world, including the rapid spread of advanced technologies such as the Internet and mobile telephony.
It has also reduced poverty sharply in many emerging economies – indeed, for this reason alone, the world economy needs to remain open and interconnected.
Yet globalization has also created major problems that need to be addressed.
First, it has increased the scope for tax evasion, owing to a rapid proliferation of tax havens around the world. Multinational companies have many more opportunities than before to dodge their fair and efficient share of taxation.
Moreover, globalization has created losers as well as winners.
In high-income countries, notably the US, Europe, and Japan, the biggest losers are workers who lack the education to compete effectively with low-paid workers in developing countries.
Hardest hit are workers in rich countries who lack a college education. Such workers have lost jobs by the millions.
Those who have kept their jobs have seen their wages stagnate or decline.
Globalization has also fueled contagion.
The 2008 financial crisis started on Wall Street, but quickly spread to the entire world, pointing to the need for global cooperation on banking and finance.
Climate change, infectious diseases, terrorism, and other ills that can easily cross borders demand a similar global response.
What globalization requires, therefore, are smart government policies.
Governments should promote high-quality education, to ensure that young people are prepared to face global competition.
They should raise productivity by building modern infrastructure and promoting science and technology. And governments should cooperate globally to regulate those parts of the economy – notably finance and the environment – in which problems in one country can spill over to other parts of the world.
The need for highly effective government in the era of globalization is the key message of my new book, The Price of Civilization.
Simply put, we need more government nowadays, not less.
Yet the role of government also needs to be modernized, in line with the specific challenges posed by an interconnected world economy.
I wrote The Price of Civilization out of the conviction that the US government has failed to understand and respond to the challenges of globalization ever since it began to impact America’s economy in the 1970’s.
Rather than respond to globalization with more government spending on education, infrastructure, and technology, Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980 by pledging to slash government spending and cut taxes.
For 30 years, the US has been going in the wrong direction, cutting the role of government in the domestic economy rather than promoting the investments needed to modernize the economy and workforce.
The rich have benefited in the short run, by getting massive tax breaks. The poor have suffered from job losses and cuts in government services.
Economic inequality has reached a high not seen since the Great Depression.
These adverse trends have been exacerbated by domestic politics. The rich have used their wealth to strengthen their grip on power.
They pay for the expensive campaigns of presidents and congressmen, so presidents and congressmen help the rich – often at the expense of the rest of society. The same syndrome – in which the rich have gained control of the political system (or strengthened their control of it) – now afflicts many other countries.
Yet there are some important signs around the world that people are fed up with governments that cater to the rich while ignoring everyone else.
Start with the growing calls for greater social justice.
The upheavals in Tunis and Cairo were first called the Arab Spring, because they seemed to be contained to the Arab world.
But then we saw protests in Tel Aviv, Santiago, London, and now even in the US.
These protests have called first and foremost for more inclusive politics, rather than the corrupt politics of oligarchy.
Moreover, US President Barack Obama is gradually shifting toward the left.
After three years in which his administration coddled corporate lobbyists, he has finally begun to emphasize the need for the rich to pay more taxes.
This has come late in his term, and he might well continue to favor the rich and Wall Street in exchange for campaign contributions in 2012, but there is a glimmer of hope that Obama will defend a fairer budget policy.
Several European governments, including Spain, Denmark, and Greece, also seem to be moving in the same direction.
Spain recently imposed a new wealth tax on high-net-worth taxpayers.
Denmark elected a center-left government committed to higher government spending financed by new taxes on the rich.
And Greece has just voted for a new property tax to help close its yawning fiscal deficit.
The European Commission has also called for a new Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) to raise around $75 billion per year.
The Commission has finally agreed that Europe’s financial sector has been under-taxed.
The new FTT might still face political opposition in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, with its large and influential banking sector, but at least the principle of greater tax fairness is high on the European agenda.
The world’s most successful economies today are in Scandinavia.
By using high taxes to finance a high level of government services, these countries have balanced high prosperity with social justice and environmental sustainability.
This is the key to well-being in today’s globalized economy.
Perhaps more parts of the world – and especially the world’s young people – are beginning to recognize this new reality.
Does Trade Fuel Inequality?
CAMBRIDGE – Inequality has become a major political preoccupation in the advanced economies – and for good reason.
In the United States, according to the recently released World Inequality Report 2018, the share of national income claimed by the top 1% of the population rose from 11% in 1980 to 20% in 2014, compared to just 13% for the entire bottom half of the population.
Qualitatively similar, though less pronounced, trends characterize other major countries such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
To explain the rise in inequality that began in the 1980s and has accelerated since the turn of the century, many have pointed out that indicators of globalization, such as the trade-to-GDP ratio, have also risen since 1980.
But does that correlation imply a causal link between trade and inequality?
There are certainly reasons to doubt it.
The global trade-to-GDP ratio peaked in 2008 at 61%, after a 35-year climb, falling back to 56% by 2016 – at precisely the time when fear of globalization reached political fever pitch.
What if we look at the world as a whole, rather than individual countries?
As Columbia’s Xavier Sala-i-Martin pointed out in 2002 and 2006, even as inequality has risen in nearly every country, inequality across countries has decreased, owing largely to the success of developing countries like China and India in raising their per capita incomes since the 1980s.
Multiple factors, including urbanization, high savings rates, and improved access to education, undoubtedly underlie these countries’ impressive performance.
But, if one uses geography to isolate exogenous determinants of trade, it becomes apparent that trade has been among the most powerful drivers of Asia’s economic success, and thus the convergence between the developed and developing worlds.
For someone like US President Donald Trump, this would indicate that Asia’s success has come at America’s expense.
This view of trade as a zero-sum game was a feature of the mercantilist theory that reigned three centuries ago, before Adam Smith and David Ricardo made the case that trade would normally benefit both partners, by enabling each to take advantage of their comparative advantages.
But the Smith-Ricardo theory has a key limitation: it does not distinguish among a country’s citizens, and therefore cannot address the question of income distribution within a country.
Given this, the Heckscher-Ohlin-Stolper-Samuelson model may be more useful, as it distinguishes between workers and owners of physical, financial, or human (skills) capital.
The HO-SS theory, which dominated international economic thinking from the 1950s through 1970s, predicted that international trade would benefit the abundant factor of production (in rich countries, the owners of capital) and hurt the scarce factor of production (in rich countries, unskilled labor).
Workers could command higher wages if they did not have to compete against abundant labor in poorer countries.
Then came the post-1980 revolutions in trade theory.
Paul Krugman and Elhanan Helpman introduced the previously neglected elements of imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale.
Later, in 2003, Marc Melitz showed how trade could shift resources from low-productivity to high-productivity firms.
Critics of globalization latched onto these newer economic theories, claiming that they demanded a rethinking of the traditional case for free trade.
It was precisely at that time, however, that the HO-SS trade theory’s prediction that free trade would hurt lower-skill workers in rich countries apparently began to materialize.
Yet not all of the HO-SS theory’s predictions have come true.
As Pinelopi Goldberg and Nina Pavcnik reported in 2007, the expectation that trade would reduce inequality in the countries with the most unskilled workers, because their services are in greater demand in an integrated world market, has not been borne out.
“There is overwhelming evidence,” they write, “that less-skilled workers in developing countries “are generally not better off, at least not relative to workers with higher skill or education levels.”
In the same year, Branko Milanović and Lyn Squire also found that tariff reduction is associated with higher inequality in poor countries.
Ten years later, inequality continues to worsen within developing countries, including the so-called BRICS emerging economies.
In Brazil, the top 1% accounts for 25% of national income.
In Russia, the income share of the top 1% of the population increased from 4% in 1980 to 20% in 2015.
Likewise, in India, that figure rose from 6% in 1982 to 22% in 2013.
In China, it surged from 6% in 1978 to 14% in 2015.
And, in South Africa, it rose from 9% in 1987 to 19% in 2012.
A look at the top 10% of earners shows similar trends.
This does not mean that the forces described by the HO-SS theory are irrelevant. But there is clearly more to current inequality trends than trade.
Technological progress – which has raised demand for skilled workers relative to unskilled workers, at a time when the supply of skilled graduates lags – seems to be a major factor everywhere.
The growing tendency of many professions to produce winner-take-all outcomes may play a role as well.
A lack of redistribution through taxes in a country like the US (compared to major countries in Europe) does not help matters.
Inequality is clearly a serious problem that merits political attention. But focusing on trade is not the way to resolve it.
World Order 2.0
NEW YORK – For nearly four centuries, since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 ended the Thirty Years’ War in Europe, the concept of sovereignty – the right of countries to an independent existence and autonomy – has formed the core of the international order.
And for good reason: as we have seen in century after century, including the current one, a world in which borders are forcibly violated is a world of instability and conflict.
But, in a globalized world, a global operating system premised solely on respect for sovereignty – call it World Order 1.0 – has become increasingly inadequate.
Little stays local anymore.
Just about anyone and anything, from tourists, terrorists, and refugees to e-mails, diseases, dollars, and greenhouse gases, can reach almost anywhere.
The result is that what goes on inside a country can no longer be the concern of that country alone.
Today’s realities call for an updated operating system—World Order 2.0 – based on “sovereign obligation,” the notion that sovereign states have not just rights but also obligations to others.
A new international order will also require an expanded set of norms and arrangements, beginning with an agreed-upon basis for statehood.
Existing governments would agree to consider bids for statehood only in cases where there was a historical justification, a compelling rationale, and popular support, and where the proposed new entity is viable.
World Order 2.0 must also include prohibitions on carrying out or in any way supporting terrorism.
More controversially, it must include strengthened norms proscribing the spread or use of weapons of mass destruction.
As it stands, while the world tends to agree on constraining proliferation by limiting countries’ access to the relevant technology and material, the consensus often breaks down once proliferation has occurred.
This should become a topic of discussion at bilateral and multilateral meetings, not because it would lead to a formal agreement, but because it would focus attention on applying stringent sanctions or undertaking military action, which could then reduce the odds of proliferation.
Another essential element of a new international order is cooperation on climate change, which may be the quintessential manifestation of globalization, because all countries are exposed to its effects, regardless of their contribution to it.
The 2015 Paris climate agreement – in which governments agreed to limit their emissions and to provide resources to help poorer countries adapt – was a step in the right direction.
Progress on this front must continue.
Cyberspace is the newest domain of international activity characterized by both cooperation and conflict.
The goal in this area should be to create international arrangements that encourage benign uses of cyberspace and discourage malign uses.
Governments would have to act consistently within this regime as part of their sovereign obligations – or face sanctions or retaliation.
Global health presents a different set of challenges.
In a globalized world, an outbreak of infectious disease in one country could quickly evolve into a serious threat to health elsewhere, as has happened in recent years with SARS, Ebola, and Zika.
Fortunately, the notion of sovereign obligation is already advanced in this sphere: countries are responsible for trying to detect infectious disease outbreaks, responding appropriately, and notifying others around the world.
When it comes to refugees, there is no substitute for effective local action aimed at preventing situations that generate large refugee flows in the first place.
In principle, this is an argument for humanitarian intervention in selective situations.
But translating this principle into practice will remain difficult, given divergent political agendas and the high costs of effective intervention.
Even without a consensus, however, there is a strong case for increasing funding for refugees, ensuring their humane treatment, and setting fair quotas for their resettlement.
Trade agreements are, by definition, pacts of reciprocal sovereign obligations regarding tariff and nontariff barriers.
When a party believes that obligations are not being met, it has recourse to arbitration through the World Trade Organization.
But things are less clear when it comes to government subsidies or currency manipulation.
The challenge, therefore, is to define appropriate sovereign obligations in these areas in future trade pacts, and to create mechanisms to hold governments accountable.
Establishing the concept of sovereign obligations as a pillar of the international order will take decades of consultations and negotiations – and even then, its acceptance and impact will be uneven.
Progress will come only voluntarily, from countries themselves, rather than from any top-down edict.
Realistically, it will be difficult to forge agreement on what specific sovereign obligations states have and how they should be enforced.
Complicating matters further, US President Donald Trump’s administration has espoused an “America first” doctrine that is largely inconsistent with what is being suggested here.
If this remains the US approach, progress toward building the sort of order that today’s interconnected world demands will come about only if other major powers push it – or it will have to wait for Trump’s successor.
Such an approach, however, would be second best, and it would leave the United States and the rest of the world worse off.
Now is the time to begin the necessary conversations.
Globalization is here to stay.
Moving toward a new international order that incorporates sovereign obligation is the best way to cope.
World Order 2.0, predicated on sovereign obligation, is certainly an ambitious project – but one born of realism, not idealism.
Globalizing NATO
PRINCETON – Next week, NATO’s 28 members will meet in Chicago for their annual summit.
Sixty-two years after the North Atlantic Treaty was signed, binding the United States, Canada, and ten European states to consider an attack on one an attack on all, NATO is transforming itself into a twenty-first-century global security organization.
The result will be a safer world.
In 1949, the world was rapidly dividing into two principle political-military blocs, East and West, alongside a large “non-aligned movement.”
NATO faced off against the Warsaw Pact, created by the Soviet Union and its allies in 1955.
Within both blocs, smaller powers clustered around the superpower.
No flexibility existed within either bloc for smaller groups of members to deploy alliance assets.
Today, NATO is becoming, in the words of its secretary-general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, “a hub of a network of security partnerships and a center for consultation on global security issues.”
It is a “globally connected institution,” with more than 40 individual country partners and growing ties to other international organizations.
Indeed, the country partners include all of Europe’s non-NATO countries, such as Austria, Switzerland, Finland, and Sweden, and aspiring and possible NATO members such as Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Ukraine, Belarus, and even Russia.
Virtually all of the Central Asian countries – from Turkmenistan to Kazakhstan, as well as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – are partners, as is the entire Maghreb, from Morocco to Egypt, as well as Israel, Jordan, Iraq, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.
Finally, Pacific partners include Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and Mongolia.
On the organizational side, NATO describes itself as having developed “close working relations” with the United Nations, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
It also collaborates regularly with the African Union, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Organization for Migration, the World Bank, the International Civil Aviation Organization, and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
If one draws links radiating outward from NATO to all of these different countries and organizations, the result is a security network that has multiple hubs and clusters – much like a map of the Internet or of planets and galaxies.
This world is no longer unipolar, bipolar, or even multipolar, because the actors that matter are not single states but groups of states that are more or less densely connected.
It is a multi-hub security network, in which the hubs are regional organizations of different sizes and strengths.
This structural shift has enormous practical significance.
For starters, it means that not only NATO’s military resources, but also its human capital and practical knowledge in combating many different kinds of threats are available globally.
NATO has created a Comprehensive Crisis and Operations Management Center that brings together civilian and military expertise on crisis identification, planning, operations, reconstruction, and stabilization capabilities in ways that are explicitly designed to connect NATO headquarters in Europe to “the networked world.”
Second, NATO’s own identity is becoming that of an alliance that exists to empower – to offer assistance and partnership – as much as to overpower.
NATO is no longer just a hammer; it is an entire toolbox of security options.
These options include developing counter-networks to meet networked security threats such as terrorism and proliferation of nuclear, chemical, or biological materials, as well as highly decentralized threats such as piracy.
As a result, when a crisis like the war in East Timor in 1999 or last year’s political stalemate in Côte d’Ivoire arises, NATO can backstop whichever country or group of countries chooses to take the lead in carrying out a UN mandate.
NATO members themselves also have much more flexibility to draw on NATO’s collective assets.
Even skeptics of NATO expansion and operations like the intervention in Libya now recognize that joint operations by member countries, operating under a UN mandate and in conjunction with regional partners, is likely to be a model for the future.
As General Brent Scowcroft, National Security Adviser for President George H.W. Bush, observed recently, the UN Charter originally envisioned a standing military force to enforce Security Council resolutions – a vision that the NATO partner model might ultimately realize.
Power in a network flows from connectedness, or what network theorists call “centrality.”
The most powerful member of a network is the node that has the most connections to others, which means that a node can increase its power not only by adding connections directly, but also by increasing the connectedness of nearby nodes.
In other words, the US can increase its own power both by connecting to other NATO members (and then ensuring that NATO is connected to as many other countries and organizations as possible) and by increasing the connectedness of those other countries and organizations.
If NATO connects with the African Union, for example, and increases the AU’s connectedness, then both NATO and the AU become more central to the network and hence more powerful in terms of their ability to exercise influence and marshal resources.
The logic of centrality as a source of power creates a virtuous circle, in which members of a network gain advantage by bringing more members into the network and connecting more densely to them.
That is exactly the logic behind NATO’s transformation.
The immediate topic on the agenda in Chicago next week will be getting NATO forces out of Afghanistan.
But the longer-term subject will be getting as many countries as possible into the global NATO security network.
Who Will Fill America’s Shoes?
NEW YORK – It is increasingly clear that US President Donald Trump represents a departure when it comes to America’s global outlook and behavior.
As a result, the United States will no longer play the leading international role that has defined its foreign policy for three quarters of a century, under Democratic and Republican presidents alike.
We have already seen many examples of this change.
The traditional US commitment to global organizations has been superseded by the idea of “America first.”
Alliances and security guarantees once regarded as a given are increasingly conditioned on how much allies spend on defense and whether they are seen to derive unfair advantage from trade with the US.
More broadly, foreign trade is viewed with suspicion – supposedly a source of job loss rather than an engine of investment, job creation, growth, and stability.
Immigration and refugee policies have become more restrictive.
Less emphasis is being placed on promoting democracy and human rights.
More dollars are going to defense, but fewer resources are being devoted to supporting global health or development.
This is not to be confused with isolationism.
Even Trump’s America will continue to play a meaningful role in the world.
It is using military force in the Middle East and Afghanistan, increasing diplomatic pressure on North Korea to rein in its nuclear and missile programs, and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.
And the policies of states, cities, and companies will translate into an American commitment to climate change, despite Trump’s decision to abandon the Paris agreement.
Still, a shift away from a US-dominated world of structured relationships and standing institutions and toward something else is under way.
What this alternative will be, however, remains largely unknowable.
What we do know is that there is no alternative great power willing and able to step in and assume what had been the US role.
China is a frequently mentioned candidate, but its leadership is focused mostly on consolidating domestic order and maintaining artificially high economic-growth rates to stave off popular unrest.
China’s interest in regional and global institutions seems designed mostly to bolster its economy and geopolitical influence, rather than to help set rules and create broadly beneficial arrangements.
Likewise, Russia is a country with a narrowly-based economy led by a government focused on retaining power at home and re-establishing Russian influence in the Middle East and Europe.
India is preoccupied with the challenge of economic development and is tied down by its problematic relationship with Pakistan.
Japan is held back by its declining population, domestic political and economic constraints, and its neighbors’ suspicions.
Europe, for its part, is distracted by questions surrounding the relationship between member states and the European Union.
As a result, the whole of the continent is less than the sum of its parts – none of which is large enough to succeed America on the world stage.
But the absence of a single successor to the US does not mean that what awaits is chaos.
At least in principle, the world’s most powerful countries could come together to fill America’s shoes.
In practice, though, this will not happen, as these countries lack the capabilities, experience, and, above all, a consensus on what needs doing and who needs to do it.
A more likely development is the emergence of a mix of order and disorder at both the regional and global level.
China will promote various trade, infrastructure, and security mechanisms in Asia.
The 11 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership may launch their trade pact without the US.
Less clear is whether China is prepared to use its influence to restrain North Korea, how India and Pakistan will avoid conflict, and the resolution of Asia’s many territorial disputes.
It is all too easy to imagine an Asian and Pacific future characterized by higher spending on arms of all types – and thus more susceptible to violent conflict.
The Middle East is already suffering unprecedented instability, the result of local rivalries and realities, and of 15 years during which the US arguably first did too much and then too little to shape the region’s future.
The immediate danger is not just further deterioration in failed states such as Yemen, Syria, and Libya, but also direct conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Europe may be something of an exception to such trends, as the election of President Emmanuel Macron in France has given rise to a government that is committed to reforming the EU.
But the EU itself faces an uncertain future, given Brexit and slow-motion crises in Italy and Greece, not to mention the potential for additional Russian mischief or worse.
To all of this, one could add the meltdown in Venezuela and the all-too-familiar horrors in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
And then there is the growing gap between global challenges such as how to govern cyberspace, and the willingness of governments to work together to address them.
There is no little irony in this global turn of events.
For decades, many countries criticized US policy, both for what it was and what it was not.
These same countries now face the prospect of a world in which American leadership is likely to be less of a factor.
It is far from clear that they are prepared for such a world, or that they will find themselves better off in it.
Global Macroeconomic Cooperation
NEW YORK – The world has yet to achieve the macroeconomic policy coordination that will be needed to restore economic growth following the Great Crash of 2008.
In much of the world, consumers are now cutting their spending in response to a fall in their wealth and a fear of unemployment.
The overwhelming force behind the current collapse of jobs, output, and trade flows, is even more important than the financial panic that followed Lehman Brothers’ default in September 2008.
There is, of course, no return to the situation that preceded the Great Crash.
The worldwide financial bubble cannot and should not be recreated.
But if the world cooperates effectively, the decline in consumer demand can be offset by a valuable increase in investment spending to address the most critical needs on the planet: sustainable energy, safe water and sanitation, a reduction of pollution, improved public health, and increased food production for the poor.
The United States, Europe, and Asia have all experienced a collapse of wealth due to the fall of stock markets and housing prices.
There is not yet an authoritative measurement of the wealth decline and of how it is distributed worldwide, but it is probably around $15 trillion lower than the peak in the US, and perhaps $10 trillion lower in both Europe and Asia.
A combined wealth decline of around $25 trillion would be roughly 60% of one year’s global income.
The decline in US wealth as a share of the US economy is even larger, around 100% of annual income, and perhaps 70% of annual income in Europe and Asia.
The usual assumption is that household consumption falls by around $0.05 for each $1 decline in household wealth.
This would mean a direct negative shock to household spending in the US of around 5% of national income, and of around 3.5% in Europe and Asia.
The size of this downturn is so large that unemployment will rise sharply in all major regions of the world economy, perhaps reaching 9-10% in the US.
Households will gradually save enough to restore their wealth, and household consumption will gradually recover as well.
Yet this will occur too slowly to prevent a rapid rise in unemployment and a massive shortfall of production relative to potential output.
The world therefore needs to stimulate other kinds of spending.
One powerful way to boost the world economy and to help meet future needs is to increase spending on key infrastructure projects, mainly directed at transportation (roads, ports, rail, and mass transit), sustainable energy (wind, solar, geothermal, carbon-capture and sequestration, and long-distance power transmission grids), pollution control, and water and sanitation.
There is a strong case for global cooperation to increase these public investments in the developing economies, and especially in the world’s poorest regions.
These regions, including Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia, are suffering harshly from the global crisis, owing to falling export earnings, remittances, and capital inflows.
Poor regions are also suffering from climate changes such as more frequent droughts, caused by rich countries’ greenhouse-gas emissions.
At the same time, impoverished countries have huge needs for infrastructure, especially roads, rail, renewable energy, water and sanitation, and for improved current delivery of vital life-saving services, including health care and support for food production.
The G-20, which comprises the world’s largest economies, offers the natural setting for global policy coordination.
The next G-20 meeting in London in early April is a crucial opportunity for timely action.
The leading economies – especially the US, European Union, and Japan – should establish new programs to finance infrastructure investments in low-income countries.
The new lending should be at least $100 billion per year, directed towards developing countries.
The new financing would include direct loans from rich countries’ export-credit agencies to enable poor countries to borrow long term (for example, 40 years) to build roads, power grids, renewable energy generation, ports, fiber optic networks, and water and sanitation systems.
The G-20 should also increase the lending capacity of the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and other international financial institutions.
Japan, with a surplus of saving, a strong currency, massive foreign exchange reserves, and factories without domestic orders, should take the lead in providing this funding for infrastructure.
Moreover, Japan can boost its own economy and those of the poorest countries by directing its own industrial production to the infrastructure needs of the developing world.
Cooperation can turn the sharp and frightening decline in worldwide consumption spending into a global opportunity to invest more in the world’s future well being.
By directing resources away from rich countries’ consumption to developing countries’ investment needs, the world can achieve a “triple” victory.
Higher investment and social spending in poor countries will stimulate the entire world economy, spur economic development, and promote environmental sustainability through investments in renewable energy, efficient water use, and sustainable agriculture.
Global Malaise in 2006?
The almighty American consumer had another banner year in 2005, helping sustain global economic growth, albeit at a slower pace than in 2004.
As in recent years, he consumed at or above his income level, and the United States as a whole spent well beyond its means, borrowing from the rest of the world at a feverish pace in 2005 – more than $2 billion a day.
A year ago, most pundits argued that this was unsustainable.
It evidently was sustainable, at least for one more year.
But it nonetheless remains true that whatever is unsustainable will not be sustained, which creates great risks for the US and global economy in 2006.
Two economic surprises prolonged the good times in 2005.
First, while the US Federal Reserve continued hiking short-term interest rates, long-terms rates did not increase in tandem, which allowed housing prices to continue rising.
This was centrally important to sustaining global growth, for the performance of world’s largest economy has been fueled by real estate in recent years, with individuals refinancing their mortgages and spending some of the proceeds, and with high prices leading to more construction.
But this is unlikely to continue.
Long-term interest rates almost certainly will eventually start to rise – and “eventually” increasingly looks like next year.
If so, Americans will have to spend more money on debt service, leaving them with less to spend on consumption of goods and services.
Moreover, real estate prices will most likely stop rising rapidly – indeed, they may even decline.
As a result, refinancing of mortgages will grind to a halt, leaving no money to draw out of housing to sustain Americans’ consumption binge.
On both accounts, aggregate demand will decline.
Is it possible that the cash-rich corporate sector will more than make up for the slack by increasing investment?
There may well be some increase in gross investment, as obsolete equipment and software are replaced. But there also is some evidence that innovation is slowing – perhaps the result of reduced investment in research in the past five years.
In any case, even if firms are cash-rich, they do not typically expand investment during periods when consumption is slowing.
Uncertainties about the economy are likely to insert an element of caution into companies’ investment decisions.
In short, it is more likely that moderating investment will exacerbate the consumer slowdown than that an acceleration of investment will offset it.
But this is not the only reason for bleaker prospects for America and the world in 2006.
The second surprise in 2005 was that while oil prices increased far more than expected, the economic dampening effect seemed somewhat muted in most places, at least until the last part of the year.
Because of higher oil prices, for example, America’s spending on oil imports has increased by roughly $50 billion a year – money that otherwise would have been spent mostly on goods made in America.
For most of 2005, Americans behaved as if they didn’t really believe that oil prices would remain high, at least for a while.
This is less startling than it may appear: econometric studies suggest that it takes a year to two before the full effects of oil-price increases are felt.
Now, with futures markets predicting that oil will be $50 to $60 a barrel for the next two years, demand for gas-guzzlers has evaporated, taking with it the prospects for America’s auto companies, whose corporate strategies have bet on low oil prices and America’s love affair with the SUV.
High oil prices are set to dampen economic performance in the rest of the world as well, although growth prospects look better than in the US.
China’s growth continues to astound the world; indeed, new GDP data suggest that its economy is 20% larger than previously thought.
Moreover, China’s surging growth will echo throughout much of Asia, including (in somewhat muted form) in Japan.
Europe continues to be a mixed picture, with the European Central Bank almost perversely raising interest rates even as Europe’s economy needs further stimulation to ensure its recovery.
As if that were not bad enough, Germany’s new government is promising to raise taxes.
Fiscal rectitude in the right place and the right time is to be commended; but this is the wrong place and the wrong time – and Germany’s recovery prospects will be dampened.
The main risk in 2006 is that America’s long-brewing problems come to a head globally: investors, finally taking heed of the large structural fiscal deficit, the yawning trade gap, and the high level of household indebtedness, may pull money out of the US in a panic.
Alternatively, rising interest rates and a downturn in the real estate market could so weaken consumer demand that the economy slips into recession, squeezing exporters in other countries that depend on the US market.
In either case, the US government, hamstrung by already-wide deficits, may feel powerless to respond with countercyclical fiscal policy.
With confidence in Bush’s economic management almost as low as confidence in his management of the Iraq war, there is every reason to worry that should one of these crises emerge, it will not be well managed.
But it is more likely that 2006 will just be another year of malaise: China’s significance within the global economy is still not large enough to offset weaknesses in the rest of the world.
America, too, will manage to muddle through again – leaving even higher levels of debt for the future.
In short, 2006 will be marked by mounting uncertainty about prospects for global economic growth, even as the distribution of the fruits of that growth remain dismally predictable.
In America, at least, 2006 is likely to be another year in which stagnant real wages freeze, or even erode, the living standards of those in the middle.
And, everywhere, it is likely to be another year in which the gap between the haves and the have-nots will widen.
A Global Marshall Plan
ROME – Despite ongoing efforts to catalyze global development cooperation, there have been significant obstacles to progress in recent years.
Fortunately, with major international meetings set for the second half of 2015, world leaders have an important opportunity to overcome them.
Such a turnaround has happened before.
At the turn of the century, international negotiations on economic development had also come to a grinding halt.
The Seattle ministerial of the World Trade Organization ended without decision, and after two decades of the Washington Consensus, developing countries were frustrated at the US-led international financial institutions.
Negotiations for the inaugural United Nations Financing for Development (FfD) conference in Monterrey, Mexico, seemed to be headed nowhere.
Then, on September 11, 2001, the United States was hit with major terrorist attacks – a tragic development that somehow catalyzed progress.
World leaders agreed to begin the Doha Development Round to ensure that trade negotiations would serve developing countries’ development aspirations.
And the 2002 Monterrey FfD conference produced major breakthroughs on foreign and domestic investment, foreign debt, international cooperation, trade, and systemic governance issues.
Of course, tragedy is not needed to kick-start progress.
This year’s major global meetings – the Conference on Financing for Development in July, the meeting at the United Nations to adopt Sustainable Development Goals in September, and the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December – should be sufficient.
And the efforts that have gone into preparing for these meetings suggest that there is a will to move forward.
But the right program is key.
The world needs a well-designed and far-reaching strategy to stimulate industrialization, modeled after the European Recovery Program – the American initiative that enabled Europe to rebuild after World War II.
The Marshall Plan, as it is better known, entailed a massive infusion of US aid to support national development efforts in Europe, and is still viewed by many Europeans as America’s finest hour.
The Marshall Plan’s impact was felt far beyond Europe’s borders, developing over the following decade into what is probably the most successful economic-development assistance project in human history.
Similar policies were introduced in Northeast Asia following the establishment of the People’s Republic of China and the Korean War.
Of course, there was a political motivation behind the Marshall Plan’s expansion.
By creating a cordon sanitaire of wealthy countries from Western Europe to Northeast Asia, the US hoped to contain the spread of communism at the start of the Cold War.
Developing countries that did not serve the same political ends were left out.
At its core, however, the Marshall Plan was an economic strategy – and a sound one at that.
Crucially, it represented a complete reversal of its predecessor, the Morgenthau Plan, which focused on de-industrialization – with poor results.
The plan’s aim – articulated by Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr., in his 1945 book Germany is Our Problem – was to convert Germany into a “principally agricultural and pastoral” country, in order to prevent its involvement in any new wars.
By late 1946, however, economic hardship and unemployment in Germany spurred former US President Herbert Hoover to visit the country on a fact-finding mission.
Hoover’s third report of March 18, 1947, called the notion that Germany could be reduced to a pastoral state an “illusion,” which could not be achieved without exterminating or moving 25,000,000 people out of the country.
The only alternative was re-industrialization.
Less than three months later, Secretary of State George Marshall made his landmark speech at Harvard University announcing the policy reversal.
Germany and the rest of Europe were to be re-industrialized, he stated, including through heavy-handed state interventions, such as high duties, quotas, and import prohibitions.
Free trade would be possible only after reconstruction, when European countries could compete in international markets.
Marshall made three other important points in his short speech.
First, in noting the role that the breakdown of trade between urban and rural areas played in Germany’s economic slowdown, he recalled a centuries-old European economic insight: all wealthy countries have cities with a manufacturing sector.
“The remedy,” Marshall explained, “lies in…restoring the confidence of the European people,” so that “the manufacturer and the farmer” would be “able and willing to exchange their products for currencies, the continuing value of which is not open to question.”
Second, Marshall argued that participatory institutions emerge from economic progress, not the other way around – the opposite of today’s conventional wisdom.
As he put it, the policy’s “purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world, so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.”
Third, Marshall emphasized that aid should be comprehensive and strategic, in order to foster real progress and development.
“Such assistance,” he declared, “must not be on a piecemeal basis as various crises develop.
Any assistance that this government may render in the future should provide a cure, rather than a mere palliative.”
Marshall’s vision offers important lessons for world leaders seeking to accelerate development today, beginning with the need to reverse the effects of the Washington Consensus on developing and transition economies – effects that resemble those of the Morgenthau Plan.
Some countries – including large economies like China and India, which have long protected domestic industry – have been in a better position to benefit from economic globalization.
Others have experienced a decline in economic growth and real per capita income, as their industry and agricultural capacity have fallen, especially over the last two decades of the last century.
It is time to increase poor economies’ productive capacity and purchasing power, as occurred in Europe in the decade after Marshall’s speech.
Marshall’s insight that such shared economic development is the only way to create a lasting peace remains as true as ever.
A Normative Approach to Preventing Cyberwarfare
CAMBRIDGE – A series of episodes in recent years – including Russia’s cyber interventions to skew the United States’ 2016 presidential election toward Donald Trump, the anonymous cyber-attacks that disrupted Ukraine’s electricity system in 2015, and the “Stuxnet” virus that destroyed a thousand Iranian centrifuges – has fueled growing concern about conflict in cyberspace.
At last month’s Munich Security Conference, Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders announced the formation of a new non-governmental Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace to supplement the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE).
The GGE’s reports in 2010, 2013, and 2015 helped to set the negotiating agenda for cybersecurity, and the most recent identified a set of norms that have been endorsed by the UN General Assembly.
But, despite this initial success, the GGE has limitations.
The participants are technically advisers to the UN Secretary-General rather than fully empowered national negotiators.
Although the number of participants has increased from the original 15 to 25, most countries do not have a voice.
But there is a larger question lurking behind the GGE: Can norms really limit state behavior?
Most experts agree that a global cyberspace treaty currently would be politically impossible (though Russia and China have made such proposals at the UN).
But, beyond formal treaties, normative constraints on states also include codes of conduct, conventional state practices, and widely shared expectations of proper behavior among a group (which create a common law).
In scope, these constraints can vary from global, to plurilateral, to bilateral.
So what can history tell us about the effectiveness of normative policy instruments?
In the decade after Hiroshima, tactical nuclear weapons were widely regarded as “normal” weapons, and the US military incorporated nuclear artillery, atomic land mines, and nuclear anti-aircraft weapons into its deployed forces.
In 1954 and 1955, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told President Dwight Eisenhower that the defense of Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam and of offshore islands near Taiwan would require the use of nuclear weapons (Eisenhower rejected the advice).
Over time, the development of an informal norm of non-use of nuclear weapons changed this.
The Nobel laureate economist Thomas Schelling argued that the development of the norm of non-use of nuclear weapons was one of the most important aspects of arms control over the past 70 years, and it has had an inhibiting effect on decision-makers.
But for new nuclear states like North Korea, one cannot be sure that the costs of violating the taboo would be perceived as outweighing the benefits.
Similarly, a taboo against using poisonous gases in warfare developed after World War I, and the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibited the use of chemical and biological weapons.
Two treaties in the 1970s prohibited the production and stockpiling of such weapons, creating a cost not only for their use, but also for their very possession.
Verification provisions for the Biological Weapons Convention are weak (merely reporting to the UN Security Council), and such taboos did not prevent the Soviet Union from continuing to possess and develop biological weapons in the 1970s.
Similarly, the Chemical Weapons Convention did not stop either Saddam Hussein or Bashar al-Assad from using chemical weapons against their own citizens.
Nonetheless, both treaties have shaped how others perceive such actions.
Such perceptions contributed to the justification of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and to the international dismantling of most Syrian weapons in 2014.
With 173 countries having ratified the Biological Warfare Convention, states that wish to develop such weapons must do so secretly, and face widespread international condemnation if evidence of their activities becomes known.
Normative taboos may also become relevant in the cyber realm, though here the difference between a weapon and a non-weapon depends on intent, and it would be difficult to forbid – and impossible to prohibit reliably – the design, possession, or even implantation for espionage of particular computer programs.
In that sense, efforts to prevent cyber conflict cannot be like the nuclear arms control that developed during the Cold War, which involved elaborate treaties and detailed verification protocols.
A more fruitful approach to normative controls on cyberwarfare may be to establish a taboo not against weapons but against targets.
The US has promoted the view that the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), which prohibit deliberate attacks on civilians, applies in cyberspace.
Accordingly, the US has proposed that, rather than pledging “no first use” of cyber weapons, countries should pledge not to use cyber weapons against civilian facilities in peacetime.
This approach to norms has been adopted by the GGE.
The taboo would be reinforced by confidence-building measures such as promises of forensic assistance and non-interference with the workings of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs).
The GGE report of July 2015 focused on restraining attacks on certain civilian targets, rather than proscribing particular code.
At the September 2015 summit between US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the two leaders agreed to establish an expert commission to study the GGE proposal.
Subsequently, the GGE report was endorsed by the leaders of the G20 and referred to the UN General Assembly.
The attack on the Ukrainian power system occurred in December 2015, shortly after the submission of the GGE report, and in 2016, Russia did not treat the US election process as protected civilian infrastructure.
The development of normative controls on cyber weapons remains a slow – and, at this point, incomplete – process.
The Global Obesity Threat
LONDON/MELBOURNE – In 2010, humanity passed an important milestone.
According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, published in the British medical journal The Lancet, obesity became a bigger public-health problem than hunger.
Today, according to the latest edition of the study, more than 2.1 billion people – nearly 30% of the global population – are overweight or obese.
That is nearly two and a half times the number of adults and children who are undernourished.
Obesity is responsible for about 5% of deaths worldwide.
This crisis is not just a pressing health concern; it is also a threat to the global economy.
The total economic impact of obesity is about $2 trillion a year, or 2.8% of world GDP – roughly equivalent to the economic damage caused by smoking or armed violence, war, and terrorism, according to new research by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI).
And the problem is likely to worsen.
If the current trend continues, almost half of the world’s adult population will be overweight or obese by 2030.
As World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Margaret Chan has noted, “Not one single country has managed to turn around its obesity epidemic in all age groups.”
According to the OECD, from 2000 to 2013, the prevalence of obesity increased by at least 0.5% per year in 130 of the 196 countries for which data were collected.
This global epidemic is not confined to advanced countries.
As emerging economies climb out of poverty, their citizens are becoming fatter.
More than 60% of the world’s obese people live in developing countries, where rapid industrialization and urbanization are boosting incomes and therefore calorie intake.
In India and China, the prevalence of obesity in cities is 3-4 times the rate in rural areas.
Indeed, the evidence suggests that developing countries are especially vulnerable to the epidemic.
Obesity rates tend to explode in countries where food was once scarce and suddenly becomes plentiful.
In the mid-twentieth century, for example, a boom in phosphate mining transformed the Micronesian island state of Nauru from a land of food shortages and starvation to the world’s leader in obesity and type-2 diabetes.
In 2005, according to the WHO, 94% of men and 93% of women in Nauru were overweight, and more than 70% of the population was obese.
To make matters worse, in countries with limited public-health services, the cost of health care falls directly on the afflicted households.
As a result, obesity can lock in poverty and perpetuate inequality.
Through a review of 500 intervention trials around the world, MGI has identified 74 potential interventions that could be used to address obesity.
These include subsidized school meals, urban design that encourages walking, better nutritional labeling, restrictions on the advertising of high-calorie food and drinks, and fiscal measures.
Education concerning the risks of obesity is important, as is taking personal responsibility for one’s health, fitness, and weight.
But all the evidence shows that relying on knowledge about obesity and willpower is not enough to offset the evolutionary instinct to overeat.
These effects are compounded by lifestyles that require little or no physical activity.
People need help, and that means changing the environmental forces shaping their decisions – by, say, reducing standard portion sizes, altering marketing practices, and designing cities and educational establishments to make it easier for people to exercise or be active.
MGI was able to collect enough data on 44 of the 74 potential interventions to develop an initial assessment of their impact if they were scaled up to a national level.
If the United Kingdom, for example, were to deploy all 44 interventions, it could rein in obesity rates and help roughly 20% of its overweight and obese population return to a healthy weight within 5-10 years.
Over the long term, savings from reduced health-care spending and gains from higher productivity could outweigh the investment needed to deliver interventions.
In the UK, reversing obesity trends could save the National Health Service about $1.2 billion a year.
For many countries, tackling obesity will require a national – if not global – effort.
Only a coherent, sustained portfolio of initiatives, implemented on a large scale, will be effective.
No single entity – government, retailers, consumer-goods companies, restaurants, employers, media organizations, educators, health-care providers, or individuals – can address obesity on its own.
We do not yet have all the answers when it comes to the best way to tackle obesity.
But the rapid rise in obesity rates around the world creates a strong case for experimenting with interventions, to see what works.
Today, investment in obesity research worldwide amounts to some $4 billion a year – just 0.2% of the estimated social costs of obesity.
We can – and must – do more.
Global Risk and Reward in 2011
NEW YORK – The outlook for the global economy in 2011 is, partly, for a persistence of the trends established in 2010. These are: an anemic, below-trend, U-shaped recovery in advanced economies, as firms and households continue to repair their balance sheets; a stronger, V-shaped recovery in emerging-market countries, owing to stronger macroeconomic, financial, and policy fundamentals.
That adds up to close to 4% annual growth for the global economy, with advanced economies growing at around 2% and emerging-market countries growing at about 6%.
But there are downside and upside risks to this scenario.
On the downside, one of the most important risks is further financial contagion in Europe if the eurozone’s problems spread – as seems likely – to Portugal, Spain, and Belgium.
Given the current level of official resources at the disposal of the International Monetary Fund and the European Union, Spain now seems too big to fail yet too big to be bailed out.
The United States represents another downside risk for global growth.
In 2011, the US faces a likely double dip in the housing market, high unemployment and weak job creation, a persistent credit crunch, gaping budgetary holes at the state and local level, and steeper borrowing costs as a result of the federal government’s lack of fiscal consolidation.
Moreover, credit growth on both sides of the Atlantic will be restrained, as many financial institutions in the US and Europe maintain a risk-averse stance toward lending.
In China and other emerging-market economies, delays in policy tightening could fuel a rise in inflation that forces a tougher clampdown later, with China, in particular, risking a hard landing.
There is also a risk that capital inflows to emerging markets will be mismanaged, thus fueling credit and asset bubbles.
Moreover, further increases in oil, energy, and commodity prices could lead to negative terms of trade and a reduction in real disposable income in net commodity-importing countries, while adding to inflationary pressures in emerging markets.
Moreover, currency tensions will remain high.
Countries with large current-account deficits need nominal and real depreciation (to sustain growth via net exports while ongoing private- and public-sector deleveraging keeps domestic demand weak), whereas surplus countries (especially emerging markets) are using currency intervention to resist nominal appreciation and sterilized intervention to combat real appreciation.
This is forcing deficit countries into real exchange-rate adjustments via deflation – and thus a rising burden of public and private debt that may lead to disorderly defaults.
Furthermore, several major geopolitical risks loom, including military confrontation between North and South Korea and the lingering possibility that Israel – or even the US – might use military force to counter Iran’s nuclear weapons program. There are also the political and economic turmoil in Pakistan and the risk of a rise in cyber-attacks – for example, in retaliation for criminal proceedings against WikiLeaks.
In the US, slower private-sector deleveraging – given the fiscal stimulus from the extension of unemployment benefits for 13 months, the payroll-tax cut, and maintenance of current income-tax rates for another two years – could lull policymakers into assuming that relatively large fiscal and current-account imbalances can continue indefinitely.
This could generate financial strains over the medium term – and protectionist pressures in the short term.
Finally, in the face of political opposition to fiscal consolidation, especially in the US, there is a risk that the path of least resistance becomes continued monetization of fiscal deficits.
Eventually (once the slack in goods and labor markets is reduced), this would push inflation expectations – and yield curves – higher.
But there are also several upside risks.
The US corporate sector is strong and very profitable, owing to massive labor shedding, creating scope for increased capital spending and hiring to contribute to more robust and above-trend GDP growth in 2011.
Similarly, the eurozone, driven by Germany, could lurch toward greater economic and political union (especially some form of fiscal union), thus containing the problems of its periphery.
Meanwhile, growth in Germany and the eurozone “core” may further accelerate given the strength of emerging markets, which may show even greater resilience, underpinning more rapid global expansion.
The attenuation of downside risks and pleasant surprises in developed and emerging economies could lead to a further increase in demand for risky assets (equities and credit), which would reinforce economic recovery via wealth effects and lower borrowing costs.
Positive feedback from consumption to production, employment, and income generation – both within countries and across countries via trade channels – could further accelerate the pace of global growth, particularly if monetary policies in most advanced economies remain looser than expected, supporting asset reflation and thus demand and growth.
Indeed, after four years (2007-2010) of either recession or sub-par recovery, the process of balance-sheet repair – while not completed yet – is underway, and may result in less saving and more spending to boost growth in advanced economies.
The damage from the financial crisis is still ongoing, but stronger growth can heal many wounds, especially debt-driven wounds.
So far, the downside and upside risks for the world economy are balanced.
But if sound government policies in advanced and major emerging economies contain the downside risks that are more prevalent in the first half of this year – which derive from political and policy uncertainty – a more resilient global economic recovery could take hold in the second half of 2011 and into 2012.
The Garment Industry’s Technology Challenge
COLOMBO – For many years, discussion of the global garment industry has been dominated by the following question: Where were your clothes made, and by whom?
But today, there is a more relevant question: How were your clothes made, and by what?
What you wear is going high-tech, whether you know it or not.
After decades of labor-intensive production by workers in the Global South, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are replacing humans on the factory floor.
But, while these shifts will bring new benefits to consumers – such as faster delivery and custom clothing – they will come with costs.
Changes to the garment industry’s business model are threatening the livelihoods of millions of people in low- and middle-income countries, and how these economies adapt will have far-reaching implications.
Today, more than half of the world’s textile exports, and about 70% of its ready-made apparel exports, come from developing economies.
In Asia, some 43 million people are employed in the garment, textile, and footwear industries, with women accounting for three-quarters of the workforce.
From China to Bangladesh, textile and apparel manufacturing has facilitated female empowerment and lifted entire generations out of poverty.
Simply put, the end of these jobs would be devastating.
But keeping them will not be easy.
To understand what businesses in the Global South are up against, consider the competition they face.
For example, last year the online retailer Amazon was granted a patent in the United States for an “on demand” apparel manufacturing system that can customize orders and optimize production from anywhere, for less.
The company has already won permitting approval for its first production plant, which will be in Norristown, Pennsylvania.
These moves come two years after Amazon announced its own clothing line.
And, with futuristic inventions like AI analysis of fashion trends and even a “blended-reality” mirror to dress online shoppers virtually, Amazon’s engagement in – and influence on – the clothing business will only deepen.
In many ways, these innovations will be good for the textile and apparel industry.
Not only will they make shopping more fun; they will also increase production efficiency and lower costs.
Major brands will eventually be able to respond more quickly to consumer tastes while keeping inventories low and limiting the production of excess clothing.
In fact, it may be only a matter of time before high street fashion brands swap the “made in” labels from developing countries for “Made by Amazon Manufacturing Services.”
The trouble is, all of these changes will mean fewer jobs for many people.
As factories face closure, communities will lose income and economies will teeter.
The question now is what policymakers should do about it.
For many industries, navigating what the World Economic Forum’s Klaus Schwab has called the Fourth Industrial Revolution means regulating technology.
But in the textile and apparel trade, that alone will not solve the problem.
Instead, the industry must adopt a more human-centric, globally conscious approach to business.
New technologies should be evaluated with human costs in mind – measured in terms of lost incomes, shattered livelihoods, and uprooted families.
Moreover, technology companies must do better at collaborating with apparel manufacturers to manage future platforms.
As traditional factory jobs evolve, technology-servicing roles will become more important.
Just as sewing machines break and need calibration, so, too, will the apparel printers and packaging systems of the future.
Finally, to help ease the transition from manual to modern manufacturing, businesses and governments must begin improving current employees’ tech literacy.
If today’s workforces are to remain relevant in the economies of tomorrow, employees will need the skills to contribute.
And yet, to make any of this possible, leaders in developing countries must come to terms with a hard truth: large pools of cheap labor are no longer a strategic advantage in the global economy. Industrial reinvention is urgently needed.
Governments should advocate for trade agreements that cushion the impact when manufacturing jobs are lost, while laying the groundwork for the transition to more tech-heavy industries.
From factory floors to government offices, bold measures are needed if the Global South is to remain relevant to the global garment industry.
Change is not coming to the world of apparel manufacturing; it is already here.
Technology and the Employment Challenge
MILAN – New technologies of various kinds, together with globalization, are powerfully affecting the range of employment options for individuals in advanced and developing countries alike – and at various levels of education.
Technological innovations are not only reducing the number of routine jobs, but also causing changes in global supply chains and networks that result in the relocation of routine jobs – and, increasingly, non-routine jobs at multiple skill levels – in the tradable sector of many economies.
How, then, should policymakers confront the new and difficult challenges for employment (and, in turn, for the distribution of income and wealth), especially in developed economies?
From recent research, we have learned a number of interesting things about how the evolution of economic structure affects employment.
The tradable side of advanced economies has not generated any real net increases in employment for at least two decades, while the jobs that it has created are concentrated in the upper-income and upper-education ranges, with employment declining in the middle and lower range of income and education.
Growth in high-end services employment is matched by contraction in high-employment components of manufacturing supply chains.
Until the crisis of 2008, middle- and lower-income job growth occurred entirely in the non-tradable sector of the economy, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of advanced countries’ output and employment.
Here, incomes and value added per employee remained largely flat.
Jobs could be eliminated by technology, but not by global competition; and, unsustainable, debt-fueled domestic-demand growth helped to delay the current employment deficits.
As a result, the advanced economies have been shedding routine jobs at a rapid rate, while adding non-routine jobs (for example, those that cannot yet be replaced or reduced by machines and networked computers).
This has fueled a dramatic rise in the return on education and high-level skills, with the share of total income received by owners of capital and high-end employees increasing in advanced countries for more than two decades.
Growth and employment are thus diverging in advanced countries.
The key force driving this trend – technology – is playing multiple roles.
The replacement of routine manual jobs by machines and robots is a powerful, continuing, and perhaps accelerating trend in manufacturing and logistics, while networks of computers are replacing routine white-collar jobs in information processing.
Part of this is pure automation.
Another important part is disintermediation – the elimination of intermediaries in banking, online retail, and a host of government services, to name just a few affected areas.
But technology’s impact does not stop there.
The same class of information technologies that automate, disintermediate, and reduce the costs of remoteness are also enabling the construction of increasingly complex and geographically diverse global supply chains and networks.
Global supply chains – constantly in flux, owing to rising developing-country incomes and shifting comparative advantage – locate productive activities where human and other resources make those activities competitive.
Links in these chains include not only intermediate products and assembly, but also a growing range of services – research and development, design, maintenance and support, customer service, business processes, and more – as transaction, coordination, and communication costs fall.
The result is what is sometimes called the “atomization” of global supply chains: increasingly fine subdivisions are feasible, more efficient, and locatable almost anywhere.
Proximity still matters in terms of transport and logistics costs.
But, with the developing world accounting for the largest new markets and most of the growth in global demand, the logic driving atomization should become even more compelling.
The efficient ongoing decomposition of global supply chains, networks, and services has two related consequences.
First, the tradable part of the global economy – where competition for economic activity and jobs is direct – is becoming a larger share of the whole; the same is true of individual economies.
Second, parts of global supply chains that were not competitive are no longer protected by being adjacent to parts that were.
Adjacency is no longer a requirement.
These dynamics and related challenges are not confined to advanced countries.
Over the next decade, for example, China will replace much of its labor-intensive assembly employment with higher-value-added employment in manufacturing and services, not only in the tradable sector, but also – even more noticeably – in the rapidly growing non-tradable part of its economy.
The expanding scope and diminishing costs of automation and additive manufacturing may affect labor-intensive functions globally, including in earlier-stage developing countries.
A key factor in adapting to these forces is investment.
For individuals, businesses, educational institutions, and governments in advanced countries, broad-based, elevated, and efficient investment in education and skills is critical.
Closing wide information gaps in the market for skills would also increase the efficiency of these investments.
Across-the-board upgrading of human capital will improve income distribution both directly and indirectly (by reducing the supply of lower-skill workers relative to demand).
It will also (partly) mitigate the concentration of wealth that results from a highly skewed income distribution.
On the tradable side, competitiveness depends not only on human capital, but also on a host of other factors: infrastructure, tax systems, regulatory efficiency, policy-induced uncertainty, and energy and health-care costs.
There is no guarantee that taking the right steps in these areas would entirely overcome the employment challenges that individuals and countries face, though doing so would help.
In fact, it is possible that we are entering a period in which major adaptations in employment models, work weeks, contract labor, minimum wages, and the delivery of essential public services will be needed in order to maintain social cohesion and uphold the core values of equity and intergenerational mobility.
The Global Talent Race
WASHINGTON, DC – More than 3% of all people live outside the country of their birth.
But while the share of migrants in the world’s population has remained mostly stable for six decades, its composition has changed.
The share of high-skilled migrants relative to low-skilled migrants has grown dramatically, owing to the globalization of demand for talent.
And this development has a clear geographic dimension.
Nearly 75% of all high-skilled migrants reside in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia; over 70% of software engineers in Silicon Valley are foreign-born.
But today’s leaders could well be tomorrow’s laggards.
Many factors are driving the shift in the composition of migration flows, including the Fourth Industrial Revolution, declining transportation and communication costs (high-skilled migrants tend to travel farther to their destination countries than do less-skilled migrants), and limited educational opportunities in source countries.
The main cause, however, is the growing recognition that human capital plays a key role in today’s knowledge economy.
A worldwide “war for talent” is being waged, and enterprises that manage their global talent pool well are marching ahead.
Most multinational corporations now insist that high-potential executives gain global experience by working in other countries, and they have made international mobility a prerequisite for senior leadership positions.
Some of the global economy’s most familiar players – including Google, Microsoft, Alcoa, Clorox, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Pepsi, and Pfizer – have immigrant CEOs.
But demographics also play a key role in global migration trends.
Whereas most of the developed world is aging, many developing countries have a growing share of young people.
In India, there are four 20-year-olds for every 65-year-old; in Western Europe, that ratio is one to one.
At the same time, average earnings in high-income countries are 70 times higher than in low-income countries.
Combined, these demographic and wage differentials have become a strong impetus for migration.
Though the global talent race initially led developed countries to create special visas to attract high-skilled professionals, political sentiment toward migrants in those countries has since turned negative.
Migration has come to be seen as a threat to native workers in host countries, even though empirical evidence shows that its labor-displacement effect is very small.
In Silicon Valley, for example, immigration has not led to a decline in wages or the return on skills.
Migrants’ adverse effect on a host country’s public finances is also very limited.
Migrants may initially impose a net cost on their host society, but it is small and more short-lived than the cost of schooling a newborn native.
More important, highly educated immigrants have actually contributed positively to public finances in developed countries, because these workers pay more in taxes than they use in public goods and services.
Global talent mobility is also beneficial for source countries, because it helps to integrate them into world markets.
This makes up for some of the shortcomings that firms in developing countries face as a result of lower public investment, inadequate training and equipment, and scarce financial resources to purchase technology licenses or intellectual property.
To be sure, emigration is not an optimal long-term method for improving productivity in a knowledge economy; but it does accelerate technological diffusion in the short run.
Another potent force for global economic integration and exchange is the Internet, which some have come to view as a substitute for global mobility.
But while the Internet does allow for some forms of labor to be provided at a distance, it has not displaced diaspora networks.
Though information and communications technology has reduced the importance of traditional diaspora connections, ICT innovations have also been complemented by these connections.
For example, the exchange of knowledge and technology through India’s links with its diaspora has allowed that country to leap-frog over traditional development stages.
All told, the world has benefited enormously from increased global trade and capital mobility.
Now, it is time to reap the benefits of talent mobility.
Unlike trade and finance/capital, migration remains highly restricted, even though economic growth depends in large part on the availability of employment opportunities and higher returns on labor, which in turn require mobility, both globally and nationally.
Policymakers have many tools to improve global talent mobility.
The multifaceted nature of the issue calls for more partnerships between the public and private sector.
Firms and universities are the frontline participants in the global talent race, but global-governance organizations, multilateral development banks, and civil-society groups also have key roles to play.
So, too, does technology, which now allows for virtual talent mobility through video conferencing, digital platforms, online labor exchanges, and other applications.
The global talent race will continue to accelerate as countries and businesses compete for the best and brightest.
Middle-income non-OECD countries – particularly China and India – are becoming an increasingly important destination for high-skilled labor.
As these countries grow, the global economic clout of the advanced economies will continue to diminish.
The race is on.
The Global Trade Game
CAMBRIDGE – The trade confrontation between the United States and China is heating up.
After firing an opening salvo of steep tariffs on steel and aluminum, the US administration has released a plan for a 25% tariff on 1,333 Chinese imports – worth about $50 billion last year – to punish China for what it views as decades of intellectual property theft.
China has fired back with a plan to slap 25% levies on a range of US goods, also worth about $50 billion.
In response to what he labels “unfair retaliation,” US President Donald Trump is now said to be considering yet another set of tariffs, covering another $100 billion worth of imports from China.
Economists and market analysts are scrambling to figure out what will come next.
One might be tempted to rely on historical experience.
But, given today’s economic, political, and social conditions, history is likely to be a poor guide.
More useful insights come from game theory, which can help us to determine whether this exchange of tariffs will ultimately amount to strategic posturing that leads to a more “cooperative game” (freer and fairer trade), or develop into a wider “non-cooperative game” (an outright trade war).
The answer will have significant consequences for the economic and policy outlook, and markets prospects.
The rapid expansion of trade in recent decades has given rise to a web of cross-border inter-dependencies in production and consumption.
Supply chains now can have as many significant international links as domestic ones, and a substantial share of internal demand is being met by products partly or wholly produced abroad.
As technological innovation further reduces entry barriers for both producers and consumers, the proliferation of these linkages becomes even easier, amplifying what already is essentially a spaghetti bowl of cross-border relationships and dependencies.
For the longer-term health of both individual participants and the overall system, these relationships must function effectively, based on a cooperative approach that is deemed credible.
If not, they risk resulting in a lower level of growth and welfare.
This is why the current confrontation between the US and China has raised fears of serious damage, particularly if it leads to ever-greater protectionism and a wider “trade war.”
But this outcome is not guaranteed.
For international economic interactions to work well, they must also be viewed as fair.
That is currently not the case among many segments of the global population.
As it turns out, two key assumptions on which the virtually unfettered pursuit of economic (and financial) globalization has been based in recent decades have turned out to be over-simplifications.
The first assumption was that the benefits of trade would naturally be shared by most of the population, either directly or because of appropriate redistribution policies implemented in the now-faster growing economies.
Second, it was assumed that the major participants in global trade – including the emerging economies that joined this process and, later, its anchoring institutions, such as the World Trade Organization – would eventually embrace the basic principles of reciprocity, continuing gradually to reduce both tariff and non-tariff barriers.
As these assumptions have proved to be excessively optimistic, the standing and sustainability of pro-trade policies have suffered.
The result has been a marked rise in nationalist populism – a trend that has led to new trade restrictions, the ongoing re-negotiation of existing arrangements (such as the North American Free Trade Agreement), and a backlash against supranational institutions (such as the United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union).
So what about the next steps?
As currently set up, the international economic order needs to function as a cooperative game, in which each participant commits to free and fair trade; the commitments are credible and verifiable; mechanisms are in place to facilitate and monitor collaboration; and cheaters face effective penalties.
Current trade tensions could conceivably destroy this cooperative game, triggering a shift to a non-cooperative one, with elements of a “prisoner’s dilemma,” in which self-interested action turns out to be both individually and mutually destructive.
But, given that this would mean losses for virtually all countries, it may be possible to avoid it, with the help of a few targeted policy responses.
For starters, systemically important but not sufficiently open countries – beginning with China – should liberalize their economies more rapidly (particularly by reducing non-tariff barriers) and adhere to internationally accepted norms on intellectual property.
Moreover, existing trade arrangements should be modernized as needed, so that they better reflect current and future realities, while companies and others that benefit disproportionately from trade should intensify their pursuit of socially responsible activities.
Multilateral surveillance and reconciliation mechanisms – not just at the WTO, but also at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – should be revamped, and the functioning of the G-20 should be improved, including through the establishment of a small secretariat that facilitates greater policy continuity from year to year.
Given how many countries have an interest in maintaining a cooperative game, such policy actions are not just desirable; they may be feasible.
As they help to create a stronger cooperative foundation for fairer trade, these measures would also constitute a necessary (though not sufficient) step toward countering the alienation and marginalization of certain segments of the population in both advanced and emerging economies.
Where Has Global Warming Gone?
SEATTLE – For the last quarter of the twentieth century, the average temperature at the surface of the earth edged inexorably upward.
Then, to the surprise even of scientists, it stopped.
The concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere continued to rise; indeed, it is higher today than it has been for centuries.
And yet, for the last 15 years, according to the conventional way of measuring global warming, the planet does not seem to have become any hotter.
What explains this unexpected turn of events, and what does it mean for future climate policy?
The pause in the rise of surface temperatures is real.
It can be observed in surveys of the surface of the sea and in satellite measurements of the troposphere.
But the reason it has occurred is not that our greenhouse-gas emissions are no longer changing the earth’s climate; it is that surface temperature is a poor metric for human-induced warming.
Indeed, what scientists have figured out is that, instead of warming the surface, the excess heat that is being generated has gone to the deeper oceans.
This calls into question some of the international strategies for combating climate change that are currently being negotiated, such as those aimed at preventing the global temperature at the earth’s surface from rising more than 2º Celsius above the pre-industrial average.
Scientists probably did not adequately convey to the public that their projections for future warming are based on models that account only for the so-called “forced response” in global mean surface temperatures – that is, the change caused by greenhouse-gas emissions.
But what is observed at the surface includes unforced, or natural, variations, such as the El Niño and La Niña fluctuations from year to year, and the 60-70 year cycle from the fluctuations of the Great Ocean Conveyor Belt in the Atlantic.
In fact, this cycle is now thought to bury heat deep in the oceans periodically.
And, because it existed even before humans put significant carbon into the atmosphere, it is likely natural.
Given the oceans’ massive heat-storage capacity, determining how much of the warming remains at the surface over the course of decades is a very difficult task.
Though the challenge is beginning to be appreciated, current projections of the dreaded two-degree warming have yet to take into account variable ocean cycles.
To be sure, surface temperatures remain important.
They are a better measure of the threats posed by climate change than heat sequestered underwater.
But some of the threats that scientists (and economists) deduce from the surface temperature also reflect natural climate change, and thus cannot be mitigated through the reduction of CO2 emissions.
The total amount of heat contained in oceans responds to changes in emissions, and is therefore a better metric for measuring such responses.
Indeed, it has continued to warm as expected, even as the surface temperature has stopped rising.
The oceans’ heat content is measured by a network of more than 3,000 free-drifting robotic floats spread out across the world’s waters, where they routinely dive 2,000 meters beneath the surface.
The temperature they measure is transmitted to orbiting satellites and made available online to anyone in near-real time.
For ease of interpretation, the oceans’ heat content can easily be converted to a mean temperature after dividing by a constant.
In time, models could demonstrate how to relate this new global metric to emissions’ regional climate impact.
The intensive scientific search for an explanation for the pause in global warming at the earth’s surface has led to a better understanding of the complex functioning of the climate.
It confirms the long-held theory that the earth has an energy budget that is affected by radiative perturbations at the top of the atmosphere, though partitioning that energy between the surface and the deeper oceans has been difficult.
Nobody knows how long the current pause will last.
Nonetheless, at some point, the natural cycles will shift; the oceans will cease to absorb the bulk of the planet’s warming; and surface temperatures will begin to climb again.
When they do, we can expect the increase to resume the rapid pace observed during the late twentieth century, when surface temperature rose by about 0.17 degrees Celsius every ten years.
In the meantime, whether the overall risk to our environment has been reduced by the pause remains an open question.
Some argue that what went down will eventually come back up.
The sloshing back and forth of warm and cold waters – El Niño and La Niña – in the shallow layer of the equatorial Pacific Ocean will continue to produce fluctuations in surface temperatures every year.
Over longer periods, however, the risk that the heat currently stored in the deep ocean will resurface is remote.
One thing is clear.
Monitoring surface temperatures does not give us an accurate enough representation of human-induced global warming.
As long as we lack a clear understanding of the relationship between our cumulative greenhouse-gas emissions and the temperature of the earth, it will remain difficult to assess the potential for damage related to climate change caused by humans – or develop the right strategies to minimize it.
The Post-Crisis Crises
NEW YORK – In the shadow of the euro crisis and America’s fiscal cliff, it is easy to ignore the global economy’s long-term problems.
But, while we focus on immediate concerns, they continue to fester, and we overlook them at our peril.
The most serious is global warming.
While the global economy’s weak performance has led to a corresponding slowdown in the increase in carbon emissions, it amounts to only a short respite.
And we are far behind the curve: Because we have been so slow to respond to climate change, achieving the targeted limit of a two-degree (centigrade) rise in global temperature, will require sharp reductions in emissions in the future.
Some suggest that, given the economic slowdown, we should put global warming on the backburner.
On the contrary, retrofitting the global economy for climate change would help to restore aggregate demand and growth.
At the same time, the pace of technological progress and globalization necessitates rapid structural changes in both developed and developing countries alike.
Such changes can be traumatic, and markets often do not handle them well.
Just as the Great Depression arose in part from the difficulties in moving from a rural, agrarian economy to an urban, manufacturing one, so today’s problems arise partly from the need to move from manufacturing to services.
New firms must be created, and modern financial markets are better at speculation and exploitation than they are at providing funds for new enterprises, especially small and medium-size companies.
Moreover, making the transition requires investments in human capital that individuals often cannot afford.
Among the services that people want are health and education, two sectors in which government naturally plays an important role (owing to inherent market imperfections in these sectors and concerns about equity).
Before the 2008 crisis, there was much talk of global imbalances, and the need for the trade-surplus countries, like Germany and China, to increase their consumption.
That issue has not gone away; indeed, Germany’s failure to address its chronic external surplus is part and parcel of the euro crisis.
China’s surplus, as a percentage of GDP, has fallen, but the long-term implications have yet to play out.
America’s overall trade deficit will not disappear without an increase in domestic savings and a more fundamental change in global monetary arrangements.
The former would exacerbate the country’s slowdown, and neither change is in the cards.
As China increases its consumption, it will not necessarily buy more goods from the United States.
In fact, it is more likely to increase consumption of non-traded goods – like health care and education – resulting in profound disturbances to the global supply chain, especially in countries that had been supplying the inputs to China’s manufacturing exporters.
Finally, there is a worldwide crisis in inequality.
The problem is not only that the top income groups are getting a larger share of the economic pie, but also that those in the middle are not sharing in economic growth, while in many countries poverty is increasing.
In the US, equality of opportunity has been exposed as a myth.
While the Great Recession has exacerbated these trends, they were apparent long before its onset.
Indeed, I (and others) have argued that growing inequality is one of the reasons for the economic slowdown, and is partly a consequence of the global economy’s deep, ongoing structural changes.
An economic and political system that does not deliver for most citizens is one that is not sustainable in the long run.
Eventually, faith in democracy and the market economy will erode, and the legitimacy of existing institutions and arrangements will be called into question.
The good news is that the gap between the emerging and advanced countries has narrowed greatly in the last three decades.
Nonetheless, hundreds of millions of people remain in poverty, and there has been only a little progress in reducing the gap between the least developed countries and the rest.
Here, unfair trade agreements – including the persistence of unjustifiable agricultural subsidies, which depress the prices upon which the income of many of the poorest depend – have played a role.
The developed countries have not lived up to their promise in Doha in November 2001 to create a pro-development trade regime, or to their pledge at the G-8 summit in Gleneagles in 2005 to provide significantly more assistance to the poorest countries.
The market will not, on its own, solve any of these problems.
Global warming is a quintessential “public goods” problem.
To make the structural transitions that the world needs, we need governments to take a more active role – at a time when demands for cutbacks are increasing in Europe and the US.
As we struggle with today’s crises, we should be asking whether we are responding in ways that exacerbate our long-term problems.
The path marked out by the deficit hawks and austerity advocates both weakens the economy today and undermines future prospects.
The irony is that, with insufficient aggregate demand the major source of global weakness today, there is an alternative: invest in our future, in ways that help us to address simultaneously the problems of global warming, global inequality and poverty, and the necessity of structural change.
From the Front Lines of Climate Change
MANILA/SAN JOSÉ – On April 22, dignitaries representing no fewer than 175 parties signed the global climate change agreement concluded in Paris in December, setting a record for the adoption of an international accord.
The show of support is heartening.
It provides hope that the momentum that led to the breakthrough deal in December remains undiminished.
But securing an agreement in Paris was just the first step on a long road towards protecting the global climate and the world’s most vulnerable countries. The signing ceremony was the second.
Next comes the ratification process; 55 countries, representing at least 55% of global emissions, will need to ratify the agreement to enable it to enter into force.
The good news is that the process is already underway.
In February, Fiji became the first nation to ratify the treaty, followed by three other small island states.
All four are members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of 43 countries – including Costa Rica and the Philippines, which we represent – on the front lines of climate change.
Members of the forum fought tirelessly for an agreement in Paris, and we will do everything within our power to speed up its entry into force.
The Paris agreement offers the world its best hope of slowing and ultimately stopping changes to our climate.
Left unchecked, global warming will threaten the health and safety of our people, damage the ecosystems on which we all depend, and – through rising sea levels – put the very existence of some countries in jeopardy.
And yet, if the battle against climate change is to be won, the Paris agreement will not be sufficient.
The voluntary emission-reduction commitments contained in the so-called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), submitted by 187 countries by the end of the talks, will not be enough to prevent dangerous climate change.
And for those countries that are most vulnerable to the harmful effects of global warming, far more needs to be done if catastrophic effects are to be avoided.
Early calculations have suggested that if all of the INDCs were fully implemented, average global temperatures would still rise by the end of the century to 2.7 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. That is considerably beyond the already dangerous ceiling of two degrees set in Copenhagen in 2009 and included in the Paris agreement.
New research, from Climate Interactive and MIT Sloan, suggests that temperatures could rise even higher – by 3.5 degrees Celsius.
The Climate Vulnerable Forum has long argued that even two degrees of warming risks creating unbearable conditions for some countries.
That is why it has fought to limit the rise in temperature to 1.5 degrees – an ambition that was included, thanks to the forum’s efforts, in the Paris agreement.
That seemingly small difference matters.
As the latest research shows, it would have a dramatic and measurable impact on extreme weather events, water availability, crop yields, coral-reef degradation, and sea-level rise.
And it will be the most vulnerable people – rural women, the sick, the old, and the very young – who are most at risk.
For the world’s most vulnerable countries, limiting the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees is not just an aspiration; it is a matter of survival.
The goal is an ambitious one. But vulnerable developing countries are committed to helping achieve it.
The V-20 group of finance ministers of vulnerable nations recently committed to introducing carbon-pricing mechanisms across 43 markets within ten years.
We have also pledged to improve financial accounting, so that the costs of climate change and the benefits of climate action are incorporated into economic policymaking.
Costa Rica has just approved a law promoting electric trains, and legislators are debating a bill to provide incentives for electric vehicles and buses.
Such initiatives are more commonly associated with advanced economies than with developing countries.
And the rich world does have a moral obligation to move first and faster – with policies, technologies, and finance – to reduce the emissions that cause global warming.
But we also recognize that developing countries have a responsibility to act and that doing so can generate immense economic, social, and public health advantages for their citizens.
We cannot succeed on our own; this much is certain.
The Climate Vulnerable Forum represents a tiny share of global emissions.
We need the industrialized countries and the giants of the developing world to redouble their efforts to reduce their emissions, so that global warming can be limited to 1.5 degrees.
Only then can disaster be averted.
Global Warming’s Cheap, Effective Solution
COPENHAGEN – Global warming will mean that more people die from the heat.
There will be a rise in sea levels, more malaria, starvation, and poverty.
Concern has been great, but humanity has done very little that will actually prevent these outcomes.
Carbon emissions have kept increasing, despite repeated promises of cuts.
We all have a stake in ensuring that climate change is stopped.
We turned to climate scientists to inform us about the problem of global warming.
Now we need to turn to climate economists to enlighten us about the benefits, costs, and possible outcomes from different responses to this challenge.
World leaders are meeting in Copenhagen this December to forge a new pact to tackle global warming.
Should they continue with plans to make carbon-cutting promises that are unlikely to be fulfilled?
Should they instead delay reductions for 20 years?
What could be achieved by planting more trees, cutting methane, or reducing black soot emissions?
Is it sensible to focus on a technological solution to warming?
Or should we just adapt to a warmer world?
Much of the current policy debate remains focused on cutting carbon, but there are many ways to go about repairing the global climate.
Our choices will result in different outcomes and different costs.
The optimal combination of solutions will create the biggest impact for the least money.
A groundbreaking paper by economists Eric Bickel and Lee Lane is one of the first – and certainly the most comprehensive – study of the costs and benefits of climate engineering.
Deliberately manipulating the earth’s climate seems like something from science fiction. But as President Barack Obama’s science adviser, John Holdren, has said it has “got to be looked at,” and many prominent scientists agree.
Bickel and Lane offer compelling evidence that a tiny investment in climate engineering might be able to reduce as much of global warming’s effects as trillions of dollars spent on carbon emission reductions.
Climate engineering has the advantage of speed.
There is a significant delay between carbon cuts and any temperature drop – even halving global emissions by mid-century would barely be measurable by the end of the century. Making green energy cheap and prevalent will also take a long time.
Consider that electrification of the global economy is still incomplete after more than a century of effort.
Many methods of atmospheric engineering have been proposed.
Solar radiation management appears to be one of the most hopeful.
Atmospheric greenhouse gases allow sunlight to pass through but absorb heat and radiate some down to the earth’s surface.
All else being equal, higher concentrations will warm the planet.
Solar radiation management would bounce a little sunlight back into space.
Reflecting just 1-2% of the total sunlight that strikes the earth could offset as much warming as that caused by doubling preindustrial levels of greenhouse gases.
When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, about a million tons of sulfur dioxide was pumped into the stratosphere, reacting with water to form a hazy layer that spread around the globe, and – by scattering and absorbing incoming sunlight – cooled the earth’s surface for almost two years.
We could mimic this effect through stratospheric aerosol insertion – essentially launching material like sulfur dioxide or soot into the stratosphere.
Another promising approach is marine cloud whitening, which sprays seawater droplets into marine clouds to make them reflect more sunlight.
This augments the natural process, where sea salt from the oceans provides water vapor with the cloud condensation nuclei.
It is remarkable to consider that we could cancel out this century’s global warming with 1,900 unmanned ships spraying seawater mist into the air to thicken clouds.
The total cost would be about $9 billion, and the benefits of preventing the temperature increase would add up to about $20 trillion.
That is the equivalent of doing about $2000 worth of good with every dollar spent.
Many of the risks of climate engineering have been overstated.
Marine cloud whitening would not lead to permanent atmospheric changes, and could be used only when needed.
Turning seawater into clouds is a natural process.
The biggest challenge is public perception.
Many environmental lobbyists oppose even researching climate engineering.
This is startling, given the manifold benefits.
If we care most about avoiding warmer temperatures, it seems that we should be elated that this simple, cost-effective approach shows so much promise.
Climate engineering could remain a back-up option in case of necessity. Or we could put it on the agenda today.
In either case, there is a commanding case for its serious consideration.
We are on track to being the generation that wasted decades bickering over carbon-emission cuts and failed to stop the harmful effects of warming.
That would be a shameful legacy – one that could be avoided by re-thinking climate policy.
Global Warming’s Dirty Secret
Last week, the European Union declared that it had practically saved the planet.
With European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso claiming that Europe will lead the way on climate change, the EU has promised to cut CO2 emissions by 20% below 1990-levels by 2020.
Of course, with the EU already having promised an 8% cut by next year in the Kyoto Protocol, this new target seems slightly less ambitious.
Moreover, in continuing the fundamental problems besetting the crippled Kyoto Protocol, the EU has essentially gone and made a worse deal.
Man-made climate change is, of course, real, and constitutes a serious problem.
Yet the current cut-emissions-now-before-it-is-too-late mindset neglects the fact that the world has no sensible short-term solutions.
This seems to be why we focus on feel-good approaches like the Kyoto Protocol, whose fundamental problem has always been that it is simultaneously impossibly ambitious, environmentally inconsequential, and inordinately expensive.
It required such big reductions that only few countries could live up to it.
Some countries, like the United States and Australia, chose to opt out of its stringent demands; others, like Canada, Japan, and a raft of European states, pay lip service to its requirements but will essentially miss its targets.
Yet, even if everyone had participated and continued to stick to Kyoto’s ever more stringent commitments, it would have had virtually no environmental effect.
The treaty’s effect on temperature would be immeasurable by mid-century and only postpone warming by five years in 2100.
Nonetheless, the cost would have been anything but trivial – an estimated $180 billion per year.
With its high-pitched rhetoric, you would be forgiven for believing that the EU has now single-handedly taken the major step towards solving the problem.
Barroso calls the agreement “historic,” Tony Blair extols its “groundbreaking, bold, ambitious targets,” and German Chancellor Angela Merkel even ventured that the promises “can avoid what could well be a human calamity.”
But nobody sees fit to reveal the agreement’s dirty little secret: it will do next to no good, and again at very high cost.
According to one well-established and peer-reviewed model, the effect of the EU cutting emissions by 20% will postpone warming in 2100 by just two years, yet the cost will be about $90 billion annually.
It will be costly, because Europe is a costly place to cut CO2, and it will be inconsequential, because the EU will account for only about 6% of all emissions in the twenty-first century.
So the new treaty will be an even less efficient use of our resources than the old Kyoto Protocol.
It is important to learn from the past.
We have often been promised dramatic cuts in CO2 emissions far into the future, only to see the promises vanish when we got there.
In Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the West promised to stabilize emissions, but overshot by 12%.
In Kyoto, we were promised a 7% reduction in world emissions, but will probably achieve only 0.4%.
Of course, those promises were made by politicians who in all likelihood will no longer be in office when the time comes to fulfil them.
We will not be able to solve global warming over the next decades, but only the next half or full century.
We need to find a viable, long-term strategy that is smart, equitable, and doesn’t require inordinate sacrifice for trivial benefits.
Fortunately, there is such a strategy: research and development.
Investing in R&D of non-carbon-emitting energy technologies would leave future generations able to make serious and yet economically feasible and advantageous cuts.
A new global warming treaty should mandate spending 0.05% of GDP on R&D in the future.
It would be much cheaper, yet do much more good in the long run.
The EU’s new global warming agreement may help win elections for leaders faced with voters scared by the prospect of climate change.
But it will do virtually no good, at high cost, and – as with many other lofty promises from the EU – it will carry a high probability of failure.
Let us hope that the rest of the world will keep its cool and propose a better, cheaper, and more effective solution for the future.
Global Warming’s Misunderstood Victims
BAMAKO, MALI – Media organizations in wealthy countries regularly send forth reporters to find “victims of global warming.”
In dispatches from the Pacific Islands, Bangladesh, or Ethiopia, journalists warn of impending calamity.
Global warming is the most horrific challenge facing these regions, we are told. Its resolution is vital.
But seldom do we hear from the local people who are said to be in danger.
These people are not voiceless; we just pay no attention to what they say.
The Copenhagen Consensus Center set out to ask people in global-warming hot spots about their fears and hopes.
In Mojo, central Ethiopia, our researchers met Tadese Denkue, a 68-year-old former soldier with no regular income.
“I never know when I will be able to buy myself some food,” he said.
“I only know that I suffer a lot. This is not a decent life.”
Tadese has never heard of global warming.
When it is explained to him, he is dismissive.
He has more immediate concerns: “The first thing I need is food, and then a job.”
Tadese is suffering from his second bout of malaria this year. He has lost count of how many times he has contracted the disease.
Our researcher accompanies him to a free clinic. The electricity is not working.
A doctor admits that most patients are sent home without testing or treatment: the clinic has run out of medicine.
The threat of more malaria has been used to argue for drastic carbon cuts.
Warmer, wetter weather will improve conditions for the malaria parasite.
Most estimates suggest that global warming will put 3% more of the earth’s population at risk of catching malaria by 2100.
The most efficient, global carbon cuts – designed to keep temperature increases under two degrees Celsius – would cost $40 trillion a year by 2100, according to research by Richard Tol for the Copenhagen Consensus Center.
In the best-case scenario, this expenditure would reduce the at-risk population by only 3%.
In comparison, spending $3 billion annually on mosquito nets, environmentally safe indoor DDT sprays, and subsidies for effective new combination therapies could halve the total number of those infected within one decade.
For the money it takes to save one life with carbon cuts, smarter policies could save 78,000 lives.
Of course, malaria is far from the only reason we worry about global warming.
Twenty kilometers from Mojo, our researcher met Desi Koricho and her eight-month-old son, Michel.
Every two weeks, Desi walks four hours to take Michel to the health center.
After two months of malnutrition treatment, Michel has grown a lot but remains half the normal size of a baby his age.
Michel is not Desi’s biological child.
She took him in after his father committed suicide and he was abandoned.
Desi likely suffers from undiagnosed malnutrition herself.
It is rife here.
There are no roads, electricity, or other infrastructure. Conditions are cramped and unhygienic.
“We need everything,” Desi says.
Solving the malnutrition challenge would be a good start.
Campaigners across Europe and the US use the threat of starvation to argue for drastic carbon cuts.
For most regions, weather changes will increase agricultural productivity.
Cruelly, this is not the case for parts of Africa that are already suffering from hunger.
But, as with malaria, all of the evidence shows that direct policies are much more effective than carbon cuts.
One effective, under-appreciated intervention is providing micro-nutrients to those who lack them.
Providing Vitamin A and zinc to 80% of the 140 million or so undernourished children in the world would require a commitment of just $60 million annually.
For $286 million, we could get iron and iodine to more than 2.5 billion people.
The choice is stark: for a few hundred million dollars, we could help almost half of humanity now.
Compare this to the investments to tackle climate change – $40 trillion annually by the end of the century – which would save a hundred times fewer starving people (and in 90 years!).
For every person saved from malnutrition through climate policies, the same money could have saved half a million people from micronutrient malnutrition through direct policies.
Some argue that the choice between spending money on carbon cuts and on direct policies is unfair.
But it is a basic fact that no dollar can be spent twice.
Rich countries and donors have limited budgets and attention spans.
If we spend vast amounts of money on carbon cuts in the mistaken belief that we are stopping malaria and reducing malnutrition, we are less likely to put aside money for the direct policies that would help today.
Indeed, for every dollar spent on strong climate policies, we will likely do about $0.02 of good for the future.
If we spent the same dollar on simple policies to help malnutrition or malaria now, we could do $20 or more good – 1000 times better, when all impacts are taken into account.
On Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania – where the effects of global warming can already be felt – our researcher encountered 28-year-old Rehema Ibrahim.
Rehema was divorced by her husband and disowned by her family after she failed to produce children.
To find out if she was the cause of the infertility, she started sleeping with other men.
She is now HIV-positive, an outcast in a terribly poor society.
Rehema has noticed changes in the weather.
She says that the snow and ice have been melting. She knows what our researcher means by “global warming.”
But, she says: “The issues I am experiencing have greater priority.
The HIV and the problems it is causing are greater than the [receding] ice.”
Campaigners for carbon-emission reductions regularly highlight the melting snow and ice of Mount Kilimanjaro.
But we need to pay as much attention to the people living in the mountain’s shadow.
Global Warming’s Technology Deficit
COPENHAGEN – Our current approach to solving global warming will not work.
It is flawed economically, because carbon taxes will cost a fortune and do little, and it is flawed politically, because negotiations to reduce CO2 emissions will become ever more fraught and divisive.
And even if you disagree on both counts, the current approach is also flawed technologically.
Many countries are now setting ambitious carbon-cutting goals ahead of global negotiations in Copenhagen this December to replace the Kyoto Protocol.
Let us imagine that the world ultimately agrees on an ambitious target.
Say we decide to reduce CO2 emissions by three-quarters by 2100 while maintaining reasonable growth.
Herein lies the technological problem: to meet this goal, non-carbon-based sources of energy would have to be an astounding 2.5 times greater in 2100 than the level of total global energy consumption was in 2000.
These figures were calculated by economists Chris Green and Isabel Galiana of McGill University.
Their research shows that confronting global warming effectively requires nothing short of a technological revolution.
We are not taking this challenge seriously.
If we continue on our current path, technological development will be nowhere near significant enough to make non-carbon-based energy sources competitive with fossil fuels on price and effectiveness.
In Copenhagen this December, the focus will be on how much carbon to cut, rather than on how to do so.
Little or no consideration will be given to whether the means of cutting emissions are sufficient to achieve the goals.
Politicians will base their decisions on global warming models that simply assume that technological breakthroughs will happen by themselves.
This faith is sadly – and dangerously – misplaced.
Green and Galiana examine the state of non-carbon-based energy today – nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal, etc. – and find that, taken together, alternative energy sources would get us less than halfway toward a path of stable carbon emissions by 2050, and only a tiny fraction of the way toward stabilization by 2100.
We need many, many times more non-carbon-based energy than is currently produced.
Yet the needed technology will not be ready in terms of scalability or stability.
In many cases, there is still a need for the most basic research and development.
We are not even close to getting this revolution started.
Current technology is so inefficient that – to take just one example – if we were serious about wind power, we would have to blanket most countries with wind turbines to generate enough energy for everybody, and we would still have the massive problem of storage: we don’t know what to do when the wind doesn’t blow.
Policymakers should abandon fraught carbon-reduction negotiations, and instead make agreements to invest in research and development to get this technology to the level where it needs to be.
Not only would this have a much greater chance of actually addressing climate change, but it would also have a much greater chance of political success.
The biggest emitters of the twenty-first century, including India and China, are unwilling to sign up to tough, costly emission targets.
They would be much more likely to embrace a cheaper, smarter, and more beneficial path of innovation.
Today’s politicians focus narrowly on how high a carbon tax should be to stop people from using fossil fuels.
That is the wrong question.
The market alone is an ineffective way to stimulate research and development into uncertain technology, and a high carbon tax will simply hurt growth if alternatives are not ready.
In other words, we will all be worse off.
Green and Galiana propose limiting carbon pricing initially to a low tax (say, $5.00 a ton) to finance energy research and development.
Over time, they argue, the tax should be allowed to rise slowly to encourage the deployment of effective, affordable technology alternatives.
Investing about $100 billion annually in non-carbon-based energy research would mean that we could essentially fix climate change on the century scale.
Green and Galiana calculate the benefits – from reduced warming and greater prosperity – and conservatively conclude that for every dollar spent this approach would avoid about $11 of climate damage.
Compare this to other analyses showing that strong and immediate carbon cuts would be expensive, yet achieve as little as $0.02 of avoided climate damage.
If we continue implementing policies to reduce emissions in the short term without any focus on developing the technology to achieve this, there is only one possible outcome: virtually no climate impact, but a significant dent in global economic growth, with more people in poverty, and the planet in a worse place than it could be.
Global Warnings
You know how you are told to give your kids organic food because pesticides will give them cancer?
Well, it’s technically true that there is a link between the chemicals and illness, but the risk is miniscule in any well-regulated country.
There is another threat that you haven’t been told much about.
One of the best ways to avoid cancer is to eat lots of fruit and vegetables.
Organic items are 10% or 20% more expensive than regular produce, so most of us naturally buy less when we “go organic.”
If you reduce your child’s intake of fruits and vegetables by just 0.03 grams a day (that’s the equivalent of half a grain of rice) when you opt for more expensive organic produce, the total risk of cancer goes up, not down.
Omit buying just one apple every 20 years because you have gone organic, and your child is worse off.
My intention isn’t to scare people away from organic food.
But we should hear both sides of any story.
Consider a tale that has made the covers of some of the world’s biggest magazines and newspapers: the plight of the polar bear.
We are told that global warming will wipe out this majestic creature.
We are not told, however, that over the past 40 years – while temperatures have risen – the global polar bear population has increased from 5,000 to 25,000.
Campaigners and the media claim that we should cut our CO2 emissions to save the polar bear.
Well, then, let’s do the math.
Let’s imagine that every country in the world – including the United States and Australia – were to sign the Kyoto Protocol and cut its CO2 emissions for the rest of this century.
Looking at the best-studied polar bear population of 1,000 bears, in the West Hudson Bay, how many polar bears would we save in a year?
Ten?
Twenty?
A hundred?
Actually, we would save less than one-tenth of a polar bear.
If we really do care about saving polar bears, we could do something much simpler and more effective: ban hunting them.
Each year, 49 bears are shot in the West Hudson Bay alone.
So why don’t we stop killing 49 bears a year before we commit trillions of dollars to do hundreds of times less good?
From the promotion of organic food to declarations of the polar bear’s imminent demise, the media pelt us with a constant barrage of one-sided warnings.
The list of urgent concerns is topped by global warming, but also includes terrorism, pesticides, and the loss of biodiversity – and seems to have virtually no end.
All the while, we know of the terrible conditions that still face the majority of the world’s population, with more than a billion poor, two billion without electricity, and three billion without clean drinking water and sanitation.
Much of my work is to make sense of all these global warnings.
I try to put them in perspective and figure out which ones really should concern us, and when we should act on them.
Perhaps surprisingly, not everything of concern should be dealt with immediately.
If we don’t have a good way to fix a problem, it might be better to focus on something else first.
After all, when you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, it’s hard to worry about what global temperatures will be 100 years from now.
Things have improved immensely in both the developing and developed worlds.
In the last 100 years, scientists have won many of the most important battles against infectious diseases, to the extent that poverty is now the main reason for a lack of treatment.
Global average life expectancy in 1900 was 30 years; today, it is 68 years.
Food has become more plentiful and affordable, especially in the developing world, where calorie availability has increased by 40% per person over the past 40 years, while food prices have more than halved.
Consequently, the proportion of hungry in the Third World has dropped from 50% in 1950 to less than 17% today, while worldwide incomes have increased more than three-fold.
Perhaps most importantly, all of these positive trends are expected to continue.
The United Nations estimates that average life expectancy will reach 75 years by the middle of the century, and that the proportion of those going hungry will drop below 4%.
By the close of the century, incomes will have increased six-fold in industrialized countries and 12-fold in developing countries, making the average person in the developing world richer in 2100 than the average American or European is today.
The number of poor will drop from a billion to less than five million.
None of this means we should stop worrying about the future.
But it does mean that we can quit panicking and start thinking calmly to ensure that we focus on the right issues.
Global alarm bells might cause pangs of guilt for wealthy Westerners, but they don’t give us an adequate understanding of what’s going on.
We all need to hear both sides of the story.
GMOs and Junk Science
STANFORD – In today’s media landscape, where unfounded opinions, hype, and rumors are rife, the scientific method – the means by which we determine, based on empirical and measurable evidence, what is true – should serve as a touchstone of reality.
Science enables us to gauge what we think we know and to identify what we do not.
Most important, it discredits false claims made for personal or political reasons – at least it should.
But scientists occasionally “go rogue,” forsaking the scientific method – often for notoriety or economic gain – to produce propaganda and to sow fear in a public that lacks expertise but is hungry for information.
This abuse of scientific authority is especially widespread in the “organic” and “natural” food industries, which capitalize on people’s fear of synthetic or “unnatural” products.
A recent example is the Indian-American scientist V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai, who, with Prabhakar Deonikar, published the much-ridiculed paper “Do GMOs Accumulate Formaldehyde and Disrupt Molecular Systems Equilibria?
Systems Biology May Provide Answers.”
(“GMOs” are “genetically modified organisms,” itself a misleading and often unfairly stigmatized non-category, circumscribing a universe of organisms modified with the most modern and precise techniques of genetic engineering.)
Although the article supposedly passed the peer-review process, a key component of legitimate science, it appeared in a low-impact “pay-for-play” journal, Agricultural Sciences, which is produced by a “predatory” publisher.
Within days of publication, anti-biotechnology organizations like the Organic Consumers Association and GMO Inside were reporting on Ayyadurai’s “findings” with frightening headlines – “Formaldehyde in GMO Soy?” and “New Study Shows GMO Soy Accumulates Cancer Causing Chemical Formaldehyde” – accompanied by scary graphics.
But the problems with Ayyadurai’s paper are legion.
Its title alone is enough to show that something is amiss.
If you think that GMOs might “accumulate formaldehyde” – a chemical that is probably carcinogenic at high levels but is present in most living cells and found widely in our environment – the obvious response would be to measure its levels in the organisms.
Ayyadurai, however, chose to make guesses based on modeling via “systems biology.”
“Systems biology” enables only a prediction, not an experimental conclusion.
Rather than actually testing the levels of any chemicals in plants, Ayyadurai plugged data into a computer algorithm to predict the levels of two chemicals, formaldehyde and glutathione.
This is akin to a meteorologist predicting from his models that it will be sunny all day, instead of looking out the window to see whether rain is falling.
To be sure, as Kevin Folta, the head of the horticultural sciences department at the University of Florida, explained, systems biology can be a useful approach if employed properly.
As he put it, systems biology “is a way to make predictions based on integrating existing data, and then statistically deriving a likelihood that the predictions may be correct.”
But, he emphasizes, the predictions are then to be tested, “and the systems approach validated.”
Like all predictive studies based on computer modeling, the validity of the results depends on the integrity of the data and the algorithm.
If the data are cherry-picked to support the modeler’s desired conclusions, or if the algorithm is flawed, the results will be inaccurate.
But it is unclear from Ayyadurai’s article which data were used, and there is no validation of the model.
Folta offers a brilliant send-up of Ayyadurai’s work.
“If you developed a computer program that integrated Internet data to predict the location of Munich, and the program told you it was squarely in the Gulf of Mexico, right off Florida, it does not mean that Munich is in the Gulf of Mexico, right off of Florida.”
Instead, it means that you have made a mistake, in your program, assumptions, or input data – all of which are testable.
To decide not to challenge those data, Folta continues, and instead to “publish a map showing that Munich is squarely in the Gulf of Mexico, opposing all other data and the claims of millions of rather dry Germans, does not mean that you are brilliant.
It means you have absolutely no clue, or more likely, have some reason you want a major German metropolis to be a two-hour boat ride from Tampa.”
Folta also has something to say about Ayyadurai’s publisher.
If you print the deceptive map showing the location of Munich, “what does that say about your integrity as a reliable information source?”
In the spirit of scientific cooperation, Folta offered to collaborate with Ayyadurai on university-based testing of genetically engineered corn and soy samples (along with appropriate controls), with analysis by an independent lab.
Ayyadurai declined, so Folta will proceed himself.
The experimental data is forthcoming.
In the meantime, if you get a hankering for sauerbraten and spaetzle, head for Central Europe, not the Gulf of Mexico.
Godless Morality
Is religion necessary for morality?
Many people consider it outrageous, even blasphemous, to deny the divine origin of morality.
Either some divine being crafted our moral sense, or we picked it up from the teachings of organized religion.
Either way, we need religion to curb nature’s vices.
Paraphrasing Katherine Hepburn in the movie The African Queen, religion allows us to rise above wicked old Mother Nature, handing us a moral compass.
Yet problems abound for the view that morality comes from God.
One problem is that we cannot, without lapsing into tautology, simultaneously say that God is good, and that he gave us our sense of good and bad.
For then we are simply saying that God meets God’s standards.
A second problem is that there are no moral principles that are shared by all religious people, regardless of their specific beliefs, but by no agnostics and atheists.
Indeed, atheists and agnostics do not behave less morally than religious believers, even if their virtuous acts rest on different principles.
Non-believers often have as strong and sound a sense of right and wrong as anyone, and have worked to abolish slavery and contributed to other efforts to alleviate human suffering.
The opposite is also true.
Religion has led people to commit a long litany of horrendous crimes, from God’s command to Moses to slaughter the Midianites – men, women, boys, and non-virginal girls – through the Crusades, the Inquisition, innumerable conflicts between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, and suicide bombers convinced that martyrdom will lead them to paradise.
The third difficulty for the view that morality is rooted in religion is that some elements of morality seem to be universal, despite sharp doctrinal differences among the world’s major religions.
In fact, these elements extend even to cultures like China, where religion is less significant than philosophical outlooks like Confucianism.
Perhaps a divine creator handed us these universal elements at the moment of creation.
But an alternative explanation, consistent with the facts of biology and geology, is that over millions of years we have evolved a moral faculty that generates intuitions about right and wrong.
For the first time, research in the cognitive sciences, building on theoretical arguments emerging from moral philosophy, has made it possible to resolve the ancient dispute about the origin and nature of morality.
Consider the following three scenarios.
For each, fill in the blank space with “obligatory,” “permissible,” or “forbidden.”
1.
A runaway boxcar is about to run over five people walking on the tracks.
A railroad worker is standing next to a switch that can turn the boxcar onto a side track, killing one person, but allowing the five to survive.
Flipping the switch is ______.
2.
You pass by a small child drowning in a shallow pond, and you are the only one around.
If you pick up the child, she will survive and your pants will be ruined.
Picking up the child is _______.
3.
Five people have just been rushed into a hospital in critical condition, each requiring an organ to survive.
There is not enough time to request organs from outside the hospital, but there is a healthy person in the hospital’s waiting room.
If the surgeon takes this person’s organs, he will die, but the five in critical care will survive.
Taking the healthy person’s organs is _______.
If you judged case 1 as permissible, case 2 as obligatory, and case 3 as forbidden, then you are like the 1,500 subjects around the world who responded to these dilemmas on our web-based moral sense test (http://moral.wjh.harvard.edu/).
If morality is God’s word, atheists should judge these cases differently from religious people, and their responses should rely on different justifications.
For example, because atheists supposedly lack a moral compass, they should be guided by pure self-interest and walk by the drowning child.
But there were no statistically significant differences between subjects with or without religious backgrounds, with approximately 90% of subjects saying that it is permissible to flip the switch on the boxcar, 97% saying that it is obligatory to rescue the baby, and 97% saying that is forbidden to remove the healthy man’s organs.
When asked to justify why some cases are permissible and others forbidden, subjects are either clueless or offer explanations that cannot account for the relevant differences.
Importantly, those with a religious background are as clueless or incoherent as atheists.
These studies provide empirical support for the idea that, like other psychological faculties of the mind, including language and mathematics, we are endowed with a moral faculty that guides our intuitive judgments of right and wrong.
These intuitions reflect the outcome of millions of years in which our ancestors have lived as social mammals, and are part of our common inheritance.
Our evolved intuitions do not necessarily give us the right or consistent answers to moral dilemmas.
What was good for our ancestors may not be good today.
But insights into the changing moral landscape, in which issues like animal rights, abortion, euthanasia, and international aid have come to the fore, have not come from religion, but from careful reflection on humanity and what we consider a life well lived.
In this respect, it is important for us to be aware of the universal set of moral intuitions so that we can reflect on them and, if we choose, act contrary to them.
We can do this without blasphemy, because it is our own nature, not God, that is the source of our morality.
Going “Soft” on Iran
BRUSSELS – 2010 will be a crucial and uncertain year for the Islamic Republic of Iran – and for its relations with the European Union.
The domestic hostility towards the regime that erupted in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections last June has not died away, but has become stronger and more determined.
The Ashura riots of last December and the violent suppression of protests during the recent anniversary to mark the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution were some of the fiercest to date.
The regime’s sharp crackdown ahead of the anniversary did not stop thousands from marching in the streets, despite the threat of swift retribution.
The likelihood of more arrests, trials, and bloodshed is a concern for many in the international community.
More ominously, following riots the regime put 16 opposition members on trial for taking part in the demonstrations, with prosecutors indicating that some would be charged with the offense of mohareb , or “making a war against God” – a capital crime.
The heavy-handed approach adopted by the regime is causing friction among even its loyalists.
A former member of Iran’s parliament, Javad Ettaat, argues that the “government is contravening the principles of Islam by using an iron fist against protesters.”
Mohammad Taghi Khalaji, a cleric and devoted follower of Ayatollah Khomeini, was arrested on January 12 after saying at a Tehran mosque that Iran’s leaders should repent for their actions.
Moreover, an Iranian diplomat in Oslo, Mohammed Reza Heydari, resigned in protest against the regime’s behavior after the December riots.
Other Iranian diplomats also are reportedly resigning from their posts and seeking asylum abroad.
The European Parliament has been paying close attention to the deteriorating situation in Iran.
There has been pressure to impose targeted sanctions aimed at impeding the financial operations of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which holds a virtual monopoly over strategic industries such as banking, defense and construction.
Many European companies have profited from investing in such firms, which means deciding on the terms of sanctions could prove cumbersome.
On the issue of Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the Iranian government’s equivocal position also is a source of growing concern.
Many European lawmakers are worried by the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran on Europe’s doorstep, and are not convinced by the regime’s claim that it seeks only nuclear energy.
It is critical, therefore, that the EU demonstrate its commitment to the Iranian people through actions, rather than words – a complaint that many Iranians level against Western powers – by taking a tougher stance against the regime.
Targeted sanctions aimed at the Revolutionary Guard would be an important step, but so is clearly expressing solidarity with the millions of Iranian men and women who are fighting for a democratic and pluralist society.
Europe should stand with Iran's civil society, and the European Parliament has already paid tribute to the courage of all those Iranian men and women who are defending their basic freedoms and democratic principles.
A concrete demonstration of its commitment is the request to make better use of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.
Eighty MEPs, including the Parliament’s former president, Hans-Gert Pöttering, and former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, are urging the Parliament to honor its commitment to human rights by remembering the life of Neda Agha Soltan, the young woman who was killed last June in Tehran while standing up for her rights.
We believe that the European Parliament should commemorate her sacrifice by hanging a poster of her image on the external wall of the Parliament’s premises in Brussels, beside the poster of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma’s democratic opposition.
Agha Soltan has become the symbol of the desire for freedom of a people that Europe must help.
This simple act could demonstrate the importance of Europe’s soft power, which frightens the Islamic Republic more than the threat of military force by keeping the media spotlight on the regime’s human rights record and emphasizing its growing isolation.
It would also foster stronger ties between Iran’s civil society and the outside world, while setting an example to the international community that the EU is committed to the principles enshrined in its own Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Europe’s policy for Iran is not regime change, but when human rights and democracy are at stake, we cannot simply close our eyes.
Going to the Dogs
GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA – There are about 70 million dogs living in human homes in the United States. That’s 10 million more dogs than children under the age of 15.
The pattern in other Western nations is similar.
Roughly 40% of house dogs are allowed to sleep on their owners’ beds.
How did dogs achieve such an intimate position in our lives?
One theory is that, in the thousands of years that dogs have lived with humans, they have become attuned to human ways of thinking.
Certainly dogs have a remarkable sensitivity to human behavior.
Dogs are able to follow human pointing gestures to find hidden food, and they can indicate successfully to their owners by their own pointing actions where a hidden toy is located.
Under certain circumstances, dogs understand that a human who cannot see them (because, for example, she is blindfolded) is less likely to respond to begging with a tasty treat than a person whose vision is not obscured.
Dogs are also more likely to obey a command to leave something desirable alone if their master stays in the room than if he steps out.
And yet attempts to view canine smarts as cut from the same cloth as human intelligence gloss over a lot of the details about how dogs and humans operate.
Evolution doesn’t ever build the same form of intelligence twice – even though similar problems may lead to similar solutions.
As most owners of puppies know, it takes time and care for a dog to learn the ways of humans.
We don’t literally raise our hackles when angry, or sniff each other’s backsides when making new friends.
And dogs don’t gesture with their forepaws or use an elaborate grammatical language when trying to explain things.
In our own research, we have found that people remain somewhat mysterious to dogs for the first five months of life, and dogs at our local pound lag considerably behind house dogs when it comes to understanding human beings.
Recent research by Alexandra Horowitz at Barnard College in New York accentuates the “talking past each other” that sometimes goes on between humans and dogs.
Horowitz asked owners to forbid their dogs to take a biscuit and then briefly leave the room.
When the owners returned after a few moments away, some were told that their dogs had been naughty and eaten the forbidden food.
Others were told their dog had been good and left the biscuit alone.
If the dog had misbehaved, the owner was given a moment to berate his pet for its misdeed.
The owners were then asked whether their dog looked guilty.
The twist in this tale is that only half of the owners were correctly informed.
Half of the time, Horowitz told the owner of a dog that had actually left the biscuit alone that his dog had taken the treat.
And half the time the owner of a naughty dog was told that his dog had been good.
The point of this deception was that when Horowitz asked each owner whether his dog looked guilty, she could consider whether the owner’s report of “guilty looks” actually had to do with the facts of the matter – whether the dog had taken the forbidden treat – or whether it reflected nothing more than whether the owner had chastised his hound.
The results showed very clearly that a dog’s “guilty looks” came about solely because it was being scolded: the look had nothing to do with whether the dog had really committed an offense.
This does not mean that we should not chastise our dogs (or praise them).
Nor does it mean that we should not love our dogs – or sometimes be frustrated by them.
All it means is that, if we want to live harmoniously with another species in our most intimate places, we must recognize that some of the time our preferred modes of reasoning are not theirs.
We must try to understand dogs on their own terms, and help them to understand us.
Emerging Markets Should Go for the Gold
CAMBRIDGE – Are emerging-market central banks overweight in dollars and underweight in gold?
Given a slowing global economy, in which emerging markets are probably very grateful for any reserves they retain, this might seem an ill-timed question.
But there is a good case to be made that a shift in emerging markets toward accumulating gold would help the international financial system function more smoothly and benefit everyone.
Just to be clear, I am not siding with those – usually American far-right crackpots – who favor a return to the gold standard, in which countries fix the value of their currencies in terms of gold.
After all, the gold standard’s last reign ended disastrously in the 1930s, and there is no reason to believe that a return to it would turn out any differently.
No, I am just proposing that emerging markets shift a significant share of the trillions of dollars in foreign-currency reserves that they now hold (China alone has official reserves of $3.3 trillion) into gold.
Even shifting, say, up to 10% of their reserves into gold would not bring them anywhere near the many rich countries that hold 60-70% of their (admittedly smaller) official reserves in gold.
For some time, the rich countries have argued that it is in everyone’s collective interest to demonetize gold.
Sure, we hold a lot of gold, these countries say, but that is a vestige of the pre-World War II gold standard, when central banks needed a stockpile.
Indeed, back in 1999, European central banks, seeing no reason to keep holding so much gold, entered a pact to start reducing their stocks in an orderly fashion.
The sales made sense at the time for most of the participating countries: The real backing for their debt was the tax reach of their governments, their high levels of institutional development, and their relative political stability.
The 1999 pact has been revisited periodically, though since the most recent edition in 2014, most rich countries have taken a long pause, still leaving them with extremely high gold reserves.
Emerging markets have remained buyers of gold, but at a snail’s pace compared to their voracious appetite for US Treasury bonds and other rich-country debt.
As of March 2016, China held just over 2% of its reserves in gold, and the share for India was 5%. Russia is really the only major emerging market to increase its gold purchases significantly, in no small part due to Western sanctions, with holdings now amounting to almost 15% of reserves.
Emerging markets hold reserves because they do not have the luxury of being able to inflate their way out of a financial crunch or a government debt crisis.
Simply put, they live in a world where a large fraction of international debt – and an even larger share of global trade – is still denominated in hard currency.
So they hold reserves of such currencies as a backstop against fiscal and financial catastrophe.
Yes, in principle, it would be a much better world if emerging markets could somehow pool their resources, perhaps through an International Monetary Fund facility; but the trust required to make such an arrangement work simply is not yet there.
Why would the system work better with a larger share of gold reserves?
The problem with the status quo is that emerging markets as a group are competing for rich-country bonds, which is helping to drive down the interest rates they receive.
With interest rates stuck near zero, rich-country bond prices cannot drop much more than they already have, while the supply of advanced-country debt is limited by tax capacity and risk tolerance.
Gold, despite being in nearly fixed supply, does not have this problem, because there is no limit on its price.
Moreover, there is a case to be made that gold is an extremely low-risk asset with average real returns comparable to very short-term debt.
And, because gold is a highly liquid asset – a key criterion for a reserve asset – central banks can afford to look past its short-term volatility to longer-run average returns.
True, gold does not pay interest, and there are costs associated with storage.
But these costs can be managed relatively efficiently by holding gold offshore if necessary (many countries hold gold at the New York Federal Reserve); and, over time, the price can go up.
It is for this reason that the system as a whole can never run out of monetary gold.
I don’t want to create the impression that by shifting into gold, emerging markets would somehow benefit at the expense of advanced economies.
After all, the status quo is that advanced-economy central banks and treasuries hold vastly more gold than emerging markets do, and a systematic shift by emerging markets will bid up its price.
But this is not a systemic problem; and, in fact, a rise in gold prices would close part of the gap between demand and supply for safe assets that has emerged due to the zero lower bound on interest rates.
There has never been a compelling reason for emerging markets to buy into the rich-country case for completely demonetizing gold. And there isn’t one now.
Golden Rules for the Eurozone
LONDON – The European Monetary Union, as many of its critics maintain, looks a lot like the pre-1913 gold standard, which imposed fixed exchange rates on extremely diverse economies.
But is that resemblance as bad as it sounds, or as the euro’s critics insist?
The appeal of the historic gold standard lay in an institutional capacity to build confidence.
A completely fixed exchange rate rules out monetary-policy initiative, and consequently makes adjustment to large external imbalances very difficult to carry out.
And the burden is unequal, because there is much more pressure on deficit countries to adjust via deflation than on creditor countries to allow higher inflation.
Pessimists are especially worried by the unpleasant gold-standard analogies and lessons.
They foresee years and even decades of slow growth in Europe.
Politically, too, the process of adjustment by deflation in deficit countries is so unpleasant and difficult that many pessimists think it will ultimately prove to be unsustainable.
But critics of the euro should take the gold-standard analogy more seriously.
Like any system in the real world, it was more complex, more interesting, and also filled with more real policy possibilities than textbook caricatures suggest.
First, there was no automatic deflationary pressure following from some alleged peculiarity of the adjustment mechanism.
The question of overall deflationary – or inflationary – impact depended (and still depends) on the total quantity of money.
Thus, in periods after large new gold discoveries – for example, following the California Gold Rush of 1849, and again in the 1890’s, when new mining techniques opened up South African, Alaskan, and Australian reserves – the classical gold standard had a mild inflationary bias.
In an era of paper money, however, the link to a physical stock of some precious metal – or, indeed, some other commodity – does not exist, and there should be no reason why a central bank cannot aim at an overall inflation rate.
In fact, almost all modern central banks, including the European Central Bank, do precisely that.
The second lesson to be learned from the gold standard concerns the extent and limits of capital-market integration.
In the early 1990’s, policymakers, market participants, and economists alike simply assumed that the European Community’s “1992 program” – the legislative framework for the single market, and thus for a single capital market – would create a new reality, within which the single currency would work its magic.
From this followed an official obligation to treat all types of risk in the monetary union – bank risk or government risk – as identical.
But the history of the gold standard, and of other large common-currency areas, was more complex.
Despite the theoretical possibility of capital being sent over vast distances to other parts of the world, much capital remained local.
Creditors and banks often preferred to do business with known borrowers, and where local jurisdictions could settle any disputes.
In particular, a critical part of the gold standard was that individual national central banks set their own interest rates, with the aim of influencing the direction of capital movements.
This became the central feature of the gold-standard world: a country that was losing gold reserves would tighten interest rates in order to attract money.
The gold-standard rules look very different from the modern practice of monetary union, which relies on a single uniform interest rate.
That one-size-fits-all approach meant that interest rates in southern European countries were too low before 2009, and too high in northern Europe.
A gold-standard rule would have produced higher rates for the southern European borrowers, which would have attracted funds to where capital might be productively used, and at the same time acted as a deterrent against purely speculative capital flows.
Since the 2008 financial crisis erupted, there has been something of a renationalization of financial behavior in Europe.
Up to the late 1990’s and the advent of monetary union, most European Union sovereign debt was domestically held: in 1998, the overall ratio of foreign-held debt was only one-fifth.
That ratio climbed rapidly in the aftermath of the euro’s introduction.
In 2008, on the eve of the crisis, three-quarters of Portuguese debt, one-half of Spanish and Greek debt, and more than two-fifths of Italian debt was held by foreigners, with foreign banks holding a significant proportion, especially in the case of Greece, Portugal, and Italy.
One consequence of the ECB’s large-scale long-term refinancing operation (LTRO) has been that Italian banks are once again buying Italian government bonds, and Spanish banks are buying Spanish bonds.
German Economics Minister Philipp Rösler has made the fascinating suggestion that members of the European System of Central Banks should set their own interest rates (though, interestingly, he made this suggestion explicitly as a party politician, not as a government minister).
Autonomous interest-rate determination would penalize banks that have borrowed in southern Europe from their national central banks.
Meanwhile, the German Bundesbank would have lower rates, but southern European banks would be unlikely to have access to that credit for use in their own markets.
There are also signs that individual central banks are using the leeway that they have within the existing framework in order to carry out important policy shifts.
The Bundesbank has stated that it will no longer accept bank securities as collateral from banks that have undergone a government recapitalization.
The new collateral requirements, together with tentative talk of autonomous interest rates, represents a remarkable incipient innovation.
In the aftermath of the crisis, some policymakers are beginning to see that a monetary union is not necessarily identical with unfettered capital mobility.
Recognition of diverse credit quality is a step back into the nineteenth-century world, and at the same time forward to a more market-oriented and less distorting currency policy.
Different interest rates in different countries might open the door to a more stable eurozone.
Good and Bad Capitalism
PARIS – The reality of market exchange – direct transactions between merchants and customers – appeared gradually 3,000 or 4,000 years ago.
In this novel social relationship, the customer was free to buy whatever he wanted, whenever and from whomever he chose, often bargaining with the seller about the price.
Because of these features, the free market is part of a basic freedom that is rooted in everyday life.
It remains dominant today, as all efforts to establish an alternative, even totalitarianism, failed.
Indeed, it has been 20 years since the former communist countries of Eastern Europe rejoined the world of market exchange, a step taken as early as 1946 by social democrats around the world.
For several thousand years, the free market was comprised of individuals: craftsmen, traders, and consumers.
Capitalism when it arose three centuries ago was simply the same activity on a larger scale.
Because of steam engines and electricity, a large number of people were enabled to work together, and corporations could attract a large number of small savers, who became capitalists.
This system is fantastic.
By the time of the French Revolution, the standard of living had hardly doubled since the Roman Empire. Today, it is 150 times higher.
But capitalism is also cruel.
At its inception, people were compelled to work 17 hours a day without a day off or retirement. It was a form of slavery.
Thanks to democracy, social struggle, and workers’ unions, together with the political efforts of social democracy, the inhumanity of the system was partly softened.
Nevertheless, left to itself, the system is unstable.
It undergoes a crisis about once a decade.
The twentieth century’s worst crisis, between 1929 and 1932, caused 70 million workers in Great Britain, the United States, and Germany to lose their jobs (with no unemployment benefits) in less than six months.
It brought Adolf Hitler to power, leading to a war that left 50 million dead.
After the war, the belief that the system needed to be stabilized became widespread. Eventually, a more balanced system emerged, based on three main institutions: health insurance, Keynesian fiscal and monetary policy to soften the impact of the business cycle, and, of utmost importance, a policy of high salaries and reduction of economic inequality in order to boost household consumption.
The achievement was stunning: 30 years of consistent and rapid economic growth, full and permanent employment in all developed nations, and no financial or economic crisis.
Standards of living rose nearly ten-fold during this period.
Prosperity became the main weapon that ensured the West’s victory over Soviet communism.
The people of Eastern Europe were eager to embrace this kind of capitalism.
Capitalism’s political success, however, came at the very moment when the system was starting to deteriorate.
High salaries drove growth but reduced earnings.
Shareholders organized themselves into pension funds, investment funds, and hedge funds. Because of their pressure, employment fell, reducing the share of wages in total national income by 10% over the past 30 years.
In developed nations, the number of the working poor reached 10-15% of the workforce, with another 5-10% of unemployed workers and 5-10% dropping out of the labor market altogether.
Moreover, over the past 25 years, a severe financial crisis – regional or global – has erupted every four or five years.
Annual growth fell below 3% on average.
Today’s crisis was triggered by widespread concealment of bad loans within pools of securities sold all over the world.
The spread of bankruptcies triggered a severe credit crunch, which triggered a deep recession and with it a brutal rise in unemployment.
Capitalism’s three stabilizing devices lost their efficacy.
While rich countries reacted more quickly and more wisely in stimulating their economies than in 1929, and the hemorrhaging of banks was stanched, this has not been enough to boost growth.
We are now in a strange period in which governments, bankers, and journalists herald the end of the crisis just because large banks are no longer failing every week.
But nothing has been solved, and unemployment continues to rise.
Even worse, the banking sector is trying to take advantage of publicly financed rescue packages to protect its privileges, including immorally huge bonuses and extravagant freedoms to create speculative financial assets with no links to the real economy.
Indeed, the so-called end of the crisis looks more like a reconstruction of the mechanisms that caused it.
Everywhere, economic activity is painfully stabilizing at 5% to 10% below 2007 levels.
The root of the crisis remains the fall in purchasing power on the part of the middle and lower classes, and the collapse of speculative bubbles created by the wealthy classes’ greed for more.
But if we are to have a system where nearly everybody can become better off, the wealthy cannot become ever wealthier at the same time.
Otherwise, we can expect a long period of stagnation, punctuated by periodic financial crises.
In these circumstances, a majority of European voters have recently shown, once again, that they favor the right and its tendency to support the fortune seekers.
A bleak future awaits us.
Good and Bad Deficits
LONDON – “Deficits are always bad,” thunder fiscal hawks.
Not so, replies strategic investment analyst H. Wood Brock in an interesting new book, The American Gridlock.
A proper assessment, Brock argues, depends on the “composition and quality of total government spending.”
Government deficits incurred on current spending for services or transfers are bad, because they produce no revenue and add to the national debt.
Deficits resulting from capital spending, by contrast, are – or can be – good.
If wisely administered, such spending produces a revenue stream that services and eventually extinguishes the debt; more importantly, it raises productivity, and thus improves a country’s long-run growth potential.
From this distinction follows an important fiscal rule: governments’ current spending should normally be balanced by taxation.
To this extent, efforts nowadays to reduce deficits on current spending are justified, but only if they are fully replaced by capital-spending programs.
Indeed, reducing current spending and increasing capital spending should be carried out in lock step.
Brock’s argument is that, given the state of its economy, the United States cannot return to full employment on the basis of current policy.
The recovery is too feeble, and the country needs to invest an additional $1 trillion annually for ten years on transport facilities and education.
The government should establish a National Infrastructure Bank to provide the finance by borrowing directly, attracting private-sector funds, or a mixture of the two.
(I have proposed a similar institution in the United Kingdom.)
The distinction between capital and current spending (and thus between “good” and “bad” deficits) is old hat to any student of public finance.
But we forget knowledge at such an alarming rate that it is worth re-stating it, particularly with deficit hawks in power in the UK and Europe, though fortunately not (yet) in the US.
According to proposals agreed at an informal European Council meeting on January 30, all EU members are to amend their constitutions to introduce a balanced-budget rule that caps annual structural deficits at 0.5% of GDP.
This ceiling can be raised only in a deep depression or other exceptional circumstances, allowing for counter-cyclical policy so long as it is agreed that the additional deficit is cyclical, rather than structural.
Otherwise, violations would automatically trigger fines of up to 0.1% of GDP.
The UK is one of two EU countries (alongside the Czech Republic) that refused to sign this “fiscal compact,” acceptance of which is required to gain access to European bailout funds.
But Britain’s government has the identical aim of reducing its current deficit of 10% of GDP to near zero in five years.
An argument commonly heard in support of such policies is that the “bond vigilantes” will demand nothing less.
And the finances of some European governments (and Latin American governments in the recent past) have been so parlous that this reaction is understandable.
But that is not true of the US or the UK, which both have large fiscal deficits.
And most countries were adhering to reasonably tight fiscal discipline before the crisis of 2008 undermined their banks, cut their tax revenues, and forced up their sovereign debt.
At the same time, we should not attribute current enthusiasm for fiscal retrenchment to such contingencies.
At its heart lies the belief that all government spending above a necessary minimum is wasteful.
Europe has its own Tea Party crackpots who loathe the welfare state and want it abolished or radically pared, and who are convinced that all state-sponsored capital spending is a “boondoggle” – just so many roads, bridges, and railway lines to nowhere that soak up their money in corruption and inefficiency.
Those who believe this are unfazed by the corruption and waste that characterizes much private-sector spending.
And they prefer the total waste of letting millions of people sit idle (Brock reckons that 16% of the American workforce is unemployed, underemployed, or too discouraged to seek work) to the possibly partial waste of programs that put them to work, nurture their skills, and equip the country with assets.
One can criticize details of Brock’s case: a deeper understanding of Keynes would have given him a more persuasive response to the objection that, if state-financed projects were worth doing, the private sector would be doing them.
Before long, we will have to provide answers to these questions, because the pre-slump fiscal rules that the Europeans are vainly trying to strengthen were not up to the job.
We are far from having worked out a post-recession theory of macroeconomic policy, but certain elements are clear.
In the future, fiscal and monetary policy will have to work together: neither on its own can stabilize inherently unstable market economies.
Monetary policy will have to do much more than it did before 2008 to restrain financial markets’ “irrational exuberance.”
And we need a new, unambiguous system of fiscal accounting that distinguishes between tax-funded government spending and public spending that pays for itself.
Above all, we need to recognize that the state’s role goes beyond maintaining external security and domestic law and order.
As Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations:
“The third and last duty of the sovereign....is that of erecting and maintaining those public institutions and those public works, which though they may be in the highest degree advantageous to a great society, are, however, of such a nature, that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual, or small number of individuals; and which it, therefore, cannot be expected that any individual, or small number of individuals, should erect or maintain.”
Chief among these public works, for Smith, are those that “facilitate the commerce of any country, such as good roads, bridges, navigable canals, harbors, etc.”
Another piece of forgotten knowledge that Smith also mentions is the importance of education.
He is right to do so, however much today’s deficit hawks seem, by their behavior, to prove the opposite.
Goodbye to “Globalization”
FLORENCE – The term “globalization” first swept the world in the 1990’s and reached its highpoint of popularity in 2000 and 2001.
In 2001, for instance, Le Monde contained more than 3,500 references to mondialisation.
But then the figure steadily fell – more than 80% by 2006.
Since the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007, the word’s usage in major newspapers such as the New York Times and the Financial Times has fallen still further.
Globalization is on its way out.
A brief history of the concept, and a comparison with another term that also became discredited by overuse, helps to explain what happened.
The twentieth century’s two most important conceptual innovations, “totalitarianism” and “globalization,” were originally Italian.
The first term defined the tumultuous middle of the twentieth century, the latter its benign ending.
“Totalitarianism” finally disintegrated in 1989, and globalization prevailed.
Both terms originated as criticisms that were supposed to undermine and subvert the political tendencies they described.
But both ended up being just as frequently and enthusiastically used by the respective tendencies’ proponents.
“Totalitarianism” began its conceptual life in 1923 as a criticism or parody by the liberal writer Giovanni Amendola of the megalomaniacal pretensions of Benito Mussolini’s new regime.
In the course of a few years, it had become the proud self-definition of Italian fascism, endorsed by Mussolini’s education minister, Giovanni Gentile, who became the official philosopher of fascism, and then incorporated in a ghost-written article by Mussolini himself in the Encyclopedia of Fascism.
In both the hostile and the celebratory use of the word, totalitarianism was intended to describe a movement that embraced all aspects of life in what purported to be a coherent philosophy of politics, economics, and society.
Fascists liked to think of themselves as imbued with total knowledge and total power.
Today, few know where the term “globalization” originated.
The Oxford English Dictionary gives as the earliest reference to its current usage an academic article from 1972.
The word had been used earlier, but in a rather different sense.
It was a diplomatic term conveying the linkage between disparate policy areas (for example, in negotiating simultaneously on financial and security matters).
The OED etymology ignores the non-English origins of the term, which can be found in the inventive linguistic terminology of continental European student radicalism.
In 1970, the radical left-wing Italian underground periodical Sinistra Proletaria carried an article entitled “The Process of Globalization of Capitalist Society,” which was a description of IBM, an “organization which presents itself as a totality and controls all its activities towards the goal of profit and ‘globalizes’ all activity in the productive process.”
Because IBM, according to the article, produced in 14 countries and sold in 109, it “contains in itself the globalization (mondializzazione) of capitalist imperialism.”
This obscure left-wing publication is the first known reference to globalization in its contemporary sense.
Since then, the term has had ups and downs. It became increasingly faddish in the 1990’s, but mostly as a term of abuse.
In the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, anti-globalization demonstrations targeted the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Economic Forum, and McDonald’s.
Globalization was seen at this time – as in the vision of the 1960’s Italian leftists – as the exploitation of the world’s poor by a plutocratic and technocratic elite.
But in the 2000’s, the meaning of globalization shifted and began to take on a semi-positive note, in large part because it increasingly looked as if the major winners of globalization included many rapidly growing emerging markets.
Indeed, countries that had previously been described as “under-developed” or “Third World” were becoming incipient global hegemons.
Moreover, many former critics began to recognize global connectedness as a way of solving global problems such as climate change, economic crisis, and poverty.
Historians have started to project globalization backwards.
It is no longer seen only as a story of the capital-market-driven integration of the last two decades of the twentieth century, or even of an “early wave of globalization” in the nineteenth century, when the gold standard and the Atlantic telegram seemed to unite the world.
Instead, the wider and deeper historical vision is of a globalization that encompasses the Roman empire and the Song dynasty, and goes back to the globalization of the human species from a common African origin.
The terms that we use to describe complex political and social phenomena and processes have odd ambiguities.
Some concepts that are designed as criticisms are quickly inverted to become celebratory.
By 2011, anti-globalization rhetoric had largely faded, and globalization is thought of as not something to be neither fought nor cheered, but as a fundamental characteristic of the human story, in which disparate geographies and diverse themes are inextricably intertwined.
In short, globalization has lost its polemical bite, and with that loss, its attractions as a concept have faded.
Goodbye to the Dollar?
CAMBRIDGE – As the world’s financial leaders meet in Washington this month at the World Bank-International Monetary Fund annual meeting, perhaps they should be glad there is no clear alternative to the dollar as the global currency standard.
If the euro were fully ready for prime time, we might well be seeing it’s dollar exchange rate jump to over 2.00, and not just to 1.65 or 1.70, as it seems poised to do anyway.
You can’t treat your customers as badly as the United States has done lately if they can go elsewhere.
Over the past six years, the value of the trade-weighted dollar has fallen by more than a quarter, as the US has continued to rack up historically unprecedented trade deficits.
With a soft economy, a badly compromised financial system, and serious concerns about rising inflation, the long-term dollar trend is downward, however the current crisis ends.
And it is not over.
The Federal Reserve’s bailout of the financial system is unlikely to stand up unless banks find fresh capital, and lots of it.
Ultra-rich sovereign wealth funds have the cash to rescue US banks. But they are unlikely to want to do so at this point, even if the US political system allowed it.
Instead, as the credit crunch and housing price decline continue, an epic mortgage bailout appears increasingly likely, possibly costing US taxpayers a trillion dollars or more.
The problem is that after so many years of miserable returns on dollar assets, will global investors really be willing to absorb another trillion dollars in US debt at anything near current interest rates and exchange rates?
US debt hardly looks like a bargain right now, even without the sinking dollar.
Far-flung military misadventures continue to stretch the country’s fiscal resources, with costs potentially running into many trillions of dollars, according a recent study by Linda Bilmes and Joseph Stiglitz.
Next year will almost certainly see a massive rise in US corporate defaults, even though many firms entered the recession with relatively strong balance sheets.
State and municipal finances are in even worse shape.
With tax revenues collapsing due to falling home prices and incomes, dozens of US municipalities could well go into receivership, as New York City did in the 1970’s.
US municipal bonds are already trading at huge risk premia, and the first big government default hasn’t even hit yet.
Of course, if the dollar were to fall off its perch as the world’s dominant currency any time soon, the euro would be the only serious alternative.
The Yuan may well supplant the dollar in the second half of this century.
But China’s draconian capital controls and massive financial repression currently disqualify it from anchoring the global economic system.
Fortunately for the dollar, the euro, too, seems to have its problems.
European banks remain balkanized, with a patchwork of national regulators seeking to promote their own champions.
European governments’ debt may all be denominated in euro, but German and Italian debt are hardly the same thing, so the government euro-bond market lacks the depth and liquidity of the US Treasury Bill market.
Moreover, international investors can buy and sell real estate far more easily in the US than in most of Europe.
And the absence of a Europe-wide fiscal policy creates significant uncertainty about how the European Central Bank would finance itself if it suddenly faced large losses on junk bank debt after a big bailout.
But the euro does have growing strengths.
At current market exchange rates, the European Union is now larger economically than the US.
New central and eastern European members are bringing enormous dynamism and flexibility.
At the same time, the ECB has gained considerable credibility from its handling of the global credit crisis.
Indeed, if the euro zone can persuade Great Britain to become a full-fledged member, thereby acquiring one of the world’s two premier financial centers (London), the euro might really start to look like a viable alternative to the dollar.
In 1971, as the dollar collapsed towards the end of the post-World War II fixed exchange-rate system, US Treasury Secretary John Connally famously told his foreign counterparts that “the dollar is our currency, but your problem.”
And the dollar’s exalted global status has survived ever since, despite many episodes of neglect and abuse.
World currency standards have enormous inertia.
The British pound only forfeited its role to the US dollar after more than 50 years of industrial decline and two world wars.
But it could happen a lot faster this time.
As central bankers and finance ministers ponder how to intervene to prop up the dollar, they should also start thinking about what to do when the time comes to pull the plug.
Good Governance Begins At Home
The whole sorry Wolfowitz affair looks like it is finally drawing to a close.
It is hard to believe that he will stay on much longer at the World Bank, and it is time to start thinking more closely about the future of that institution.
From the first, I was critical of the way he was chosen because I have long opposed the “old boy” agreement between the United States and Europe, by which the US always appoints the head of the World Bank and Europe the head of the IMF.
This unspoken arrangement dates from the founding of the Bretton Woods institution at a time when colonialism was still alive, and makes no sense in the twenty-first century.
There are reports that European leaders have told the US that if they get Wolfowitz to step down quickly and quietly, they will be allowed to choose Wolfowitz’s successor.
It’s easy to see why the US and Europe want to stick to business as usual, but such a deal would amount to a wasted opportunity.
I can think of no better way to restore confidence in these two venerable institutions than to finally open up the way their presidents are selected.
One of the lessons of the Wolfowitz debacle is that it does actually matter how stakeholders and employees feel about the Bank’s leadership.
The world was prejudiced against him from the start because of his involvement in the Iraq War.
But people were willing to give him a chance.
Some said that perhaps he would be another Robert McNamara, the US defense secretary who helped mire America in the Vietnam War, but used his service to the Bank as penance.
At first, there was reason for hope: Wolfowitz was forceful in arguing for debt forgiveness and an end to agricultural subsidies.
But he also hired old friends and political allies – many of whom did not have experience in development – and sealed himself off from his staff, alienating the very people whose support he needed.
As we learned from the case of Larry Summers at Harvard, relationships inside institutions (not just with donors and funders) matter.
In this respect, Wolfowitz, while by all accounts an intelligent and pleasant person, did not do himself any favors.
Worse, Wolfowitz did not seem to have a grand vision for the Bank. Instead of a development strategy, there was simply an expansion of the anti-corruption agenda initiated by his predecessor, James Wolfensohn.
As the World Bank’s Chief Economist under Wolfensohn, I had argued that failing to deal with corruption risked undermining growth and poverty alleviation.
By the time I left the Bank, these ideas were widely accepted, and I was pleased that Wolfowitz supported continuing the Bank’s efforts.
But the fight against corruption was always to be only one part of a more comprehensive development agenda that was required.
Indeed, aid effectiveness could be undermined just as much by incompetence as by corruption.
Sadly, the anti corruption agenda of the Bank became politicized.
There was a push to give money to Iraq – a country rife with corruption – while other countries were accused of corruption without adequate hard evidence or specific details.
And here, too, an opportunity was lost.
The aims of the campaign were laudable, but it generated hostility and ill will, undermining its effectiveness.
The World Bank, in its efforts to support democracy and good governance, must insist on the highest standards of due process: charges of corruption should be treated seriously, and the evidence turned over to national authorities for use in open, transparent, and independent proceedings.
This is something for Wolfowitz’s successor to bear in mind.
If anti-corruption campaigns are to be seen as effective, they must be fair and transparent.
The same is true of the selection of the World Bank’s president.
There is still a chance to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
What has been a sad and sorry saga could have a happy ending if Wolfowitz’s successor is chosen in an open, transparent process.
This, one hopes, is the silver lining in the cloud now hanging over the World Bank.
Goodluck Nigeria
LAGOS – The bombs that exploded in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, as the country was celebrating its golden jubilee earlier this month are a disturbing portent of the unprecedented political territory that the country is entering.
The death last May of Umaru Yar’Adua, Nigeria’s president, upended the informal agreement between members of the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to rotate power between northern Muslims and their southern, mainly Christian counterparts.
Yar’Adua’s deputy, Goodluck Jonathan, from the oil-rich Niger Delta in the south, overcame resistance from members of the late president’s cabinet and was sworn in as Yar’Adua’s successor, as stipulated by the constitution.
In September, he told Nigerians of his intention to run for another presidential term in 2011.
President Jonathan’s announcement triggered furious protests from his northern rivals, including Ibrahim Babangida, a former military dictator who reminded him that Olusegun Obasanjo, a southerner, had served as president from 1999, when military rule ended, to 2007, with northern support.
Yar’Adua had completed only three years of his first four-year term when he died, and it was expected that all southerners, including Jonathan, would unite behind another northerner for next year’s vote.
But resentment of northerners’ perceived dominance of national politics runs deep in the south, particularly in the Niger Delta, where 50 years of uncontrolled oil production has resulted in polluted farmlands and deepening poverty.
The ethnic minority groups that inhabit the area complain that the current revenue-allocation formula, which leaves Nigeria’s oil-producing states with only 13% of oil revenue, is grossly unfair and insufficient compensation for the damaged ecology they endure.
In January 2006, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), a violent organization led by angry Delta youth, began to attack oil installations and the soldiers guarding them.
MEND and other local groups are demanding that the country return to “true federalism” in the spirit of 1960, and that 50% of oil revenue be retained by the region’s inhabitants.
Ken Saro-Wiwa, a writer and founder of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), a grassroots movement in Ogoniland, had called for this as well, before he was hanged by General Sani Abacha’s junta in 1995.
Leading voices in the region have come out strongly in Jonathan’s support, and have asked him to ignore northern politicians who insist that the PDP’s power rotation arrangement be respected.
Delta leaders point out that 2011 is the ‘minorities’ turn to govern the country after being sat upon by the larger ethnic groups since the end of colonial rule in 1960.
It is not yet clear whether Goodluck Jonathan will be able to translate this sectional support into enough votes in the party primaries and beyond to retain the presidency.
He has the advantage of a massive war chest, given that Nigeria’s leaders have always done with the public treasury what they liked.
But General Babangida also has deep pockets.
Besides, PDP’s powerful governors, in control of 28 of the country’s 36 states, see Jonathan as an upstart who came from the middle of nowhere to become president.
The powers of the Nigerian presidency are extensive, and Jonathan’s handlers have been dropping loud hints that they will deploy them to whip the governors – including the northerners – into line.
Northern PDP leaders, still pressuring the region’s large group of presidential contenders, including Babangida, to agree on who will fight it out with Jonathan, are already looking beyond the primaries.
They are threatening to take the northern vote to another party if they lose the PDP ticket.
This could have far-reaching consequences for the PDP and the country. The PDP, in power since military rule ended in 1999, is widely disliked.
Corruption is widespread, and PDP politicians have been unable to deliver the prosperity and improved social services that Nigerians looked forward to following the return of democracy.
Indeed, the PDP has been able to retain power only by rigging successive elections, most spectacularly in 2007, when the outgoing Obasanjo foisted Yar’Adua on the party hierarchy.
The poorly resourced opposition could benefit if the expected northern backlash divides the PDP.
Nuhu Ribadu, the respected former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, has announced his intention to contest the presidency as the candidate of one of the opposition parties.
A Muslim northerner, Ribadu enjoys the support of youth and democrats nationwide.
The latter are regaining confidence in the political process, following the recent appointment of a no-nonsense academic as head of the election commission.
Muhammadu Buhari, whom Babangida replaced as military head of state in 1985, is also expected to run, as the nominee of the Congress of Progressive Change.
Doubts linger about whether longtime northern PDP leaders, used to cutting midnight deals with their southern counterparts, would break ranks and support Ribadu next year.
Conservative northerners also view Buhari, an ascetic politician popular with the region’s poor, with unease.
Even if they overcome their reservations and back Ribadu or Buhari, and either candidate goes on to beat Jonathan at the polls, angry Delta youths could respond with fresh violence against oil workers, disrupting production.
Other trouble spots – central Nigeria, where ethnic tensions are simmering, and the far north, the stomping ground of Boko Haram, a violent Muslim sect – could get sucked into election-related violence.
With industries collapsing because of constant power outages, unemployment soaring, and cynical politicians forcing their impoverished followers into ethnic and religious laagers, Nigeria’s 2011 elections are shaping up to be a perfect storm.
In the past, Nigeria has always managed to weather its political tempests.
Will it do so again?
Good Policies for Great Countries
NEW YORK – We are in a protracted period of international transition, one that began more than two decades ago with the Cold War’s end.
That era of strategic rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union gave way to one in which the US possessed far greater power than any other country and enjoyed an unprecedented degree of influence.
That American unipolar moment has given way to a world better described as non-polar, in which power is widely distributed among nearly 200 states and tens of thousands of non-state actors ranging from Al Qaeda to Al Jazeera and from Goldman Sachs to the United Nations.
But what distinguishes historical eras from one another is less the distribution of power than the degree of order between and within states.
Order never just emerges; it is the result of conscious efforts by the most powerful entities in the world.
While the US remains the world’s most powerful single country, it cannot maintain, much less expand, international peace and prosperity on its own.
It is over-extended, dependent upon massive daily imports of dollars and oil, and its armed forces are engaged in demanding conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The US lacks the means and the political consensus to take on much more in the way of global responsibility. It also lacks the means to compel others to follow its lead.
Moreover, contemporary problems – for example, thwarting the spread of materials and weapons of mass destruction, maintaining an open world economy, slowing climate change, and combating terrorism – cannot be managed, much less solved, by any single country.
Only collective efforts can meet common challenges; the more global the response, the more likely that it will succeed.
In short, the US requires partners if the twenty-first century is to be an era in which the majority of people around the world enjoy relative peace and satisfactory standards of living.
But the partnerships that prevailed in the Cold War – between the US, Western Europe, and several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia – are no longer adequate.
These countries lack the resources and often the will to manage most of the world’s problems.
So the old partners need new ones.
Emerging powers have the potential to fill this need.
The question is what China, India, Brazil, and others are prepared to do with their growing strength.
What makes a country great is not the size of its territory, population, army, or economy, but how it uses its power to shape the world beyond its borders.
Countries that are strong but still developing tend to regard foreign policy as little more than a hand-maiden of domestic policy and a means to gain access to markets and resources essential for rapid development.
This outlook is understandable, but shortsighted.
Rising powers can neither insulate nor isolate themselves from what happens beyond their borders.
Whether or not they acknowledge it, they have a stake in world order.
Consider China, by many measures the most significant emerging country.
It wants to maintain preferred access to Iran’s energy resources, but if conflict results from Iran’s nuclear aspirations, China will be paying much more for those resources.
The prospect of a threat to the stability of the greater Middle East and to the flow of oil should give China an incentive to support robust sanctions against Iran.
But it is not clear whether China’s leaders will recognize this and act in their country’s own long-term self interest.
The point is not to single out China. Similar questions apply to India and Brazil.
And it is not just the developing and emerging countries that must reconsider their approach to the world. The US must do so as well.
While much has been said and written about America’s call for China to become a global stakeholder, China will not simply sign on as a pillar of an American-defined world.
It wants to help set the rules and build the institutions for enforcing them.
It is up to the US to work with China and others to do this, and this requires America’s openness to others’ preferences and their having a larger role.
The empowerment of the G-20 is a step in the right direction, but many more changes are needed, including restructuring the UN, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank so that they, too, reflect the new distribution of power.
In return, new arrangements should call on emerging countries to contribute more to addressing climate change, paying for peacekeeping and state-building, promoting free trade, and sanctioning those who support terror or develop weapons of mass destruction.
This era’s major states, developed and emerging alike, have the ability to reach accord on today’s defining issues.
Their willingness to do so will determine when and how this period of global transition ends and what succeeds it.
Good Times Down Latin America’s Way
MEXICO CITY – For Latin America, 2011 was, in Frank Sinatra’s terms, a very good year – and 2012 doesn’t look like being so bad either.
For a region not always accustomed to things going well, this is a somewhat strange state of affairs.
Three elections were held in Latin America in 2011.
Two – in Argentina and Peru – went well; the other – in Nicaragua – was marred by egregious fraud and heavy-handed government intervention in favor of the incumbent.
Still, two out of three is not bad in a region where, previously, if elections were held at all, disputes about the outcomes were the norm.
In economic terms, high commodity prices fueled strong growth in South America in 2011, and the modest US recovery benefited nearby countries.
In Chile, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, and, to a lesser extent, Brazil and Colombia, voracious Chinese and Indian demand for raw materials and food boosted foreign reserves, enabled heavy government spending, and sustained high levels of imports.
All this led to average growth rates well in excess of 4%.
But it also led to new doubts about the wisdom of reliance on commodity exports.
Chilean economist and politician Carlos Ominami, in his tell-all memoir Secretos de la Concertación, wondered what would happen if China's economy slowed or its real-estate bubble burst.
By the end of the year, this seemed to be happening: commodity prices and growth rates were dropping, and 2012, while still promising strong economic performance, will not match this year's success.
Sustained lower prices may bring chickens home to roost.
The outliers were Venezuela, despite high oil prices, and the Caribbean Basin: Mexico, Central America, and the islands.
These countries export manufactured goods to the US, on which they also rely for tourism and remittances; they lack either the geography or the geology to become great commodity exporters (or, like Mexico, they export all of their oil to the US).
But even the outliers enjoyed decent growth this year.
If the US avoids a new slowdown, they may do better than South America in 2012.
All told, with the exception of 2009, the entire region will have experienced a full decade of uninterrupted growth – something not witnessed since the 1970’s.
The boom fueled expansion of Latin America’s middle classes.
Between 1950 and 1980, most Latin American countries’ middle classes comprised between one-quarter and one-third of the population.
Then came the debt crisis of the 1980’s, the extreme structural reforms and financial collapses of the 1990’s, and a new global downturn in 2001.
Such traumatic events plunged these countries into the so-called “middle-income trap”: unable to grow nor to continue broadening their middle classes.
But, by the second half of the 2000’s, everything changed: prolonged macroeconomic stability, competent center-left or center-right governments, sensible social policies, and global economic growth allowed countries like Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and even Argentina to take the next giant step.
By 2008 or so, around 55% of these countries’ populations belonged to the middle class, by whatever definition one used.
Access to credit, more jobs, remittances, the commodity boom, and conditional cash transfers enabled millions to purchase a home, a car, and a better life.
This was not a middle class modeled on North Atlantic precedents, and its members’ status is precarious and reversible; moreover, their standard of living is well below that of their counterparts in wealthier countries.
But a middle class it is.
These middle-income sectors make up an even larger part of the electorate, since their turnout rates are higher than those of the poor.
Political candidates must engage them, occasionally pander to them, and tailor their message to them, all of which steers leaders and parties toward moderate positions.
There are no guarantees that this will endure, but it is one of the region’s most impressive achievements in recent years.
Latin America will witness two important elections in 2012, in Venezuela and Mexico, and one non-election, in Cuba.
In Venezuela, President Hugo Chávez’s opponents will unite behind a single candidate for October’s presidential election.
But everything depends on Chávez’s health, which, like that of Fidel Castro in Cuba a closely guarded state secret.
Will Chávez’s cancer allow him to run (he is as formidable a campaigner as he is a terrible economic manager), win, and govern until 2030?
Will he be a stand-in for his more radical brother (and designated successor), Adán?
Or will he be too ill to participate?
In that case – and most importantly – would he, Adán, and the entire “Bolivarian” elite accept defeat at the polls?
In Cuba, there will be no elections, but matters may come to a head next year.
Raúl Castro’s economic reforms have either not been implemented, or are not delivering the expected results; the island continues to depend on Venezuelan subsidies, remittances from Miami, and European tourists.
Cuba’s octogenarian ruling brothers cannot last forever.
Something may have to give on the island, especially if their Venezuelan benefactor is no longer in power.
Then there is Mexico, which will hold only its fourth democratic election in its history in a context of rampant organized crime, appalling violence, and rising skepticism about President Felipe Calderón’s war on drugs.
With three contending parties, a terrible electoral law, no run-off, and condiderable frustration with 12 years of center-right, often ineffective governments, the outcome is highly uncertain.
That said, Mexico’s political institutions have survived hard times, the middle class rejects extremism, and the US is close by.
One would prefer to see Mexico’s presidential candidates offer platforms with ideas and proposals that respond to the challenges facing the country, but this substance deficit occurs everywhere now, almost all the time.
For a region that has suffered so long from frustration and despair over its failures, these are among the best of times.
Latin America should count its blessings, and remember that nothing lasts forever.
The Tinkerer’s Apprentice
BERLIN – The best inventions are never finished.
When the German engineer Karl Benz invented the first petroleum-powered automobile, he did not just create an engine with wheels; he set in motion an industry that revolutionized the way society was structured.
Similarly, the English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee did not only build the world’s first Web site. He laid the groundwork for the World Wide Web.
Neither could have anticipated the impact of what he was doing.
If there is one lesson that economic policymakers should heed in 2015 and beyond, it is this: Just as invention is dynamic, so are the industries it creates.
As we learned in 2014, it is a lesson that has yet to sink in entirely.
When Google was launched, people were amazed that they were able to find out about almost anything by typing just a few words into a computer.
The engineering behind it was technically complicated, but what you got was pretty rough: a page of text, broken up by ten blue links.
It was better than anything else, but not great by today’s standards.
So our co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin – like all other successful inventors – kept iterating.
They started with images.
After all, people wanted more than just text.
This first became apparent after the 2000 Grammy Awards, where Jennifer Lopez wore a green dress that, well, caught the world’s attention.
At the time, it was the most popular search query we had ever seen.
But we had no surefire way of getting users exactly what they wanted: J­Lo wearing that dress.
Google Image Search was born.
Maps are another great example.
When people search Google for an address, they do not want a link to Web sites that mention the street.
They usually want to know how to get there.
So we built a map that was clickable, draggable, and easy to explore.
Maps have become such an integral part of Google that most users probably cannot imagine it without them.
It has been the same with many of our changes.
Our searches have gotten better over time.
Google the weather where you live and you will get the forecast for the next few days as the top result, saving you time and effort.
But Google’s efforts to provide direct answers to questions have fueled complaints at the European Commission.
Companies like Expedia, Yelp, and TripAdvisor argue that Google searches are depriving their Web sites of valuable traffic, putting their businesses at a disadvantage.
Instead of us providing you with images, maps, the weather, news, or translated versions of foreign-language sites, they would rather go back to ten blue links.
A few years ago, a lawyer for one of our competitors drew a picture of a coastline with a little island offshore.
He added a dotted line, explaining that this was the only ferry connecting the island to the mainland.
His point was that Google was just like the ferry: the only way to navigate the Internet.
In reality, there are many ways to get around on the Web.
For news, you might go directly to your favorite news service.
If you want to buy something, you might go directly to Zalando or Amazon, where you can research models and prices, get reviews, and pay for your purchase all at once.
The real point is that the economic landscape in which we are operating is not only competitive; it is changing constantly.
This year, our industry reached an important milestone.
For the first time, people are spending more time on mobile devices than on their desktop computers.
Time spent on desktops has now fallen to just 40%.
And people use mobile devices very differently from the way they use desktops.
Seven out of every eight minutes spent on a mobile phone is spent within an app, and the most popular app in the world is Facebook.
Many people look at Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon, among others, as companies that no competitor could ever beat.
I am less certain.
History is full of examples that show that size and past success guarantee nothing.
Great companies can be surpassed swiftly.
Just a few years ago, companies like Yahoo, Nokia, Microsoft, and Blackberry seemed unrivaled.
They have all since been disrupted by a new wave of tech companies – Google among them.
Google works very differently from other companies that have been dubbed “gatekeepers” and that are regulated accordingly.
We are not a ferry, a railroad, a telecommunications network, or an electricity grid with only one line serving you and no competitors allowed.
No one is stuck using Google.
People have choices, and they exercise them all the time.
We know that if we cease to be useful, our users will leave.
The barriers to entry are negligible, because competition is just one click away.
Someone in a garage somewhere is gunning for us, and 2015 could be the year that they make their move.
I know, because not long ago we were in that garage.
And I know that the next Google will not do what Google does, just as Google did not do what AOL did.
The upheavals resulting from momentous technological change are rarely expected.
The telegraph disrupted the postal service.
Radio and television shook up the newspaper industry.
Airplanes ended the age of ocean liners.
Inventions are always dynamic; that is why the future will always be as exciting as the past.
The Health Costs of Tax Reform
NEW YORK – The sweeping tax bill that US President Donald Trump signed into law on December 22, 2017, may have been presented as an early Christmas gift.
But to the millions of Americans whose health outcomes will worsen as a result, the legislation looks more like a costly white elephant.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act targets health care in the United States in three major ways. First, it eliminates the individual mandate, a provision of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) that imposes a tax penalty on people who go without health insurance.
According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), this repeal alone will reduce the number of insured Americans by 13 million over the next decade, and increase average health-insurance premiums by about 10%.
Moreover, eliminating the individual mandate could disrupt health-insurance markets, because there will be fewer younger, healthier people purchasing insurance.
Second, the CBO estimates that the law will add $1.45 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, which could trigger spending cuts to health-insurance programs for the elderly, poor, and disabled, such as Medicare and Medicaid.
These programs are already some of the government’s largest budget items, accounting for $1 trillion in spending – 26% of the federal budget – in 2016.
Any cuts to them made in the name of deficit reduction will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable.
Third, the tax law will decrease consumer health-care spending and adversely affect health outcomes among poor and at-risk populations.
Although the law was sold as a tax “cut,” it will actually reduce the after-tax income of some 53% of Americans, while boosting the incomes of the richest 5%.
According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, an independent body that evaluates tax proposals before Congress, Americans earning more than $1 million per year will see their annual tax bill fall by an average of $12,865 over the next decade.
For the poorest Americans, however, the tax burden will rise during this period.
Those earning less than $10,000 per year will be subject to an average annual tax hike of $152, and those earning $10,000-$20,000 per year will face an average annual increase of $2,563.
Income has a huge impact on health outcomes.
A 2016 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that American men with incomes in the top 1% live 15 years longer than the poorest 1%; for women in these respective groups, the gap is ten years.
The tax law could worsen these disparities by lowering the incomes of low- and middle-income Americans, many of whom are already living shorter lives, owing partly to the opioid crisis that is ravaging much of the country.
In 2016, for example, life expectancy fell for the second consecutive year, by 0.1 years, to 78.6.
Because the poor, unemployed, and uninsured suffer disproportionately from opioid abuse and addiction, the tax law puts their health further at risk.
Falling incomes and rising deficits could translate into less stable health-insurance markets and cuts to Medicaid, which reimburses prescriptions for naloxone, a drug used to reverse opioid overdoses.
Evidence from two of the states that have been hit hardest by the opioid epidemic is sobering.
Last year, researchers at Harvard University found that in Massachusetts, which has expanded its Medicaid coverage in recent years, 868 opioid-related deaths were averted in 2016, whereas only 11 opioid-related deaths were averted in Tennessee, which did not expand its Medicaid program.
The researchers concluded that, “Medicaid expansion helped put more purchasing power into the hands of laypersons and in so doing, expanded the use of naloxone, thereby saving lives.”
Each of the tax law’s injustices – fewer Americans with health coverage, stripped-down public programs, lower incomes for the poor, less access to substance-abuse treatment – is unambiguously bad for health outcomes.
Taken together, they will have an adverse effect on worker productivity, thus undermining overall economic growth.
Some argue that the CBO’s initial forecast of the impact of repealing the individual mandate was overly dire, and that many Americans will purchase insurance even in the absence of a penalty.
And, to be sure, there is no guarantee that spending for Medicare and Medicaid will be cut, given that the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare has made the program even more popular among those it serves.
But even if these two assumptions prove to be unfounded, the unintended consequences of the new tax law will still threaten Americans’ wellbeing.
The bill was rushed through Congress and signed into law without any meaningful debate about its potential effects on health care.
As the law’s provisions take effect, policymakers must start paying closer attention.
Otherwise, the legislation could end up costing Americans something more valuable than money: their health.
Educating Everyone
EDINBURGH – The odds are weighed heavily against achieving the target set by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of ensuring by December 2015 that every school-age child is actually in school.
With children in Gaza, Syria, Iraq, and Nigeria literally in the firing line in recent months, the immense scale of the challenge could not be more apparent.
After all, fulfilling the promise of universal education demands that even those in the most difficult circumstances, such as child refugees and children in combat zones, can safely acquire a basic education.
Academic research suggests that no country can enjoy sustained prosperity – and none can avoid the middle-income trap – without large-scale investment in high-quality education.
This is particularly true for today’s knowledge-based economy, in which companies value themselves according to their human, not just physical, assets, and stock exchanges assess intellectual, in addition to physical, capital.
Education has long been viewed as the number one guarantor of income, wealth, status, and security.
Yet millions of people have consistently been left out or left behind, with nearly half of the world’s children still lacking access to basic education.
To be sure, for the first five years after the MDGs were introduced, significant progress was made, with enrollment in primary and lower-secondary schools increasing by 1.5% annually.
On that trajectory, the enrollment rate would have reached 97% worldwide by 2022, with Sub-Saharan Africa reaching that level by 2026.
But, after 2005, progress stalled.
As a result, only 36% of children in the world’s poorest countries complete lower-secondary schooling.
By 2030, that rate will have increased, but only to 54%.
Unsurprisingly, girls in rural communities face the biggest obstacles.
Today, some three-quarters of girls do not receive basic primary education; in 2030, half will still be missing out.
Likewise, some 90% of girls today are unable to complete secondary education; by 2030, that figure will have declined by only 20%.
And, whereas boys in Sub-Saharan Africa will have to wait until 2069 for universal access to primary education, girls will have to wait until 2086.
As for lower-secondary education, it will take almost a century, if current trends persist, to ensure access for all girls in Sub-Saharan Africa.
None of this squares with global leaders’ promise to develop the talents of all of the world’s children.
A recent study indicates that Africa is so far behind in terms of educational opportunity that in 2025 just 2% of young adults in their early thirties in Rwanda, Chad, Liberia, and Malawi – and only 3% in Tanzania and Benin – will have a college or university education.
Such low levels of tertiary education make it impossible not only to hire qualified teachers for the next generation, but also to staff medical centers and clinics with fully trained health professionals – failures that perpetuate the seemingly endless cycle of poor education, bad health, unemployment, and poverty.
Of course, a few African countries – such as Algeria, Nigeria, and Egypt – might manage to buck the trend.
But even in South Africa – currently Africa’s most advanced country – 10% of young adults, at most, will have college or university degrees by 2045.
Meanwhile, in Pakistan, a bold education campaign led by Malala Yousafzai is helping to increase the share of young adults with a tertiary education, which stood at a measly 7% in 2010.
But the gains are slight; even by 2045, the share is unlikely to exceed 15%.
Nepal is expected to experience faster growth in tertiary education, but its lower base means that the 2045 level will likely be around 16%.
Even a major emerging economy like India will progress by only 11% from 2010 to 2045, reaching just 23% – far below the level suggested by the global reputation of its institutions of higher education.
Meanwhile, in Singapore, South Korea, and Japan, the share of young adults with college or university degrees will reach 80-90%.
The assumption that economic development and technological progress will inevitably expand opportunities for all is little more than wishful thinking.
In reality, unless a concerted effort is made, the distribution of educational – and thus economic – opportunity will become increasingly unequal in the coming years.
But the real divide is not between the educated and the uneducated; it is between those with access to education and those who want it.
These long-neglected people will continue pressing governments and international organizations until every person’s fundamental right to education is respected.
And the next stop in their campaign is the United Nations General Assembly in New York, with hundreds of young people, representing all countries, gathering to demand change from world leaders.
As school doors reopen around the world, the international community should renew its commitment to ensuring that every child, everywhere, has a chance to walk through them.
Education Without Borders
LONDON – As the third anniversary of the start of Syria’s civil war approaches, there is a race against time to deliver a groundbreaking education project to the conflict’s hardest-hit victims – hundreds of thousands of child refugees.
A shocking three million Syrian children have now been displaced. More than one million of them have fled Syria and are languishing in camps in neighboring countries, particularly Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey.
These children are now suffering a third winter away from their homes, schools, and friends.
Many are separated from their families, and thousands more join the ranks of displaced persons every day in what is becoming the largest humanitarian catastrophe of our time.
But a pathbreaking initiative in Lebanon, involving teachers, aid agencies, and education charities has opened a small window of hope.
Amid the chaos of camps, makeshift huts, and destitution, the fight for an important new principle of international aid has begun: even in times of conflict, children must have access to education.
A century and a half ago, the Red Cross established the norm that health care could – and should – be provided even in conflict zones.
This principle was carried forward by groups like Médicins sans Frontières, whose doctors have risked their lives for the last four decades to deliver medical care to the world’s most dangerous places.
Now Lebanon is the site of a pilot program to advance the idea that providing education for refugee children is equally feasible – and no less important.
Across 1,500 communities in this troubled, divided country, where Syrian refugee children now make up 20% of the school-age population, the aim is to establish children’s right to education as a humanitarian priority.
The typical refugee child spends more than ten years away from home.
And every month that a child is out of school makes it less likely that they will ever return.
Three years ago, most Syrian children were at school, and the country had near universal primary education.
Today, millions of children are being denied any chance to realize their talents.
The scars will last for decades.
So, in Syria and the surrounding region, there is already a lost generation in the making: children who are now eight and nine and who have never been to school, children condemned to work as child laborers, and hundreds of girls forced into early marriages.
There are gruesome tales of young people who have been forced to sell their kidneys and other organs simply to survive.
Of course, we must provide food, shelter, and vaccinations.
But, in conflicts like these, the one thing that children need, beyond the material basics, is hope.
And it is education that provides children with hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel – hope that they can plan for the future and prepare for jobs and adulthood.
The pilot project in Lebanon, designed by Kevin Watkins of the United Kingdom’s Overseas Development Institute and led by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), creates the opportunity to establish a right to education irrespective of borders.
Indeed, it is designed to cater to all 435,000 Syrian child refugees now in the country.
Thanks to a historic agreement with the Lebanese government, places for hundreds of thousands of children can be created within weeks by putting 1,500 of Lebanon’s schools on a double-shift system.
The scheme is already being piloted in a small village called Akroum in the north of the country.
Lebanese children are taught during the first shift, and Syrian children in the second.
Using the same school for both sets of pupils means that education can be delivered at a cost of only £400 ($670) per child per year.
To secure places for all refugee children, we are seeking $195 million dollars a year for UNICEF and UNHCR, with the plan to be implemented on the ground by NGOs and the Lebanese authorities.
The aim is to secure all funding during March, as the world marks the third anniversary of this tragic exodus from Syria.
We have already assembled a coalition of ten donor countries to take the lead, but we need ten more donors to fund the project fully.
We are appealing to donors not just to create thousands of school places for desperately needy children, but also to establish a precedent for the 20 million other children driven by violent conflict into displaced-persons camps and shantytowns.
There cannot be universal educational opportunity for the worlds’ children without an agreement that we will cater to children in conflict zones.
One million Afghan children are in camps along the border with Pakistan.
Thousands of children in South Sudan still await their first chance to go to school, and schools have yet to be provided for a million more children in the war-torn Central African Republic.
These children’s chances now depend on showing that we can make progress in Lebanon.
The UN Millennium Development Goals, adopted in 2000, expire in December 2015, which means that time is running to meet the deadline for achieving the target of universal primary education.
That goal will remain unattainable unless and until we establish the long-overdue principle that a child’s right to education knows no boundaries.
One Hundred Days of Servitude
LONDON – Demonstrations around the world were held this week to mark the 100th day of captivity for more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls by the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram.
Since their abduction in April, global outrage has not waned; on the contrary, it has spurred a worldwide movement to uphold all girls’ basic rights.
Campaigners from groups fighting child marriage, child trafficking, and child labor, and from groups demanding children’s right to attend school, free of intimidation, have united in the past few days to show the strength of global opinion in favor of universal education and a world free of child slavery.
But what is of greater long-term significance is that girls themselves are demanding that their rights be taken seriously.
Girls have mobilized in Bangladesh, where the movement to establish child-marriage-free zones is growing; in India, where the Global March Against Child Labor started; and in Africa, where child protection clubs are being formed in almost every country.
The first demand is that the Nigerian girls be returned safely to their homes and that schools in Nigeria are made safer and more secure from threats by Boko Haram (whose name means “Western education is a sin”).
France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China, and Israel have stepped up military and technical support, including the recent provision of helicopters and night-vision equipment for jungle warfare to fight the group, whose campaign of terror has cost 5,000 deaths in the past five years.
In Nigeria alone, six million girls do not attend school; around the world, ten million girls each year become child brides, and seven million school-age girls are full-time workers.
We can no longer assume steady, if rocky, progress toward vindication of girls’ rights.
Iraqi legislators are considering reducing the age for child marriage to nine.
Pakistan’s Council of Islamic Ideology is calling for all age limits on marriage to be abolished.
And India has passed up another chance to outlaw child labor.
The rising tide of adolescent rage at child marriage and child labor has yet to trend on Twitter and Facebook.
And Bangladesh’s child-marriage-free zone in the Nilphamari region, Indonesia’s child-empowerment groups in the districts of Dompu and Grobogan, Uganda’s child-rights clubs, and India’s Bachpan Bachao Andolan, which combats child slavery, may not be household names.
But the yawning gap between what girls are demanding and the opportunities on offer to them is fueling a liberation struggle led by girls themselves.
Last month, on the “Day of the African Child,” thousands of young people marched on the streets of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and took over 20 African and Asian parliaments to demand universal education for girls.
On July 23, girls took to the streets in Pakistan, led by Baela Raza Jamil of Idara-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi, which is campaigning for what the Nigerian schoolgirls have lost: the right to an education.
In India, vigils making common cause with the Chibok girls were led by Bachpan Bachao Andolan, which every day rescues children from trafficking and slave labor.
Girls Not Brides mobilized in 45 countries, reminding its 145 sister organizations around the world that many of the Chibok girls will meet the same fate as the girls they seek to protect.
Increasingly, young people around the world see the connection between the abductions in Nigeria, the rape and murder of young girls in India, so-called “honor killings” of Pakistani girls who marry against their families’ wishes, genital mutilation of girls across Africa, and child-trafficking for full-time work, often in slave-labor conditions.
Seven decades after the adoption by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, girls’ rights are still not taken seriously; so girls are taking action to make themselves heard.
And, slowly but surely, local embryonic civil-rights movements are linking up with global leaders – Girls Not Brides, Walk Free, and A World at School – as part of an emergency coalition to eliminate child labor, child marriage, and educational discrimination against girls.
The timetable for doing so will be set out at the UN General Assembly in September in the presence of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
Girls should be able to study in a classroom, free of fear and without the need to demonstrate on the streets.
This is a basic right; ensuring that it is respected cannot come soon enough.
Putting Education First
LONDON – For far too long, the cause of universal education has taken a back seat to other great international movements for change.
Now, for two new reasons that lie at the heart of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s launch of the “Education First” initiative, education has returned to its rightful place atop the global policy agenda.
First and foremost, young people have themselves become the biggest advocates of universal education for girls and boys.
Refusing to remain silent while denied opportunity, young people – particularly girls – have launched one of the great civil-rights struggles of our time.
Few could remain unmoved by the brave fight of the young Pakistani girl Malala Yousafzai after the Taliban shot her in the head because she insisted on the right of young girls to an education.
Few have failed to notice the massive public outpouring of support in Pakistan and elsewhere for the cause that she is championing.
Likewise, we have also seen in recent months the creation by schoolgirls in Bangladesh of child-marriage-free zones, aimed at defending the right of girls to stay in school instead of being married off as teenage brides against their will.
In India, the Global March Against Child Labor, led by the children’s rights advocate Kailash Satyarthi, has rescued thousands of young boys and girls from a life of slavery in factories, workshops, and domestic service, and has ensured that they return to school.
These demonstrations by girls and boys demanding their right to education have made the fight for basic schooling impossible to ignore.
Consequently, every government now feels under even greater pressure to deliver the second of the global Millennium Development Goals (“achieve universal primary education”) by the end of 2015.
But a second worldwide force also has propelled education to the center of the policy agenda in most countries: the increased recognition of the importance of education by those who examine why countries succeed or fail.
For years, academics have debated whether culture, institutions, ideology, or resources cause some countries to lag behind.
Today, a growing number of writers, researchers, and policymakers see the crucial link between education and national economic success.
The deployment of human capital has become an important factor in explaining why some countries remain stuck in a “middle-income trap” and why others cannot break out of low-income status.
And research assessing a country’s human capital now focuses on the quantity and quality of basic skills, qualified graduate manpower, and expertise in research and development.
Putting education first is urgent in view of the scale of wasted talent and potential worldwide.
Some 57 million children still do not go to school, 500 million girls will never finish the secondary education to which they are entitled, and 750 million adults remain illiterate.
The link between education and economic success makes the delivery of quality schooling and training a hugely important issue for business as well.
By 2020, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, we will face the twin problems of a shortfall of up to 40 million high-skill workers and a surplus of up to 95 million low-skill workers.
By 2030, the global workforce of 3.5 billion will include an estimated one billion workers who lack a secondary education, significantly hindering their countries’ economic prospects.
As a result, without urgent action, businesses are likely to face a huge skills shortage, especially in emerging markets and developing countries, where most economic activity will be concentrated.
Indeed, the adult illiteracy rate in Somalia is 63%, and 39% in Nigeria; in South Sudan, more girls die during childbirth than complete primary school.
Unless we act, by mid-century the global economy will be characterized by massive waste of talent and unequal opportunities.
According to new figures from the Wittgenstein Center’s forthcoming book World Population and Human Capital in the 21st Century, only 3% of young adults in Mali and Mozambique are projected to have a tertiary education in 2050; the expected proportion is just 4% in Niger, Liberia, Rwanda, and Chad, and only 5% in Malawi and Madagascar.
While the projection for North America as a whole is 60%, the forecast for Sub-Saharan Africa is 16%.
Such figures reveal a world divided between those who have and those who lack educational opportunity, with huge potential repercussions not only in terms of skill shortages and economic waste, but also in terms of social stability.
The late US Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren’s words in Brown v. Board of Education,which struck down the legal basis for racial segregation in America’s public schools, remain no less relevant today: “It is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education.”
As Warren put it, “Such an opportunity…is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.”
We have little more than two years to turn basic education from a privilege for some into a right for all.
Secretary-General Ban and I are determined that every day until that deadline in December 2015, we will work as hard as possible to ensure every child is in school.
The War on Education
LONDON – The kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls in northern Nigeria by the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram is beyond outrageous.
Sadly, it is just the latest battle in a savage war being waged against the fundamental right of all children to an education.
That war is global, as similarly horrifying incidents in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Somalia attest.
Around the world, there have been 10,000 violent attacks on schools and universities in the past four years, according to a report by the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack.
The evidence is as ample as it is harrowing, from the 29 schoolboys killed by suspected Boko Haram militants in the Nigerian state of Yobe earlier this year and Somali schoolchildren forced to become soldiers to Muslim boys attacked by ethnic Burmese/Buddhist nationalists in Myanmar and schoolgirls in Afghanistan and Pakistan who have been firebombed, shot, or poisoned by the Taliban for daring to seek an education.
These are not isolated examples of children caught in the crossfire; this is what happens when classrooms become the actual targets of terrorists who see education as a threat.
(Indeed, Boko Haram is literally translated to mean that “false” or “Western” education is “forbidden.”)
In at least 30 countries, there is a concerted pattern of attacks by armed groups, with Afghanistan, Colombia, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, and Syria the worst affected.
Such attacks reveal with stark clarity that providing education is not only about blackboards, books, and curricula.
Schools around the world, from North America to northern Nigeria, now need security plans to ensure the safety of their pupils and provide confidence to parents and their communities.
At the World Economic Forum in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, this week, together with partners from business and civil society, I launched a program to ensure the personal safety of children in areas where the threats to them are real and immediate.
The “Safe Schools Initiative” will combine school and community-based plans with special measures to protect children attending some 5,000 primary and secondary schools in the most vulnerable areas.
For individual schools, the measures will include reinforcing security infrastructure, planning and response, training for staff, and counseling for students and community members.
At the community level, education committees comprising parents, teachers, and volunteers will be formed, along with specially developed teacher-student-parent defense units for rapid response to threats.
Other countries’ experience grappling with similar threats has shown that it is crucial to engage religious leaders formally in promoting and safeguarding education.
In Afghanistan, in collaboration with community shuras and protection committees, respected imams sometimes use their Friday sermons to raise awareness about the importance of education in Islam.
In Peshawar, Pakistan, in a program supported by UNICEF, prominent Muslims leaders have spoken out about the importance of education and of sending students back to school.
In Somalia, religious leaders have gone on public radio in government-controlled areas and visited schools to advocate against the recruitment of child soldiers.
In countries such as Nepal and the Philippines, community-led negotiations have helped to improve security and take politics out of the classroom.
In some communities, diverse political and ethnic groups have come together and agreed to develop “Safe School Zones.”
They have written and signed codes of conduct stipulating what is and is not allowed on school grounds, in order to prevent violence, school closures, and the politicization of education.
In general, the signatory parties have kept their commitments, helping communities to keep schools open, improve the safety of children, and strengthen school administration.
Millions of children remain locked out of school around the world.
This not just a moral crisis; it is also a wasted economic opportunity.
In Africa, for example, education is particularly crucial as the continent’s economies increasingly shift from resource extraction to knowledge-driven industry.
Providing a safe environment for learning is the most fundamental and urgent first step in solving the global education crisis.
Gordon Gekko Reborn
NEW YORK – In the 1987 film Wall Street, the character Gordon Gekko famously declared, “Greed is good.”
His creed became the ethos of a decade of corporate and financial-sector excesses that ended in the late 1980’s collapse of the junk-bond market and the Savings & Loan crisis.
Gekko himself was packed off to prison.
A generation later, the sequel to Wall Street – to be released next month – sees Gekko released from jail and returned to the financial world.
His reappearance comes just as the credit bubble fueled by the sub-prime mortgage boom is about to burst, triggering the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression.
The “Greed is good” mentality is a regular feature of financial crises.
But were the traders and bankers of the sub-prime saga more greedy, arrogant, and immoral than the Gekkos of the 1980’s?
Not really, because greed and amorality in financial markets have been common throughout the ages.
Teaching morality and values in business schools will not tame such behavior, but changing the incentives that reward short-term profits and lead bankers and traders to take excessive risks will.
The bankers and traders of the latest crisis responded rationally to compensation and bonus schemes that allowed them to assume a lot of leverage and ensured large bonuses, but that were almost guaranteed to bankrupt a large number of financial institutions in the end.
To avoid such excesses, it is not enough to rely on better regulation and supervision, for three reasons:
· Smart and greedy bankers and traders will always find ways to circumvent new rules;
· CEOs and boards of directors of financial firms – let alone regulators and supervisors – cannot effectively monitor the risks and behaviors of thousands of separate profit and loss centers in a firm, as each trader and banker is a separate P&L with its own capital at risk;
· CEOs and boards are themselves subject to major conflicts of interest, because they don’t represent the true interest of their firms’ ultimate shareholders.
As a result, any reform of regulation and supervision will fail to control bubbles and excesses unless several other fundamental aspects of the financial system are changed.
First, compensation schemes must be radically altered through regulation, as banks will not do it themselves for fear of losing talented people to competitors.
In particular, bonuses based on medium-term results of risky trades and investments must supplant bonuses based on short-term outcomes.
Second, repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial and investment banking, was a mistake.
The old model of private partnerships – in which partners had an incentive to monitor each other to avoid reckless investments – gave way to one of public companies aggressively competing with each other and with commercial banks to achieve ever-rising profitability, which was achievable only with reckless levels of leverage.
Similarly, the move from a lending model of “originate and hold” to one of “originate and distribute” based on securitization led to a massive transfer of risk.
No player but the last in the securitization chain was exposed to the ultimate credit risk; the rest simply raked in high fees and commissions.
Third, financial markets and financial firms have become a nexus of conflicts of interest that must be unwound.
These conflicts are inbuilt, because firms that engage in commercial banking, investment banking, proprietary trading, market making and dealing, insurance, asset management, private equity, hedge-fund activities, and other services are on every side of every deal (the recent case of Goldman Sachs was just the tip of the iceberg).
There are also massive agency problems in the financial system, because principals (such as shareholders) cannot properly monitor the actions of agents (CEOs, managers, traders, bankers) that pursue their own interest.
Moreover, the problem is not just that long-term shareholders are shafted by greedy short-term agents; even the shareholders have agency problems.
If financial institutions do not have enough capital, and shareholders don’t have enough of their own skin in the game, they will push CEOs and bankers to take on too much leverage and risks, because their own net worth is not at stake.
At the same time, there is a double agency problem, as the ultimate shareholders – individual shareholders – don’t directly control boards and CEOs.
These shareholders are represented by institutional investors (pension funds, etc.) whose interests, agendas, and cozy relationships often align them more closely with firms’ CEOs and managers.
Thus, repeated financial crises are also the result of a failed system of corporate governance.
Fourth, greed cannot be controlled by any appeal to morality and values.
Greed has to be controlled by fear of loss, which derives from knowledge that the reckless institutions and agents will not be bailed out.
The systematic bailouts of the latest crisis – however necessary to avoid a global meltdown – worsened this moral-hazard problem.
Not only were “too big to fail” financial institutions bailed out, but the distortion has become worse as these institutions have become – via financial-sector consolidation – even bigger.
If an institution is too big to fail, it is too big and should be broken up.
Unless we make these radical reforms, new Gordon Gekkos – and Charles Ponzis – will emerge.
For each chastised and born-again Gekko – as the Gekko in the new Wall Street is – hundreds of meaner and greedier ones will be born.
Partnership or Putsch?
EUGENE – In 2010, I sat across the table from Assistant US Trade Representative Barbara Weisel, who was responsible for negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the mega-regional free-trade treaty among Vietnam, Malaysia, and ten other Pacific Rim countries that President Barack Obama’s administration wants to conclude in the coming weeks.
At the time, I was Senior Policy Adviser for the US House of Representatives’ Committee on Education and Labor – a position that made me the top congressional staff member responsible for upholding labor standards in international trade treaties.
The purpose of the meeting was for Congress to understand what steps the Obama administration was taking to protect American workers from being forced into unfair competition with workers from low-wage trading partners.
I asked Weisel what I thought was a simple question: “What is the White House’s position on democracy?”
Weisel claimed not to understand, so I explained: A majority of congressional Democrats supported the principle that the United States should sign trade agreements only with countries that are democracies.
Other democracies feel the same way.
For example, trade agreements negotiated by members of the Commonwealth of Nations (formerly the British Commonwealth) contain just such a provision.
The logic is obvious: If we in developed democracies had lacked the right to protest, speak out, organize unions, and vote for representatives of our choosing, we would never have ended child labor or established the eight-hour workday.
Having used these rights to raise our own living standards, we should not now put developed countries’ workers in direct competition with workers who lack the basic freedoms needed to improve their own conditions.
But my explanation did not help.
Weisel stated simply that “we have no position” on democracy.
I pressed her on how the White House planned to deal with, for example, Vietnam – a country where children as young as 14 are forced to work 12-hour days, and where there is no right to free speech, no right to protest, no right to strike, and no freedom of association.
“Oh, you can have labor rights without democracy,” Weisel insisted.
She demurred when asked to name an example.
In reality, the one thing that non-democratic regimes can never tolerate is independent workers’ organizations.
That is why trade unionists were the first through the gates of Dachau, and why Poland’s Solidarity movement posed an existential threat to Communist power throughout the former Soviet bloc.
Indeed, part of international investors’ attraction to countries like Vietnam and China is not simply that wages are low, but that the absence of democratic rights promises to lock in cheap labor for years to come.
For example, when China revised its labor law in 2008, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and other members of the US-China Business Council lobbied successfully to limit the expansion of Chinese workers’ rights.
While China is not a party to the current negotiations, the TPP is designed to allow additional countries to sign on in the future – and the Chinese, we can assume, will be courted assiduously.
Former US Trade Representative Ron Kirk, for one, noted that he “would love nothing more” than to see China join the treaty.
But the TPP is not really a “trade” treaty at all.
Rather, it is a vehicle for corporate lobbyists to achieve what they have been unable to persuade legislators to support through normal means.
For example, pharmaceutical companies have insisted that the TPP force all countries to grant 12-year patents on prescription drugs – increasing their profits while delaying competition from cheaper generic versions.
Likewise, tobacco companies are seeking to use the TPP to prohibit developing countries – which represent the largest cigarette markets – from adopting new controls on their products.
The TPP’s most controversial provision, if adopted, would allow private corporations to sue foreign governments for adopting policies that adversely affect their expected profits.
For example, if Vietnam were to mandate six weeks of paid maternity leave for all employees, a foreign factory owner might sue the government, insisting that it either repeal the law or reimburse the company for the cost of providing this benefit.
A private tribunal would hear cases and issue binding rulings, with no possibility of appeal to any court or other democratically accountable authority.
This, then, is the future that the TPP holds out: a kind of Potemkin democracy, in which citizens are free to choose their flags and holidays but cannot afford to enact any laws that might reduce international investors’ profits.
Workers’ wages in the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and other developed countries would be inexorably competed down toward those of lower-wage trading partners, while developing-country workers would find it increasingly difficult – even in nominal democracies – to improve their standard of living.
The TPP is being crafted in utmost secrecy, with even legislators unable to see the full text that is being negotiated, though corporate lobbyists have been treated as partners in the drafting process.
This is not surprising: In the US, where almost five million manufacturing jobs have disappeared since the adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and where real wages have stagnated, a majority of voters across the political spectrum are opposed to more such treaties.
At least for the Obama administration, the rush to conclude the TPP negotiations is doubtless driven by the desire to close the deal well ahead of America’s midterm election in November.
And that, too, is bad for democracy.
Indeed, though the US Constitution stipulates that the power to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations” lies solely in the hands of Congress, the Obama administration is pressing legislators to approve so-called fast-track authority, under which they would have no say over either the TPP’s terms or the parties to it – or even the power to amend the treaty text in any way.
As a political scientist, I am sometimes asked how it is possible for democracies to enact laws that run counter to the interests of the vast majority of voters.
They do so, in part, by shunning any commitment to democracy itself.
There is no clearer example of this than the TPP, which almost certainly constitutes the single biggest threat to the preservation – or creation – of any signatory country’s middle class.
Restoring Yesterday's Hope for Tomorrow's World
WASHINGTON, DC – The year 2015 was difficult, punctuated by declining growth forecasts, horrific terror attacks, massive refugee flows, and serious political challenges, with populism on the rise in many countries.
In the Middle East, in particular, chaos and violence has continued to proliferate, with devastating consequences.
This represents a disappointing turn from the undoubtedly flawed, but far more hopeful world of just a few decades ago.
In his autobiography The World of Yesterday, Stefan Zweig described a similarly drastic change.
Born in 1881 in Vienna, Zweig spent his youth in an optimistic, civil, and tolerant environment.
Then, starting in 1914, he witnessed Europe’s collapse into World War I, followed by revolutionary convulsions, the Great Depression, the rise of Stalinism, and finally the barbarism of Nazism and the outbreak of World War II.
Devastated, Zweig committed suicide while in exile in 1942.
One imagines that Zweig would have been comforted by the post-WWII creation of the United Nations and the Bretton-Woods system, not to mention the subsequent decades of reconstruction and reconciliation.
He could have witnessed the cooperation and progress that marked the post-war era.
Perhaps, then, he would have looked at the period from 1914 to 1945 as a terrible but limited detour in the world’s march toward peace and prosperity.
Of course, the second half of the twentieth century was far from perfect.
Until 1990, peace was secured largely by the threat of mutual nuclear destruction.
Local conflicts, such as in Korea, Vietnam, parts of Africa, and the Middle East, took their toll.
And while about 100 developing countries gained independence, the process was not always peaceful.
At the same time, however, the world economy grew more rapidly than ever.
A strong middle class emerged in the advanced countries, and then began to appear elsewhere.
The Western democracies and Japan built economies in which productivity growth led to shared prosperity; governments engaged in regulation and redistribution, while private companies fueled growth by implementing technologically advanced production methods.
On both the regional and global levels, decisive progress was made in reaping the benefits from trade and economies of scale.
The European integration project seemed to herald a new kind of cooperation, which could extend to other regions and even influence global cooperation.
The generation that came of age in the 1960s felt much like Zweig had felt in his youth.
We believed that, though progress may not be linear, we could count on it.
We expected an increasingly peaceful and tolerant world, in which technological advances, together with well-governed markets, would generate ever-expanding prosperity.
In 1989, when the Soviet Union was poised to collapse and China was shifting to a market-based economy, Francis Fukuyama announced the “end of history.”
Over the last two decades, however, our hopes – political, social, and economic – have been repeatedly dashed.
There was a time when US policymakers were wondering whether Russia should join NATO.
That possibility is difficult even to consider today, after Russia’s intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea (apparently carried out in response to fears that Ukraine would deepen its ties with the European Union and NATO).
Many emerging economies achieved rapid growth for years – even decades – enabling billions of people to escape extreme poverty and reducing the wealth gap between developed and developing countries.
But that growth has lately slowed substantially, leading many to question whether economists spoke too soon when we labeled them the new engines of global economic growth.
Likewise, the Arab Spring in 2011 was supposed to herald a new, more democratic future for the Middle East and North Africa.
While Tunisia has averted disaster, most of the other affected countries have ended up mired in chaos, with Syria’s brutal civil war facilitating the rise of the Islamic State.
The euro, meanwhile, suffered its own crisis.
The common currency, once portrayed as the start of a quasi-federal Europe, instead created serious tension between “creditor” and “debtor” countries when many debtors faced a protracted economic downturn.
Just as Europe seemed finally to be escaping the euro crisis, refugees, especially from Syria, began flooding in.
That has jeopardized the Schengen Area of borderless travel, and some are asking whether the EU can withstand the pressure.
In the United States, the Syrian refugee crisis has led Congress to rush to restrict visa-free entrance for tourists from 38 countries.
This comes at a time when income and wealth inequality is skyrocketing in the US – the median wage for men has not increased in decades – leaving many to wonder whether their children will be able to maintain the living standard they enjoyed.
On top of all this, for the first time in decades, the growth of international trade no longer comfortably exceeds the growth of global output.
A fundamental driver of many of these problems may well be the unprecedented speed of change – driven by globalization and technological innovation – which has produced disruptions too quickly and on too large a scale for us to manage.
For example, while communication technology has done wonders, say, to expand access to finance in Africa, it has also enabled terrorist networks to encrypt their communications effectively.
And as the global financial crisis starkly demonstrated, regulators have struggled to keep pace with financial innovation.
The potential for human progress still seems immense, because the world wants for neither resources nor technological innovation.
Indeed, technology offers the hope of lifesaving medical treatments, higher economic productivity, and sustainable energy systems.
But people are fearful, as shown by the return of identity politics and a lack of economic and political inclusiveness.
As a result, productivity growth is slowing, and, though capital seems cheap and profits plentiful, investment remains sluggish.
The key to managing the disruptions and assuaging people’s fears is governance.
Zweig saw the world fall apart a century ago not because human knowledge stopped advancing, but because of widespread governance and policy failures.
As we enter 2016, we must focus on adapting governance, in all of its economic and political dimensions, to the twenty-first century, so that our resources and knowledge produce inclusive progress, not violent conflict.
The Good-Governance Trap
ROME – Development and improved governance have tended to go hand in hand.
But, contrary to popular belief, there is little evidence that success in implementing governance reforms leads to more rapid and inclusive economic and social development.
In fact, it may be the other way around.
The focus on good governance stems from the struggle to restore sustained growth during the developing-country debt crises of the 1980s.
Instead of reassessing the prevailing economic-policy approach, international development institutions took aim at the easy targets: developing-country governments.
Advising those governments on how to do their jobs became a new vocation for these institutions, which quickly developed new “technical” approaches to governance reform.
The World Bank, using well over 100 indicators, introduced a composite index of good governance, based on perceptions of voice and accountability, political stability and the absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, the rule of law, and levels of corruption.
By claiming that it had found a strong correlation between its governance indicators and economic performance, the Bank fueled hope that the key to economic progress had been found.
The case was flawed from the beginning.
The indicators used were ahistorical and failed to account for country-specific challenges and conditions, with cross-country statistical analyses suffering from selection bias and ignoring the interlinkages among a wide array of variables.
As a result, the World Bank badly overestimated the impact of governance reform on economic growth.
To be sure, governance that is effective, legitimate, and responsive provides untold benefits, especially when compared to the alternative: inefficient governance, cronyism, and corruption.
But the focus on governance reform has not proved nearly as effective as promised in fostering development.
In fact, this governance-focused approach may have actually undermined development efforts.
For starters, it has allowed international institutions to avoid acknowledging the shortcomings of the new development orthodoxy of the last two decades of the twentieth century, when Latin America lost over a decade, and Sub-Saharan Africa a quarter-century, of economic and social progress.
It has also complicated the work of governments unnecessarily.
With good-governance reforms now a condition for international aid, developing-country governments often end up mimicking donor expectations, instead of addressing the issues that are most pressing for their own citizens.
Indeed, such reforms can even undermine traditional rights and customary obligations worked out among communities over many generations.
Moreover, the required reforms are so wide-ranging that they are beyond the means of most developing countries to implement.
As a result, good-governance solutions tend to distract from more effective development efforts.
Another problem with governance reforms is that, although they are formally neutral, they often favor particular vested interests, with grossly unfair consequences.
Reforms aimed at decentralization and devolution have, in some cases, enabled the rise of powerful local political patrons.
The conclusion is clear: the development agenda should not be overloaded with governance reform.
As Harvard’s Merilee Grindle has put it, we should be aiming for “good enough” governance, selecting a few imperatives from a long list of possibilities.
But selecting the most important measures will not be easy.
Indeed, advocates of governance reform have rarely been right about the most effective approach.
Consider the unrelenting promotion of efforts to strengthen property rights.
Absent alienable individual ownership of productive resources, it is asserted, there will be insufficient means and incentives to pursue development initiatives, and shared resources (the “commons”) will be over-exploited and used inefficiently.
In reality, the so-called “tragedy of the commons” is neither ubiquitous nor inevitable, and individual property rights are not always the best – and never the only – institutional solution for dealing with social dilemmas.
The late Elinor Ostrom, a Nobel laureate in economics, showed that human societies have built myriad creative and lasting solutions to resolve a wide range of dilemmas involving the use of common resources.
The theme of good governance has special appeal to large bureaucratic organizations like multilateral development banks and UN agencies, which favor apolitical solutions to what are essentially political problems.
In other words, good governance is an ostensibly technocratic answer to what donors and other well-meaning international groups consider bad policies and, especially, bad politics.
Herein lies the real problem with the good-governance agenda: it supposes that the solution to most policy and political dilemmas lies in compliance with a set of formal process-oriented indicators.
But experience over two decades shows that such directives provide little practical guidance for solving the technically, socially, and politically complex real-world problems of economic development.
Recognizing that governance improves with development, the international community would be better served by pursuing reforms that directly advance development, instead of a broad agenda that may have, at best, a small indirect impact.
Such a pragmatic approach to improving governance would be neither dogmatic nor pretend to universality.
Instead, the major constraints would be identified, analyzed, and addressed, perhaps sequentially.
Many of the good-governance agenda’s key goals – empowerment, inclusion, participation, integrity, transparency, and accountability – can be built into workable solutions, not because outsiders demand them, but because effective solutions require them.
Such solutions should draw from relevant experiences, with the understanding that they do not amount to “best practices.”
The blind pursuit of good governance has guided development efforts for too long.
It is time to acknowledge what works – and disregard what does not.
Reengineering Government
PARIS – Since the financial crisis erupted in 2008, governments in advanced countries have been under significant pressure.
In many countries, tax receipts abruptly collapsed when the economy contracted, income dwindled, and real-estate transactions came to a halt.
The fall in tax revenues was in most cases sudden, deep, and lasting.
Governments had no choice but to raise taxes or to adjust to leaner times.
In some countries, the magnitude of the shock was such that a large tax increase could not fill the gap.
In Spain, despite tax hikes worth more than 4% of GDP since 2010, the tax-to-GDP ratio was only 38% in 2014, compared to 41% in 2007.
In Greece, tax increases amounted to 13% of GDP during the same period, but the tax ratio increased by only six percentage points.
Elsewhere, political limits to tax increases were reached before the gap could be filled.
Willingly or not, priority is being given to spending cuts.
Disillusion about future growth adds to the pressure.
The productivity record has generally been weak over the last few years, and this suggests that growth in the years ahead could be slower than previously expected.
Revenue growth thus looks insufficient to match the surge in age-related public spending on health and pensions.
This is a very different crisis from those experienced in the 1980s and the 1990s.
Back then, the main issue was political: the legitimacy and efficiency of public spending was under attack.
In the words of US President Ronald Reagan, government was the problem, not the solution.
The state, it was loudly proclaimed, had to be rolled back.
By contrast, today’s concerns are economic.
Partisan disagreement about the proper scope of government remains, but there is no overall rejection of state intervention.
Often, it is not interests or ideologies that make public spending cuts unavoidable – just facts.
How can governments rise to the challenge?
The risk they face is clear enough: absent a profound reengineering, inertial spending – owing to entitlements and civil-service wages – is bound to crowd out spending on new priorities and new policies.
Already, the countries that have been forced to cut the most have generally sacrificed public infrastructure investment.
Research is another area at risk.
Social investment in programs that pay off over the long term, such as pre-school child care, is suffering from financial constraints.
National security is not given the priority it deserves, despite growing threats.
Last but not least, makeshift solutions such as protracted wage freezes may eventually erode the quality of public services.
Fortunately, there are a few things governments can do to mitigate the effects of inertial spending.
For starters, they can simply systematize evaluations of the efficiency of public money.
In most countries, such assessments are still rare and haphazard: Parliaments often enact policies without knowing whether they are worth the money, and it may take a very long time before ineffective or inefficient policies are terminated.
That is why enabling legislation for spending programs should contain sunset clauses, with extensions subject to independent evaluation.
Second, spending reviews, too, should be systematized.
Setting priorities – whether to spend more on education and less on pensions, for example, or whether to invest in infrastructure or in research – entails hard choices that should be made explicit.
In an ideal world, these choices would be the focus of electoral debates and parliamentary work.
But behind every budget line is a constituency tempting policymakers to eschew hard decisions.
That is why structured spending reviews are useful: they force officials to bridge the gap between ends and means and encourage informed democratic decision-making.
Third, governments should equip themselves with a reengineering budget.
As private companies know, transformations – deep changes in the way things are done – often cost money before they bring savings.
This may be because the changes require investment in new technology, retraining of employees, or simply buying stakeholders’ consent.
Money earmarked in the budget for such reengineering of government programs would be a good investment.
Fourth, governments should promote public-sector innovation.
Contrary to popular prejudice, local governments and public agencies do innovate; what is missing is a mechanism to select and disseminate innovations in the same way the market selects new products or cost-saving processes.
A better way to deliver a public service may remain unknown for years.
That might well change if governments took simple steps like allocating more funding on a project basis and organizing contests.
For example, schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods should be allowed to tender for funds for educational innovation.
Last but not least, people should be empowered.
Citizens want a more nimble state that tailors its operations to local needs.
In the digital age, they want it to meet new standards of speed, reliability, and personalization.
They increasingly challenge the traditional view that efficiency and equality imply less individual choice.
And they want the government to be open, to guarantee access to data, and to make its efficiency and effectiveness directly observable.
These are powerful forces for change, and embattled governments should harness them to the goal of achieving the reengineering they so urgently need.
The alternative is to accept the deterioration of the quality of public services, which would lead only to a loss of government legitimacy and, with it, a diminishing willingness to pay taxes.
Beyond the Revolving Door
LONDON – “Honestly,” said Bill Gates during the COP21 meeting in Paris earlier this month, “I’ve been a bit surprised that the climate talks historically haven’t had R&D on the agenda in any way, shape, or form.”
So am I, and the question Gates raises goes to the heart of the relationship between business and government in solving our societies’ toughest problems, from ensuring the planet’s continued habitability to fostering stable and inclusive economic growth.
To be sure, in some areas, government authorities simply don’t consider making business a part of the solution early on.
The most striking recent example is the ongoing refugee crisis: Governments in Europe and around the world still don’t fully include business in early-stage thinking about how to manage the flow of asylum-seekers.
Granted, in many cases business leaders have chosen to remain on the sideline; but both they and governments need to adjust their thinking.
But in other areas, companies are more than eager to step up, be seen and heard, and exercise influence.
When it comes to technology, R&D, trade talks, and the like, the benefit for companies’ bottom line is direct and clear, and here Gates’ surprise is understandable, because corporate leaders typically lobby to participate and change the way governments think and act.
And yet dangers arise when business gets too close to government.
Sometimes the risk entails the proverbial “revolving door” between government and business, through which personnel glide from senior private-sector jobs to top official posts and back again.
It is a cycle that often resembles the fox guarding the henhouse, with those who regulate too close to those whom they regulate.
The most obvious example of this is finance and banking, where former employees of a single firm, Goldman Sachs, hold some of the most senior regulatory and monetary positions – and not just in the United States.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank was Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Goldman Sachs International, and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, worked for Goldman Sachs for 13 years.
But simply closing the revolving door in finance is not a solution.
Research by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has shown that regulation and legislation in this area must strike a balance, lest it undermine “the ability of regulatory agencies to seek and retain talent.”
In areas like defense, the revolving door moves swiftly.
According to the Boston Globe, from 2004 through 2008, some four-fifths of retiring three- and four-star US generals went to work as consultants or defense executives.
Likewise, the US-based group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics has shown the extent to which careers lead from the US Department of Defense to the defense industry.
Corporate scandals often reveal where business and government are too close for comfort, as when senior members of Toshiba’s executive team and board, for example, sit on Japanese government panels and commissions.
Likewise, Volkswagen’s close relationship with the German government has led to accusations that regulators went easy on the company, setting the stage for the emissions-testing scandal in which the carmaker is now embroiled.
But close ties between business and government are also necessary.
Strong economies need strong businesses and strong trade, and that requires good relationships with policymakers.
When government officials travel abroad to encourage economic cooperation, CEOs of some of the country’s biggest companies should go along.
The question is whether such companies are so important to the country’s economy and reputation that the government cannot regulate them properly.
They are given excessive leeway because they, like many financial firms, are too important to fail.
This complex dance between business and government is never-ending and always evolving.
It is the stuff of gatherings like the World Economic Forum, where business leaders and governments talk tough on panels and make nice in back rooms.
And the need to do both has become more obvious than ever in an era of slow economic growth and privatization of services once provided by the public sector.
The working relationship is important and should not be condemned, but it must be recognized openly.
This brings us back to Gates, who announced in Paris an initiative to spend a total of $20 billion on climate-related R&D over the next five years.
Gates’ plan highlights a frequently noted component of the relationship between government and business: governments’ vital role in funding early experimental research, which business then often turns into commercially viable solutions.
All of this is necessary to build stronger economies.
But, though Gates was right to ask why climate-change negotiations have not included R&D, let’s not pretend that any of this is simple.
The need for revolving doors, whether of personnel or ideas, between government and business cannot be a reason to allow companies to gain undue influence on public policy or for regulators to be kept weak.
Nor can it be a reason to give failing businesses a safety net for their own bad behavior or poor decisions.
This is especially true at a time when public trust is at a low ebb.
Rather than pretending that this symbiotic relationship doesn’t exist or, worse, that it isn’t necessary, both business and government must err on the side of transparency.
As Gates’ question made clear, in our fear of allowing the relationship to go too far, we risk not allowing it to go far enough.
Innovate or Stagnate
DUBAI – Companies, like people, grow old.
They start life small and eager to survive, fueled by youthful energy and fresh ideas.
They compete, expand, mature, and eventually, with few exceptions, fade into obscurity.
The same is true of governments: they, too, can lose the hunger and ambition of youth and allow themselves to become complacent.
Consider this: only 11% of the Fortune 500 companies from 1955 still exist today, while the average time that companies stay in the top 500 has fallen from 75 years to 15 years.
In this age of rapid change, those who lag behind become irrelevant– in a heartbeat.
Countries whose governments grow old face the same fate as outdated companies.
Their choice is simple: innovate or become irrelevant.
The race for national competitiveness is every bit as fierce as the competition among companies in the marketplace.
Countries compete for investment, talent, growth, and opportunity in a globalized world, and those that are pushed out of the running surrender the greatest prize of all: human development, prosperity, and happiness for their people.
To avoid this fate, governments must focus on what really matters: how to be like the 11% of companies that have remained, through the decades, in the top 500.
The lifecycle of companies should teach governments that the secret of eternal youth is constant innovation – seizing opportunities and behaving like the dynamic, entrepreneurial companies that are defining today’s world and shaping its future.
The key to corporations’ rejuvenation, civilizations’ evolution, and human development in general is simple: innovation.
I am always amazed when governments think they are an exception to this rule.
Innovation in government is not an intellectual luxury, a topic confined to seminars and panel discussions, or a matter only of administrative reforms.
It is the recipe for human survival and development, the fuel for constant progress, and the blueprint for a country’s rise.
The first key to business-like innovation in government is a focus on skills.
Top-tier companies continuously invest in their employees to provide them with the right skills for the marketplace.
Governments must do the same, by constantly upgrading skills and nurturing innovation – among their own employees, across key sectors of the economy, and at the foundations of the education system.
Governments that fail to equip new generations with the skills needed to become leaders for their time are condemning them to be led by other, more innovative societies.
A United States Department of Labor study found that 65% of children currently in primary school will grow up to work in jobs that do not exist today.
Another study at Oxford University found that 47% of job categories are at high risk of ceasing to exist because they can be automated through technology.
So, how do we prepare our children and future generations for such times?
How do we equip our countries to compete, not only today, but in the coming decades as well?
The answer lies in honing our children’s creativity, and providing them with the analytical and communication skills needed to channel it toward productive ends.
The second key to transforming governments into engines of innovation is to shift the balance of investment toward intangibles, as in the private sector.
Whereas more than 80% of the value of the Standard & Poor’s 500 consisted of tangible assets 40 years ago, today that ratio is reversed: more than 80% of the largest companies’ value is intangible – the knowledge and skills of their employees and the intellectual property embedded in their products.
Governments, too, should think strategically about shifting their spending away from tangible infrastructure like roads and buildings, and toward intangibles like education and research and development.
It is no secret that the US and Europe, combined, spend more than $250 billion of public funds annually on R&D to maintain their leading positions.
Likewise, a key driver of rapid development in countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and South Korea has been their strategic decision to shift public expenditure away from hard infrastructure and toward the “soft” infrastructure needed to build and sustain a knowledge economy.
Likewise, the British government spends markedly more of its budget on such intangibles than on tangible assets.
Most of today’s transformative companies are well known for having an innovative corporate culture and working environment that inspires and empowers employees.
Governments that set an example for innovation have the power to implant a nationwide culture of creativity.
When such a culture takes root, people feel inspired to run further with their ideas, to aim higher with their ambitions, and to pursue bigger dreams.
That is how countries that encourage innovation take the lead – and stay there.
To sustain innovation, businesses must attract and retain the most creative and productive minds.
In this age of global mobility, countries, too, go head to head in the battle for talent.
Global cities compete to provide an ideal life and work environment for innovators, and to harness their creativity to become stronger and more competitive still.
Innovative governments do the same thing on a national scale.
They attract talent, perform efficiently, and continually upgrade their systems and services.
They empower citizens to cultivate their collective energy and develop their potential, and thus become drivers of their countries’ growth and advancement in the world arena.
Above all, they value human minds and help people become better guardians and builders of our planet.
For governments, innovation is an existential question.
Only those that sustain innovation can drive change in the world, because they are the governments that never grow old.
The Scarecrow of National Debt
CAMBRIDGE – Most people are more worried by government debt than about taxation.
“But it’s trillions” a friend of mine recently expostulated about the United Kingdom’s national debt.
He exaggerated a bit: it is £1.7 trillion ($2.2 trillion).
But one website features a clock showing the debt growing at a rate of £5,170 per second.
Although the tax take is far less, the UK government still collected a hefty £750 billion in taxes in the last fiscal year.
The tax base grows by the second, too, but no clock shows that.
Many people think that, however depressing heavy taxes are, it is more honest for governments to raise them to pay for their spending than it is to incur debt.
Borrowing strikes them as a way of taxing by stealth.
“How are they going to pay it back?” my friend asked.
“Think of the burden on our children and grandchildren.”
I should say that my friend is extremely old.
Horror of debt is particularly marked in the elderly, perhaps out of an ancient feeling that one should not meet one’s maker with a negative balance sheet.
I should also add that my friend is extremely well educated, and had, in fact, played a prominent role in public life.
But public finance is a mystery to him: he just had the gut feeling that a national debt in the trillions and growing by £5,170 a second was a very bad thing.
One should not attribute this gut feeling to financial illiteracy. It has been receiving strong support from those supposedly well-versed in public finance, particularly since the economic collapse of 2008.
Britain’s national debt currently stands at 84% of GDP.
This is dangerously near the threshold of 90% identified by Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff (together with Carmen Reinhart and Vincent Reinhart), beyond which economic growth stalls.
In the face of criticism of the data underlying this threshold Rogoff has held firm, and he now gives a reason for his alarm.
With US government debt running at 82% of GDP, the danger is of a “fast upward shift in interest rates.” The “potentially massive” fiscal costs of this could well require “significant tax and spending adjustments” (economist’s code for increasing taxes and reducing public spending), which would increase unemployment.
This is the financial leg of the familiar “crowding out” argument.
The higher the national debt, according to this view, the greater the risk of government default – and therefore the higher the cost of fresh government borrowing.
This in turn will raise the cost of new private-sector borrowing.
(That is why Rogoff wants the US government to “lock in” currently low rates by issuing much longer-term debt to fund public infrastructure).
Maintaining low interest rates for private bank loans has been one of the main arguments for reducing budget deficits.
But this argument – or set of arguments (there are different strands) – for fiscal austerity is invalid.
A government that can issue debt in its own currency can easily keep interest rates low.
The rates are bounded by concerns about inflation, over-expansion of the state sector, and the central bank’s independence; but, with our relatively low levels of debt (Japan’s debt amounts to over 230% of its GDP) and depressed output and inflation, these limits are quite distant in the UK and the US.
And as the record bears out, continuous increases in both countries’ national debt since the crash have been accompanied by a fall in the cost of government borrowing to near zero.
The other leg of the argument for reducing the national debt has to do with the “burden on future generations.”
US President Dwight Eisenhower expressed this thought succinctly in his State of the Union message in 1960: generating a surplus to pay back debt was a necessary “reduction on our children’s inherited mortgage.”
The idea is that future generations would need to reduce their consumption in order to pay the taxes required to retire the outstanding debt: government deficits today “crowd out” the next generation’s consumption.
Although governments have endlessly repeated this argument since the 2008 crash as a justification for fiscal tightening, the economist A. P. Lerner pointed out its fallacy years ago.
The burden of reduced consumption to pay for government spending is actually borne by the generation which lends the government the money in the first place.
This is crystal clear if the government simply raises the money it needs for its spending through taxes rather than borrowing it.
Furthermore, the idea that additional government spending, whether financed by taxation or borrowing, is bound to reduce private consumption by the same amount assumes that no flow of additional income results from the extra government spending – in other words, that the economy is already at full capacity.
This has not been true of most countries since 2008.
But in the face of such weighty, if fallacious, testimony to the contrary, who am I to persuade my elderly friend to ignore his gut when it comes to thinking about the national debt?
Fraud, Fools, and Financial Markets
NEW HAVEN – Adam Smith famously wrote of the “invisible hand,” by which individuals’ pursuit of self-interest in free, competitive markets advances the interest of society as a whole.
And Smith was right: Free markets have generated unprecedented prosperity for individuals and societies alike. But, because we can be manipulated or deceived or even just passively tempted, free markets also persuade us to buy things that are good neither for us nor for society.
This observation represents an important codicil to Smith’s vision. And it is one that George Akerlof and I explore in our new book, Phishing for Phools: The Economics of Manipulation and Deception.
Most of us have suffered “phishing”: unwanted emails and phone calls designed to defraud us.
A “phool” is anyone who does not fully comprehend the ubiquity of phishing.
A phool sees isolated examples of phishing, but does not appreciate the extent of professionalism devoted to it, nor how deeply this professionalism affects lives.
Sadly, a lot of us have been phools – including Akerlof and me, which is why we wrote this book.
Routine phishing can affect any market, but our most important observations concern financial markets – timely enough, given the massive boom in the equity and real-estate markets since 2009, and the turmoil in global asset markets since last month.
As too many optimists have learned to their detriment, asset prices are highly volatile, and a whole ocean of phishes is involved.
Borrowers are lured into unsuitable mortgages; firms are stripped of their assets; accountants mislead investors; financial advisers spin narratives of riches from nowhere; and the media promote extravagant claims.
But the losers in the downturns are not just those who have been duped.
A chain of additional losses occurs when the inflated assets have been purchased with borrowed money.
In that case, bankruptcies and fear of bankruptcy spawn an epidemic of further bankruptcies, reinforcing fear.
Then credit dries up and the economy collapses. This vicious downward spiral for business confidence typically features phishes – for example, the victims of Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme – discovered only after the period of irrational exuberance has ended.
Epidemics, in economics as much as in medicine, call for an immediate and drastic response.
The response by the authorities to the Great Crash of 1929 was small and slow, and the world economy entered a “Dark Age” that lasted through the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Second World War.
The 2007-2009 financial crisis portended a similar outcome, but this time the world’s governments and central banks intervened promptly, in a coordinated fashion, and with an appropriately high volume of stimulus.
The recovery has been weak; but we are nowhere near a new Dark Age.
For that we should be grateful.
Yet some now argue that the fiscal and monetary authorities should not have responded so quickly or strongly when the 2007-2009 crisis erupted.
They believe that the primary cause of the crisis was what economists call moral hazard: because risk-takers expected that the authorities would intervene to protect them when their bets went awry, they took even greater risks.
By contrast, our view (supported by plenty of data) is that rapidly rising prices usually reflect irrational exuberance, aided and abetted by phishes.
The irrationally exuberant were not thinking of the returns they would garner if the authorities intervened to maintain the economy and the flow of credit (or, in extreme cases, moved to bail out their bank or enterprise).
Such possibilities were a marginal consideration in the euphoria preceding the 2007-2009 crisis: those selling at inflated prices were making profits; and buyers “knew” they were doing the right thing – even when they weren’t.
The reluctance to acknowledge the need for immediate intervention in a financial crisis is based on a school of economics that fails to account for the irrational exuberance that I have explored elsewhere, and that ignores the aggressive marketing and other realities of digital-age markets examined in Phishing for Phools.
But adhering to an approach that overlooks these factors is akin to doing away with fire departments, on the grounds that without them people would be more careful – and so there would then be no fires.
We found out many years ago, to the world’s great regret, what happens when a financial epidemic is allowed to run its course.
Our analysis indicates that not only are there endemic and natural forces that make the financial system highly volatile; but also that swift, effective intervention is needed in the face of financial collapse.
We need to give free rein to fiscal and monetary authorities to take aggressive steps when financial turmoil turns into financial crisis.
One Dark Age is one too many.
The Wages of Wage Fear
LONDON – If all else fails, try the previously unthinkable.
It is not a bad principle for economic policy in the best of times.
Today, it may be just what is needed: many Western countries – certainly the United States, Japan, and Germany, probably the United Kingdom, and soon much of the rest of the eurozone – should pursue direct government intervention in wage bargaining, especially for the lowest earners.
Japan has spent the last 15 years struggling with slow growth, anemic household demand (especially among poorer families), and rising inequality and poverty.
Similar conditions now prevail in the US as well; indeed, they helped Donald Trump to be elected president, by creating a sufficiently large group of what he quite reasonably called “forgotten Americans.”
And before Trump’s victory, such conditions spurred the UK’s so-called “left behind” to vote for Brexit.
Without a sharp increase in wages – mainly statutory minimum wages – populism will continue to thrive, and most Western economies will remain saddled with slow growth.
Inequality not just of income and wealth, but also of perceived political voice and influence, will continue to grow.
And the temptation to pursue shortsighted solutions – such as closing borders and implementing protectionism – will become irresistible.
Yet the suggestion that governments should act directly to raise the price of lower-skilled labor is likely to be met with sharp intakes of breath and sotto voce comments that I must be mad.
Don’t I know that higher minimum wages risk causing unemployment?
Haven’t I heard of the “rise of the robots” and the growing power of automation, more generally, to destroy jobs?
Don’t I believe in market solutions?
The answer to all three questions is “yes.”
But policies need to be tailored to conditions, and they need to reflect choices between the competing interests of different groups.
(Indeed, that is the whole point of politics.)
And current conditions, together with the interests of the “left behind,” indicate that the once-unthinkable has become essential, if not inevitable.
The main reason why governments are leery of intervening in wage setting is the memory of the failed wage and price controls during the period of high inflation in the 1970s – controls that gave rise to large and troublesome distortions.
But a second, more current reason relates to lobbying from businesses, which argue that corporate competitiveness depends on cheap labor.
Governments also have their own self-interest to consider: the public sector often employs a lot of minimum-wage earners.
But it is time to take courage.
Fiscal policy – cutting taxes or raising public spending – is too constrained by high government debt to be much use in stimulating demand, and attempts to use it to redistribute resources from rich to poor have created their own problems.
Monetary policy – in particular, the vast money-printing “quantitative easing” programs pursued by central banks in recent years – has run out of space, too, with price inflation ticking up and central-bank balance sheets a record size.
Wage intervention is virtually the only option left.
Moreover, the risks of raising the minimum wage are probably not as great as they have been made out to be – at least not now.
To be sure, there are times when such wage increases can risk killing employment.
But today is not one of those times: countries like the US, Japan, Germany, and the UK are at virtually full employment.
The risk in these countries is not the risk of rising unemployment, but stagnating wages, which has caused household demand to remain depressed or grow only sluggishly, thereby deterring businesses from investing.
In the US, low wages at the bottom end of the labor market have discouraged millions of working-age individuals from even seeking employment.
That certainly can help to reduce the official unemployment rate, but it does little for the economy.
The US federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is one-third lower in real (inflation-adjusted) terms than it was at its peak in 1968.
Japan’s average statutory minimum wage of ¥823 ($7.40) per hour is barely higher.
Even where the authorities have taken steps to raise minimum wages – the UK since last year, as well as US states like California and New York, which are targeting a $15 hourly minimum wage by 2020 – they are not moving fast or far enough.
Japan is raising its minimum wage only slightly faster than inflation.
Inequality remains the scourge of our era, with the bargaining power of the lowest-skilled workers severely undermined by automation and developing-country competition.
If “forgotten” groups are not to be permanently left behind and alienated, governments must take bolder action.
In the 1960s, Japan’s “income doubling” plan helped it to develop a consumer economy.
Perhaps the time has come to introduce a “minimum-wage doubling” plan, implemented over a few years, thus giving business the chance to adjust.
For leaders who have received the financial support of the very rich and the electoral support of those left behind, such a plan would seem to be a political winner.
Any interest, President Trump?
The Creative State
LONDON – The conventional view in mainstream economics today is that governments have little capacity to spark innovation.
The state should play as limited a role in the economy as possible, the thinking goes, intervening only in cases of “market failure.”
This is far from the truth.
In fact, governments can and do play a critical role in spurring innovation – actively creating new markets, instead of just fixing them.
To be sure, advocates of a limited economic role for government believe that market failure justifies some funding of infrastructure and basic science.
But such limited intervention can hardly explain the billions of public-sector dollars that have flowed toward downstream applied research, even providing early-stage financing for companies.
Indeed, in some of the world’s most famous innovation hubs, the state has played a key “entrepreneurial” role, envisioning and financing the creation of entire new fields, from information technology to biotech, nanotech, and green tech.
In Silicon Valley, for example, the government has acted as a strategic investor through a decentralized network of public institutions: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, NASA, the Small Business Innovation Research program (SBIR), and the National Science Foundation.
The sums involved can be staggering, and not just in IT; large amounts of funding have also been channeled to energy and life sciences.
In 2011, for instance, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) invested $31 billion in biomedical research.
Marcia Angell, a professor at Harvard Medical School, has shown that this financing played a crucial role in the development of some of the most revolutionary new drugs in recent decades.
Similarly, for some of the most innovative American companies, financing from the SBIR has proved to be more important than private venture capital.
Examples outside the US include Israel, where the public venture-capital fund Yozma has provided early-stage funding to some of the country’s most dynamic companies, and Finland, where Sitra, the public innovation fund, supplied early financing for Nokia.
In China, the state-owned development bank is offering billions of dollars in loans to some of the country’s most innovative companies, including Huawei and Yingli Solar.
These types of public investments are critical in creating and shaping new markets.
Indeed, government investment played a central role in developing nearly all of the technologies that make the iPhone a smart phone: the Internet, GPS, touchscreens, and the advances in voice recognition underlying Siri.
Similarly, in many countries, it is the public sector that is leading the way in making green technology possible.
Recognizing the importance of government investment in promoting innovation and growth implies the need to rethink the conventional wisdom about state intervention.
Instead of focusing on picking individual technologies or firms, public organizations should act like investors, betting on a diversified “portfolio” of choices.
Like any other investor, the state will not always succeed.
In fact, failure is more likely, because government agencies often invest in the areas of highest uncertainty, where private capital is reluctant to enter.
This means that public organizations must be capable of taking chances and learning from trial and error.
If failure is an unavoidable part of the innovation game, and if government is crucial for innovation, society must be more tolerant of “government failure.”
But the reality is that when government fails, there is public outcry – and silence when it succeeds.
For example, the bankruptcy of the US solar energy firm Solyndra, which received a $500 million government-guaranteed loan, triggered partisan protests.
Yet few have paused to consider that the government provided nearly the same amount to Tesla to help it develop the Tesla S car, a product that is considered an archetype of Silicon Valley innovation.
What, then, might make the public more accepting of government failure?
Private venture capitalists cover their losses from failed investments with their profits from those that succeed; but government programs are rarely set up to generate significant returns.
While some argue that the government’s return comes through taxes, the current tax system is not working, owing not only to loopholes, but also to rate reductions.
When NASA was founded, the top marginal tax rate was over 90%.
And capital gains tax has fallen by more than 50% since the 1980s.
In order to build support for public investment in higher-risk innovation, perhaps taxpayers should receive a more direct return, by channeling profits into a public innovation fund to finance the next wave of technologies.
When investments are in upstream basic research, the spillover effect across industries and sectors is sometimes enough of a social reward.
But other cases might require creating alternative incentives.
For example, some of the profits from the government’s investment in Tesla could have been recovered through shares (or royalties), and used to cover the losses from its investment in Solyndra.
Repayment of public loans to business could be made contingent on income, as student loans often are.
And the prices of drugs that are developed largely with NIH funding could be capped, so that the taxpayer does not pay twice.
One thing is clear: the current approach suffers from serious shortcomings, largely because it socializes the risks and privatizes the rewards.
This is hurting not only future innovation opportunities, but also the government’s ability to communicate its role to the public.
Acknowledging the role that the state has played – and should continue to play – in shaping innovation enables us to begin debating the most important question: What are the new visionary public investments needed to drive future economic growth?
The Productivity of Trust
CAMBRIDGE – The Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman once quipped that “Canada is essentially closer to the United States than it is to itself.”
After all, most of its citizens live in a narrow band along the more than 3,000-mile-long border.
Most Canadians live closer to more Americans than they do to other Canadians.
The same can be said of corporations and governments.
Most firms are closer to the government than they are to other firms: they interact with government rules and agencies more than they do with the rest of the business community.
The quality of that interaction and its evolution over time is probably the most fundamental determinant of a country’s potential for growth and prosperity.
But this is not the Weltanschauung – the worldview – that permeates private-sector discourse, especially the views expressed by most chambers of trade and industry and business associations around the world.
Business organizations often hew to Ronald Reagan’s dictum: “Government is not the solution to our problems; government is the problem.”
It is a great sound bite: short, recursive, and somewhat poetic.
Unfortunately, it is also dangerously misleading.
After all, even if government were the problem, then changing what it does must be part of the solution.
The truth is that markets cannot exist without governments, and vice versa.
Governments are essential to the establishment of security, justice, property rights, and contract enforcement, all of which are essential to a market economy.
Governments must also organize the provision of infrastructure for transportation, communication, energy, water, and waste disposal.
They run and regulate health-care systems and primary, secondary, tertiary, and vocational education.
They create the rules and provide the certifications that allow firms to assure their customers, workers, and neighbors that what they do is safe.
They protect creditors and minority shareholders from miscreant managers (and managers from impulsive creditors).
Saying that governments should get out of the way and let the private sector do its thing is like saying that air traffic controllers should get out of the way and let pilots do their thing.
In fact, governments and the private sector need each other, and they need to find better ways to collaborate.
The problem is that in many countries, both developed and developing, the current relationship between the private sector and the government is often dysfunctional.
Not only is it characterized by deep distrust, but the broader society does not find a closer relationship to be either legitimate or in the public interest, and for good reason.
The private sector often engages with the government in order to make itself more profitable.
After all, maximizing profits is what CEOs are supposed to do.
And the government has ways to help: It can force suppliers to sell their inputs more cheaply, repress workers’ wage demands, protect the final market from competition by imports or new entrants, or lower their taxes.
But these schemes make firms more profitable by making their suppliers, workers, and customers poorer.
Accepting such demands makes the government rightly illegitimate in the eyes of the rest of society, which cherishes higher priorities than redistribution in favor of the already rich.
Outcomes would be very different if the focus of the relationship were productivity rather than profitability.
Productivity improvements, by lowering costs, allow firms to pay their workers and suppliers better, reduce prices for consumers, pay more in taxes, and still make more money for their shareholders.
A focus on productivity is win-win-win.
Governments can do many things, in a variety of areas, to raise productivity.
Fresh produce requires a cold-storage logistic system, a green lane at customs, certification of good agricultural practices, and sanitary permits.
Tourism depends on sensible visa requirements, convenient airports, road signs, hotel construction permits, and the preservation of cultural sites and coastlines.
Manufacturing requires dedicated urban space that is adequately connected to power, water, transport, logistics, security, and a diverse labor force.
All of these productivity-boosting inputs require institutions that teach and extend industry-relevant knowledge and skills.
None of them appears in the World Bank’s Doing Business indicators or the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index.
And yet, without these public inputs, the industries that depend on them cannot succeed.
That is precisely what happens in the absence of a sound and legitimate basis for cooperation between the government and the private sector.
The result is inadequate provision of public goods that raise productivity and make everyone better off.
To create such a basis for cooperation, many countries need a new compact between the government and the private sector.
This will not be possible if business groups insist on putting taxes at the center of the discussion.
Instead, they should focus on measures that raise productivity.
More broadly, business groups should seek only those government policies that are unambiguously in the public interest.
Demands that are perceived as greedy erode legitimacy and, ultimately, effectiveness.
In this context, watchdog NGOs dedicated to scoring the public-interest value of what business groups ask for from the government could facilitate trust.
Perhaps most important, business associations do their members a disservice by seeking to impose on them a single voice.
Doing so usually leads to a focus on policies that are preferred by all members – such as lower taxes – instead of measures that are important to the productivity of each member.
Just as monopolies are bad for markets and politics, business representation in the private sector would benefit from more competition.
The Procurement Goldmine
WASHINGTON, DC – Gold is rare.
More than 99.9% of the Earth’s crust is composed of oxides of silicon, aluminum, calcium, magnesium, sodium, iron, potassium, titanium, and phosphorus.
So, for most of human history, people have become quite excited when they have discovered gold.
Despite the serious environmental consequences of gold mining, including mercury and cyanide pollution and the devastation of landscapes, humanity has not given up the search – and seems unlikely to do so any time soon.
But there is a figurative goldmine – safer and potentially at least as lucrative as the real thing – that most countries possess, but few choose to exploit fully: government procurement.
The potential adverse consequences of government procurement are well known.
It can enable companies to charge excessive prices for low-quality goods and unreliable services, while facilitating corruption, abuses of power, and waste.
To mitigate these risks, most countries have implemented requirements for open bidding processes and strict transparency rules for government purchases.
Indeed, most recent free-trade agreements require signatories to open up government procurement to one another’s firms, and the World Bank publishes the names of firms barred for fraud or corruption from bidding on Bank-financed projects.
Countries that forego open bidding processes end up with the kind of large-scale theft that has been documented in Venezuela and almost certainly occurred in Ukraine under deposed President Viktor Yanukovych.
But beneath all of this arsenic is gold.
Most modern production involves not just the cost of doing things, but also the cost of figuring out how to do them.
Before aircraft manufacturers can produce and sell a new airplane model, they must spend billions of dollars over a decade or more of development – costs that must later be recouped.
If they were not sure whether there would be a market for the new model, few would assume these costs.
That is where government procurement comes in.
For example, in 1946, the United States government issued a contract for Boeing to develop the B-52.
The government obviously did not want the company to deliver more of the same; it wanted the first fast jet-powered strategic bomber.
After all, the second-best army in a war is the loser.
The contract thus had to reflect the risks inherent in finding out how to design and produce the most advanced aircraft of its time.
But the benefits of the government purchase extended beyond its specific goal, when Boeing used the knowhow it acquired developing the B-52 to create its commercial B-707 aircraft.
Though the government never purposely promoted the development of commercial airplanes, its procurement of high-quality, technologically advanced military aircraft was essential to the emergence of America’s globally dominant commercial aircraft industry.
Simply put, figuring out how to do one thing often makes it easier to do other things.
In this way, a government that is exacting about the quality of its purchases can have a powerful impact on the evolution of its country’s comparative advantage.
Israel’s government has had a similar impact through its effort to manage its limited water resources.
Let’s say that the country incurs a cost of 100 of some unit because of its water shortages.
The innovations that the government encourages, such as drip irrigation or desalination, not only reduce the domestic cost of such shortages to, say, 70, but also underpin an industry that, by selling its wares in the most demanding markets, accrues a global value of more than 1,000.
In this sense, Israel’s water scarcity has made the country wealthier than it otherwise would have been.
Likewise, Israel’s military investments have generated a set of solutions that, with some extra effort, have had useful – and lucrative – civilian applications.
This helps to explain why private investment in research and development constitutes a larger share of GDP in Israel than anywhere else in the world.
The lessons from army purchases can be applied elsewhere.
Governments are in the business of procuring solutions to their particular society’s most pressing challenges.
Given that a country’s problems are rarely unique, innovative solutions can spawn globally competitive – even dominant – industries.
And solutions for one problem may have applications in other areas.
This should serve as a model for Latin America as it works to improve the quality of its educational systems.
As it stands, the eight Latin American countries that take the OECD’s standardized PISA exam are among the 15 worst-performing countries of the 65 that participate in the program.
Instead of sinking massive amounts of money into poorly performing school systems, Latin American governments would undoubtedly be interested in innovative solutions, such as tablet-based textbooks, that can help teachers provide effective lessons, monitor their students’ progress, and identify remediation strategies.
Beyond improving their own children’s performance, such efforts could spawn a globally competitive industry in state-of-the-art teaching tools.
These are just a few examples of the value that can be extracted from the government-procurement goldmine.
By committing to purchase large amounts of high-quality products that address major national challenges, governments can encourage private, public, or mixed organizations to incur the fixed costs of finding solutions.
In many cases, the benefits of those solutions will extend far beyond their original purpose.
But, in pursuing such a path, governments must remember that mining is a potentially dangerous industry that must be approached with care.
To this end, they could begin by applying, say, 5% of their procurement budgets to nurture urgently needed solutions in areas with potentially large global markets.
After all, anything that is worth doing is worth doing better.
Let’s Get Fiscal
LONDON – Everyone knows there is no gain without pain.
But there can be pain without gain – a lesson that Western populations have been learning the hard way since at least 2012.
With years of fiscal austerity in the United States, Europe, and Japan having achieved nothing, it is time for governments to start spending again.
The proposal will be met with outrage from many governments, especially, but not exclusively, Germany’s, and will be dismissed by the many political candidates who treat sovereign debt, built up by the incumbents they are seeking to depose, as the devil’s work.
But beyond ideology and self-interest lies a simple and unavoidable truth: austerity is not working.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reluctantly acknowledged austerity’s failure when he announced on June 1 that his government would postpone a planned increase in the country’s consumption tax.
Far from helping to control Japan’s budget deficit and huge public debt, the tax hike probably would have reduced revenues.
After all, the previous hike, implemented in April 2014, quickly drove the economy back into recession.
The eurozone – the developed world’s leading champion of austerity – has yet to come to the same realization, despite glaring evidence.
In 2012, eurozone leaders signed a fiscal compact aimed at controlling public debt – which, in total, amounted to 91.3% of GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund – by forcing countries to cut spending and raise taxes.
By 2015, the eurozone’s budget deficit, as a share of GDP, had fallen by two-thirds from its peak in 2010.
Yet gross public debt had actually increased, to 93.2% of GDP.
Indeed, while Germany has managed to reduce its gross public debt, from 79.7% of GDP in 2012 to 71% last year, debt ratios in France and Italy have continued to rise, despite tight fiscal controls (especially in Italy).
Elsewhere in Europe, the United Kingdom has followed a similar trajectory, with gross public debt increasing from 85.3% of GDP in 2012 to 89.3% of GDP in 2015.
And in the US, the debt ratio rose from 102.5% to 105.8% over the same period.
The problem, of course, lies in sluggish economic growth, which undermines wage growth, weakens tax revenues, and makes it impossible for governments to pay down their debts.
Among the biggest drags on growth today is fiscal austerity.
The more governments cut their deficits, the faster growth slows – and the further out of reach debt-reduction targets become.
Thus runs the self-defeating cycle of fiscal austerity.
To be sure, this is not always how austerity works.
In the inflation-plagued 1970s and 1980s, when investors’ demand for inflation-risk premia pushed up long-term borrowing costs, larger deficits tended to boost long-term interest rates further, while smaller deficits reduced them.
It was this experience that caused policymakers after 2010 to assume that reducing government demand would help to boost private investment.
(In the eurozone, it should be noted, arguments for fiscal austerity were also fueled by mistrust among governments, with creditor countries demanding that debtors endure some pain in exchange for “gains” like bailouts.)
But times have changed.
For starters, we are no longer living in an inflationary era.
On the contrary, Japan and some eurozone countries face deflation, while inflation in the UK is essentially zero.
Only in America is inflation picking up – and only gently.
Moreover, long-term borrowing costs are at historic lows, just as they have been throughout the last five years.
Pursuing austerity in this context has resulted in a drag on growth so severe that not even the halving of energy prices over the last 18 months has overcome it.
Expansionary monetary policy – that is, massive injections of liquidity through so-called quantitative easing – is clearly not enough, either.
While QE does serve a purpose – and remains necessary in Europe and Japan – it has failed to stimulate private investment and accelerate job creation and wage growth.
Some direct intervention in wages may help.
The UK has implemented an increase in the mandatory minimum wage, and some US states, led by California, will soon follow.
Japan, which faces stagnant wages, despite apparent labor shortages, may stand to benefit the most from this approach.
But, in today’s world, nothing can substitute for fiscal expansion.
Many countries, particularly in Europe, need to boost public investment in infrastructure.
More broadly, Europe needs a new Marshall Plan, this time self-financed, rather than funded by the Americans, to kick-start economic growth and boost productivity.
There is plenty of scope for a similar program in the US, too.
Such spending could even help get tax revenues growing, by pushing employment and wages higher.
At a time of low borrowing costs and little to no inflation (or even deflation), austerity is not the answer.
It is time for policymakers to recognize that there is no need for pain that is not bringing any gain.
It is time to get fiscal.
Grading Obamanomics
PALO ALTO – It is still too soon to gauge the full economic impact of President Barack Obama’s implemented and proposed policies, but a preliminary read indicates limited short-term benefit at large long-term cost.
The administration is exploiting a crisis atmosphere to enact a vast agenda that would reengineer the American economy, from autos and financial services to health care, energy, and the distribution of income.
Obama outsourced the details of the $787 billion fiscal stimulus to Congress and, no surprise, the old barons of the House stuffed it with pork and social engineering.
Several months later, only 4%-6% of the funds have been spent, and the federal government is brow-beating state governments – for example, demanding that California rescind a small pay cut for some unionized workers or lose $7 billion in stimulus funds.
(Intervening in contractual relations ex post to enforce union demands is an emerging characteristic of the administration).
The foreclosure relief plan is off to an even slower start, and is likely to run into numerous problems concerning how to rework delinquent mortgages without inducing a lot more delinquencies.
So score the stimulus a very expensive, largely wasted opportunity.
Instead, Obama could, for example, have suspended the payroll tax for a year, getting money directly into people’s pockets quickly and decreasing the need for firms to lay off workers.
Obama’s long-run budget calls for much higher spending, higher taxes, and an explosion of debt that will crowd out borrowing in capital markets by private companies, state and local governments, and developing countries.
Obama would add $6.5 trillion to the United States’ national debt, more than all previous presidents, from George Washington to George W. Bush, combined.
That is in addition to explicit tax hikes on income, capital gains, and dividends, the implicit ones on energy via cap-and-trade, etc.
It appears that the Obama strategy is to “stuff the beast” (the mirror image of the tax-cutting “starve the beast” philosophy attributed to some of President Ronald Reagan’s advisers), i.e., to initiate massive spending and hide the true cost from citizens.
The large deficits will eventually force much higher taxes, such as a national value-added tax similar to those in Europe, or gigantic increases in everyone’s income taxes.
The Federal Reserve lowered its target federal funds rate to zero before Obama was inaugurated, and initiated many programs to try to revive credit markets, with mixed results (the commercial paper facility has helped, whereas others seem to have gotten off to less sanguine starts).
The Fed’s independence is a key component of its anti-inflation credibility, and a key test for Obama will be to support the Fed’s efforts to withdraw the liquidity before substantial inflation pressures assert themselves several years from now.
The Obama administration also seems to be heading toward regulating derivatives and financial institutions deemed too big to fail.
America does need a clearinghouse for derivatives, and a much higher percentage of derivative trading should take place on exchanges, rather than bilaterally over the counter.
Any institution that is or could quickly become too big to fail needs to have adequate capital (rising with size), and real-time continuous monitoring of risk, but these measures should be implemented without overbearing micromanagement.
Unfortunately, the Obama administration’s decision to put the unions ahead of secured debt-holders in the orchestrated Chrysler bankruptcy risks rupturing the basic fabric of credit markets.
But Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner’s much-ridiculed bank “stress tests” made sense (although one can argue that sufficiently dire scenarios were not included or that too much was negotiated with the banks, etc.).
Determining the size of likely losses is necessary to decide whether banks’ retained earnings from profitable ongoing operations and their ability to raise private capital will allow them to work down their toxic assets over time.
If not, more draconian solutions will be necessary.
I support Geithner’s plan to cooperate with private investors in dealing with the banks’ toxic assets, because they make better business decisions than government bureaucrats.
But the Fed’s low-interest, non-recourse loans to buy up toxic assets have not yet caused a stampede of participants.
Will banks be willing to part with the assets at a low enough price to attract private investment?
And would doing so force larger write-downs, requiring banks, in turn, to ration credit – and thus harming the economy?
Obama has been better than feared on international trade.
He was famously protectionist during the primaries, declaring he would unilaterally rewrite NAFTA.
But, while he has continued his softer tone since the election, he has not even bothered to ask for fast-track trade-promotion authority, let alone try to pump new life into the Doha Round of global trade talks.
Obama is getting a large part of his agenda.
Unfortunately, the numbers don’t add up and he is laying twin time bombs with the explosion of federal government debt and inefficient government micromanagement of the economy.
His call for immense deficits even once the economy is back to normal, funds are returned from the financial bailouts, and the US is out of Iraq – is simply irresponsible.
The American economy will likely return to growth late this year and next, especially with all the monetary and fiscal stimulus (growth would have initially been slower and then much stronger without it), but it will still be an economy on a government lifeline.
The big questions left unanswered are how far Obama wants to push the US toward a European-style social-welfare state, how he intends to pay for it, and how much long-term economic damage will result?
Grandmasters and Global Growth
CAMBRIDGE – As the global economy limps out of the last decade and enters a new one in 2010, what will be the next big driver of global growth? Here’s betting that the “teens” is a decade in which artificial intelligence hits escape velocity, and starts to have an economic impact on par with the emergence of India and China.
Admittedly, my perspective is heavily colored by events in the world of chess, a game I once played at a professional level and still follow from a distance.
Though special, computer chess nevertheless offers both a window into silicon evolution and a barometer of how people might adapt to it.
A little bit of history might help.
In 1996 and 1997, World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov played a pair of matches against an IBM computer named “Deep Blue.” At the time, Kasparov dominated world chess, in the same way that Tiger Woods – at least until recently – has dominated golf.
In the 1996 match, Deep Blue stunned the champion by beating him in the first game. But Kasparov quickly adjusted to exploit the computer’s weakness in long-term strategic planning, where his judgment and intuition seemed to trump the computer’s mechanical counting.
Unfortunately, the supremely confident Kasparov did not take Deep Blue seriously enough in the 1997 rematch.
Deep Blue shocked the champion, winning the match 3.5 to 2.5.
Many commentators have labeled Deep Blue’s triumph one of the most important events of the twentieth century.
Perhaps Kasparov would have won the rematch had it continued to a full 24 games (then the standard length of world championship matches).
But, over the next few years, even as humans learned from computers, computers improved at a far faster pace.
With ever more powerful processors, silicon chess players developed the ability to calculate so far ahead that the distinction between short-term tactical calculations and long-term strategic planning became blurred.
At the same time, computer programs began to exploit huge databases of games between grandmaster (the highest title in chess), using results from the human games to extrapolate what moves have the highest chances of success. Soon, it became clear that even the best human chess players would have little chance to do better than an occasional draw.
Today, chess programs have become so good that even grandmasters sometimes struggle to understand the logic behind some of their moves.
In chess magazines, one often sees comments from top players such as “My silicon friend says I should have moved my King instead of my Queen, but I still think I played the best ‘human’ move.”
It gets worse. Many commercially available computer programs can be set to mimic the styles of top grandmasters to an extent that is almost uncanny.
Indeed, chess programs now come very close to passing the late British mathematician Alan Turing’s ultimate test of artificial intelligence: can a human conversing with the machine tell it is not human?
I sure can’t.
Ironically, as computer-aided cheating increasingly pervades chess tournaments (with accusations reaching the highest levels), the main detection device requires using another computer.
Only a machine can consistently tell what another computer would do in a given position. Perhaps if Turing were alive today, he would define artificial intelligence as the inability of a computer to tell whether another machine is human!
So has all this put chess players out of work?
Encouragingly, the answer is “not yet.” In fact, in some ways, chess is as popular and successful today as at any point in the last few decades. Chess lends itself very well to Internet play, and fans can follow top-level tournaments in real time, often with commentary.
Technology has helped thoroughly globalize chess, with the Indian Vishy Anand now the first Asian world champion, and the handsome young Norwegian Magnus Carlsen having reached rock-star status. Man and machine have learned to co-exist, for now.
Of course, this is a microcosm of the larger changes that we can expect.
The horrible computerized telephone-answering systems that we all now suffer with might actually improve.
Imagine, someday you might actually prefer digital to human operators.
In 50 years, computers might be doing everything from driving taxis to performing routine surgery.
Sooner than that, artificial intelligence will transform higher learning, potentially making a world-class university education broadly affordable even in poor developing countries.
And, of course, there are more mundane but crucial uses of artificial intelligence everywhere, from managing the electronics and lighting in our homes to populating “smart grids” for water and electricity, helping monitor these and other systems to reduce waste.
In short, I do not share the view of many that, after the Internet and the personal computer, it will be a long wait until the next paradigm-shifting innovation.
Artificial intelligence will provide the boost that keeps the teens rolling.
So, despite a rough start from the financial crisis (which will still slow global growth this year and next), there is no reason why the new decade has to be an economic flop.
Barring another round of deep financial crises, it won’t be – as long as politicians do not stand in the way of the new paradigm of trade, technology, and artificial intelligence.
The Grassroots of Climate Change
PARIS – The climate-change agreement reached here on December 12 was a rich victory for diplomacy.
Both the agreement itself and the atmosphere of cooperation that permeated the proceedings represent a sea change from the failed Copenhagen summit in 2009.
But while we should congratulate world leaders on their success, Paris marks the beginning, not the end, of the road.
It is now our collective duty to hold our leaders to account and ensure that they turn promises into action – especially in the world’s most vulnerable regions, such as Africa.
We should applaud China, India, the United States, and the European Union for their pre-Paris pledges on climate action.
These countries’ commitments created the sense of responsibility, trust, and solidarity that enabled 195 nations not merely to agree on a one-off deal, but to set in motion a series of increasingly ambitious five-year cycles to phase out greenhouse-gas emissions this century.
This is a clear signal that the carbon era has reached a turning point; as a result, there will be more investment in renewable energy.
Countries also promised to work harder to protect the world’s most vulnerable, by aiming to limit average global warming to as little as 1.5º Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
And developed countries pledged at least $100 billion of annual climate finance to help the least developed countries cut their carbon emissions and prepare for climate change.
For the first time, an international agreement offers the least developed countries funds to cover some of the loss and damage caused by climate shocks.
But in order to fulfill the Paris agreement, we must ensure that governments keep their promises.
National emissions targets are voluntary, rather than inscribed in the agreement, so they are not legally binding.
In hard, practical terms, there is not yet anything specific to slow the extraction of fossil fuels or stop high-polluting countries from using coal for electricity.
Developed countries made no individual commitments, and the starting year for funding adaptation assistance remains unclear.
We must keep the pressure on to make sure that the promised climate finance is sufficient to enable the least-developed countries to adapt to present and future climate change.
All of this must happen urgently.
The cumulative effect of previous decades of emissions means that there will be no chance for a last-minute solution.
In Africa, climate change may already be responsible for falling water levels in West African rivers; declining coral reefs in tropical waters; lower fruit production in the Sahel; fewer fish in the Great Lakes region; and the spread of malaria in the Kenyan uplands.
Without significant cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, we will see far worse.
By threatening basic human needs, such as food and water, climate change will be a catalyst for instability, migration, and conflict.
Africa will pay a heavy price.
Fortunately, we now know that we can prevent catastrophic climate change while still providing the energy needed to sustain economic growth, create jobs, and lift millions of people out of poverty.
The many benefits of pursuing a low-carbon development path include not only cleaner air and better energy security, but also the opportunities that arise from decentralized and renewable power.
These opportunities are particularly crucial for Africa, where more than 620 million people live without electricity.
The falling cost of solar power, batteries, and LED lighting means that renewable sources can now provide affordable, modern energy.
In Kenya, for example, Maasai women in Magadi who have been trained to install solar power have brought electricity to 2,000 households in just two years.
But to realize this economic and social potential, African leaders must combat corruption.
They must make the management of their utilities more transparent, strengthen regulations, and increase public spending on energy infrastructure.
Investment and external financing must follow.
This is not a question of aid, but of fairness, given that Africa contributes so little to global emissions but stands to suffer the most from climate change.
Investing in low-carbon energy also makes sound business sense: It boosts technology companies and promotes social entrepreneurship globally.
I am pleased that two initiatives launched in Paris will take us farther down the renewable-energy path.
Europe and Canada pledged $10 billion toward an ambitious project called the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative, which aims to install ten gigawatts of solar, wind, and geothermal capacity by the end of the decade.
And France and India launched the International Solar Alliance to raise more than $1 trillion by 2030 to deploy solar power in more than 100 developing countries.
The Paris agreement has drawn the first broad strokes of a solution to climate change.
But until its targets are translated into action, the world’s least-developed countries may not be convinced that the developed countries are serious about equity – or “climate justice.”
For Africa, 2015 must be a turning point.
If the world’s citizens hold their leaders to account for the targets they have set, it will be.
Quite simply, the historic responsibility for the planet’s future rests on the shoulders of us all.
Revanchist China
SYDNEY – In a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC, on February 22, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe informed the audience of officials, experts, and journalists that Japan is “back” and will not stand down in its ongoing sovereignty dispute with China over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands.
With Chinese provocations on the rise, US President Barack Obama, Abe’s host, appealed for calm and restraint on both sides.
Japan is likely to accede – grudgingly – to America’s request, as it remains dependent on its alliance with the US for its security.
But it will be much more difficult to persuade China that it should stand down.
China’s assertiveness over its sovereignty claim reflects more than a desire to exploit seabed resources, or to gain a widened strategic gateway into the western Pacific.
It is also about national renewal and rejuvenation – the core of the Chinese Communist Party’s raison d’être.
Turning away from a fight with its former occupier and historical rival would be a step backward in this six-decade-long quest.
The idea of Chinese renewal or rejuvenation was popularized by then-Premier Zhao Ziyang in the late 1980’s, and frequently promoted by Presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao.
Most recently, incoming President Xi Jinping, visiting the National Museum of China’s “Road Toward Renewal” exhibition, pledged to continue the “great renewal of the Chinese nation.”
What does “renewal” or “rejuvenation” mean to the Chinese?
All nations – great and small – embody a combination of historical fact and myth.
In this case, the CCP’s view of rejuvenation is built on the belief that the zenith of Chinese power under the Ming and Qing dynasties represents the natural, just, and permanent state of affairs for a 5,000-year-old civilization.
When Mao Zedong took power in 1949, his immediate goal was to re-establish the “greater China” of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), insisting that the Manchu-led empire was the permanent and enduring China.
But, while the assault on the Qing Dynasty by foreign powers is a historical fact, the notion that there has been one enduring China struggling against avaricious outsiders across several millennia is false and self-serving.
Mao achieved his goal following the so-called peaceful liberation of the East Turkestan Republic (now Xinjiang) in 1949 and the invasion of Tibet in 1950, which promptly increased China’s size by more than one-third.
And every CCP leader since has carried forward his vision of a greater China, adjusting and expanding it as the country’s power grows.
For example, China showed little interest in the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands prior to 1968 – the year a geographical study pointed to vast oil reserves beneath the seabed.
The same can be said for China’s growing stridency with respect to its claims in the South China Sea.
In 2009, relying heavily on a dubious historical claim, China formally tabled its “nine-dotted line” map to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, and has since referred to almost all of the South China Sea as being under its “indisputable sovereignty.”
Having dominated East and Southeast Asia for all but the last two centuries of the past two millennia, China is chafing at the current US-led regional order of sovereign states, in which even the smallest enjoys the same rights, privileges, and protection as the largest.
Modern China has benefited enormously from this arrangement; nonetheless, there is keen resentment that the Chinese civilization-state’s vast achievements over several thousand years offer China no special status.
To a people imbued with a deep sense of superior moral worth, historical achievement, and victimization by foreign powers, this state of affairs is unjust and unnatural.
It follows that pulling back from any territorial dispute with smaller and inferior states would be seen as a humiliating defeat, rather than a step toward ensuring long-term regional stability.
Moreover, an expanding view of greater China implies that a resolution of the dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in China’s favor would be likely to embolden rather than satisfy its ambitions.
Making good on its claim to the South China Sea could be next.
As Obama and Abe forge a common strategy aimed at helping to manage China’s rise peacefully, they must understand that China’s conception of renewal seeks to resurrect a glorious past, and that this implies revision, not affirmation, of the existing regional order.
This means that they will have to limit China’s strategic and military options, even if they cannot constrain its ambitions.
Greece and the Limits of Anti-Austerity
CAMBRIDGE – Is austerity dead?
At last month’s G-8 meeting at Camp David, the German-led austerity program for the eurozone’s troubled southern members ran up against substantial resistance.
Likewise, France’s recent presidential election bolstered those who argue that Europe must grow its way out of its debt-heavy public sector, rather than aim for immediate fiscal orthodoxy.
And there is no guarantee that Greece’s newly elected center-right New Democracy party, which favors honoring the country’s bailout terms, will be able to form a majority government.
The United States, by contrast, has pursued expansionary and growth-oriented macroeconomic policies since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, despite massive budget deficits.
Thus far, judging from the modest recovery in the US versus non-recovery in Europe, American policy accommodation is performing better than European austerity.
But simply choosing between expansion and austerity is not the whole story.
Macroeconomic policies interact with on-the-ground microeconomic realities in subtle but powerful, rarely remarked-upon ways.
Simply put, Europe’s microeconomic structure makes the same growth-based macroeconomic policies less effective in the European Union than in the US.
Here’s why: macroeconomic easing, by lowering interest rates or otherwise pumping money into the economy, aims to increase economic activity.
With more money moving around, businesses rehire employees and ask existing employees to work more hours.
Entrepreneurs considering whether or not to start a business decide to proceed, and their bank lends them the money to make the new business viable.
The newly hired workers and newly formed businesses spend money, which induces more hiring, more start-ups, and yet more spending.
The economy grows, yielding higher tax revenues, thereby helping governments to put their fiscal house in order.
The country grows its way out of its economic problems.
But the EU cannot realize this scenario as easily as the US can, because micro-level rules in the EU generate friction that slows that kind of an expansion.
The EU’s stricter labor rules are a well-known and often-cited example.
European labor-market rigidities mean that it is difficult in many EU countries to downsize a company.
Anticipating that difficulty, companies are less willing to hire in the first place, until they are sure that long-term demand for their products is sufficient to justify long-term hires.
Hence, even if businesses get easier access to money and loans, many firms will still decline to hire on a large scale, fearing that they would be saddled with a large payroll in a future downturn.
For example, The Economist’s recent portrait of Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti shows that Italy continues to be stymied by labor rules that make businesses reluctant to expand beyond 15 employees (after which it becomes hard for a firm to downsize).
To work smoothly, expansive macroeconomic policies require compatible microeconomic rules.
There is some irony in the fact that the strongest proponent of austerity has been German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, because Germany, particularly under her predecessor Gerhard Schroeder’s Social Democrat-led government, did much more to liberalize the country’s rules for labor and business than other EU governments.
Expansive, growth-based policy could work better in Germany than in many eurozone countries for which it is being prescribed.
Rules that impede business start-ups may be an even more important obstacle to making monetary expansion effective.
It is simply too difficult to launch many types of businesses in many places, and to expand those that are started.
Necessary licenses are often not routinely obtained. The simple start-up paperwork is still more burdensome than it is in the US.
Indeed, while this process has become easier in Europe in recent years, the World Bank estimates that it still takes twice as long to start up a small business in Greece and much of the rest of the EU as it does in the US – and four times as long in Spain.
While the relative absence of Facebook-style mega-entrepreneurial successes in Europe is regularly bemoaned, the difficulties of opening hairdressers, basic retailers, and simple mail-order businesses may have an equally profound overall effect.
Consider taxi licensing.
Many people can drive a cab, including many who are unemployed, but not so many can get permission to do so in many major cities in Europe and the US.
Imagine much of the economy organized like the taxi industry.
Most kinds of economic stimulus won’t generate more taxis, until entry restrictions are reduced.
Magda Bianco, Silvia Giacomelli, and Giacomo Rodano, researchers at the Bank of Italy, report that these institutional roadblocks to expansion remain substantial in Italy.
A factory might get easier access to funds, and it might see more demand for its products, but, rather than hiring new workers, it might decide to raise its prices.
A potential competitor might consider entering that market; but, given substantial regulatory entry barriers, it might ultimately decide to remain in its current business.
Expansionary monetary policy in such an environment might fail.
Perhaps for this reason, France’s new president, François Hollande, favors using the government to direct specific outcomes – for example, by hiring 60,000 new teachers.
One can imagine a grand bargain in Europe, with expansionary macroeconomic policies coupled with the easing of microeconomic impediments.
But existing businesses and already-employed workers prefer the status quo, and can powerfully inhibit policymakers.
There may be more than a little of this in Greek politics, and that of other EU countries.
Greece, Argentina, and the Middle-Income Trap
SANTIAGO – Aside from an established tradition of bad macroeconomics, what do Greece and Argentina have in common?
One answer is that they were the world’s longest-held captives of the so-called middle-income trap – and remain within its reach to this day.
With countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin American fearing that, having reached the international middle class, they could be stuck there, Greece and Argentina shed light on how that might happen.
A recent paper by economists from Bard College and the Asian Development Bank categorizes the world economy according to four groups – with the top two categories occupied by upper-middle-income and high-income countries – and tracks countries’ movements in and out of these groups.
Which countries were stuck for the longest period in the upper-middle-income category before moving to high income?
You guessed it: Greece and Argentina.
Correcting for variations in the cost of living across countries, the paper concludes that $10,750 of purchasing power in the year 1990 is the threshold for per capita income beyond which a country is high income, while $7,250 makes it upper-middle income.
(These thresholds may sound low, but the World Bank uses similar cutoffs.)
By these criteria, Argentina became an upper-middle-income country all the way back in 1970, and then spent 40 years stuck in that category before reaching high-income status in 2010.
Greece joined the international upper middle class in 1972, and then took 28 years to reach the top income group, in 2000.
No other country that became upper middle income after 1950, and then made the transition, took nearly as long.
In fact, the average length of that transition was 14 years, with economies such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong taking as little as seven years.
Data in the paper stop at 2010, but the story may well be worse today.
According to IMF figures, Greece’s never-ending crisis has cut per capita GDP (in terms of purchasing power parity) by 10% since 2010, and by 18% since 2007.
Indeed, Greece may have dropped out of the high-income category in recent years.
Argentina’s per capita income has risen, albeit slowly, during this period, but the country was never far from a full-blown macroeconomic crisis that could reduce household incomes sharply.
So it seems fair to conclude that both countries are still caught in the middle-income trap.
What kind of trap is it?
In Greece and Argentina, it is both political and economic.
Start with the politics.
In their book Why Nations Fail, Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson argue that societies with political arrangements that concentrate power in the hands of a few seldom excel at innovation and growth, because innovators have no guarantee they will keep the fruits of their labors.
And, to the extent that outsiders cannot generate wealth, they have few resources with which to challenge the power of insiders; as a result, exclusionary political arrangements are mostly self-sustaining.
That is a useful account of why there is a poverty trap – which is the question the book seeks to answer – but it does not clarify why there is a middle-income trap.
Greece and Argentina are, after all, democracies, however imperfect, and so are most of the countries in Latin America or East Asia that worry about being stuck at middle-income level.
The Acemoglu-Robinson account of a single small elite pulling all the strings needs to be replaced by a different narrative, in which an array of politically powerful groups exercise veto power over decisions that affect their economic interests.
Think of powerful business groups vetoing moves to improve tax collection or strengthen competition policy.
This helps explain why the Greek and Argentine governments are perennially in deficit (until borrowing options dry up and adjustment is inevitable), or why prices – and profits – are high in sectors (for example, transportation and telecoms) that provide would-be entrepreneurs with crucial (but often unaffordable) inputs.
Or think of public-sector unions vetoing changes in benefits for their members.
That goes a long way toward explaining (add a bit of ideology to the mix) why the current Greek government has gone to the brink of default before agreeing to restrain public-sector pensions, as its European Union partners demand.
It also helps explain why both Greece and Argentina have sizeable governments (public spending accounts for 46% and 39% of GDP, respectively) but puny public investment and outdated infrastructure.
This is not a case of too much democracy, as conservative commentators sometimes claim, but of too little.
Underdeveloped democratic institutions allow for decisions that are individually rational but collectively shortsighted and harmful.
And bad politics makes for bad economics.
To go from middle-income to high-income status, countries have to redeploy resources to high-productivity, knowledge- and skill-intensive sectors.
That is a transition that Greece and Argentina, with their financial instability, poor infrastructure, and weak education systems, have never made.
Greece exports refined petroleum products, olive oil, raw cotton, and dried fruit.
Argentina exports corn, soybeans, fruits, and wine – as well as cars and auto parts to the rest of the regional Mercosur trade bloc, where it enjoys ample tariff protection against third-country competition.
According to the Atlas of Economic Complexity, developed by Ricardo Hausmann and colleagues at Harvard University, the 2008 gap between Greece’s income and the knowledge content of its exports was the largest in a sample of 128 countries.
By 2013, Greece ranked 48th in the Atlas’s index of complexity of exports – by far the lowest of any developed country in Europe – while Argentina ranked 67th.
Sluggish exports mean slow growth, which in turn places limits on social mobility and the expansion of an entrepreneurial middle class.
That helps preserve the political power of entrenched veto-wielding players, closing the trap.
Perhaps a weighty tome entitled Why Middle-Income Nations Fail will tell the story in full.
Societies will then understand why high-income status eludes them – and what they might do differently.
Europe’s Last Act?
NEW YORK – European Union leaders continue to play a game of brinkmanship with the Greek government.
Greece has met its creditors’ demands far more than halfway.
Yet Germany and Greece’s other creditors continue to demand that the country sign on to a program that has proven to be a failure, and that few economists ever thought could, would, or should be implemented.
The swing in Greece’s fiscal position from a large primary deficit to a surplus was almost unprecedented, but the demand that the country achieve a primary surplus of 4.5% of GDP was unconscionable.
Unfortunately, at the time that the “troika” – the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund – first included this irresponsible demand in the international financial program for Greece, the country’s authorities had no choice but to accede to it.
The folly of continuing to pursue this program is particularly acute now, given the 25% decline in GDP that Greece has endured since the beginning of the crisis.
The troika badly misjudged the macroeconomic effects of the program that they imposed.
According to their published forecasts, they believed that, by cutting wages and accepting other austerity measures, Greek exports would increase and the economy would quickly return to growth.
They also believed that the first debt restructuring would lead to debt sustainability.
The troika’s forecasts have been wrong, and repeatedly so.
And not by a little, but by an enormous amount.
Greece’s voters were right to demand a change in course, and their government is right to refuse to sign on to a deeply flawed program.
Having said that, there is room for a deal: Greece has made clear its willingness to engage in continued reforms, and has welcomed Europe’s help in implementing some of them.
A dose of reality on the part of Greece’s creditors – about what is achievable, and about the macroeconomic consequences of different fiscal and structural reforms – could provide the basis of an agreement that would be good not only for Greece, but for all of Europe.
Some in Europe, especially in Germany, seem nonchalant about a Greek exit from the eurozone.
The market has, they claim, already “priced in” such a rupture.
Some even suggest that it would be good for the monetary union.
I believe that such views significantly underestimate both the current and future risks involved.
A similar degree of complacency was evident in the United States before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
The fragility of America’s banks had been known for a long time – at least since the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns the previous March.
Yet, given the lack of transparency (owing in part to weak regulation), both markets and policymakers did not fully appreciate the linkages among financial institutions.
Indeed, the world’s financial system is still feeling the aftershocks of the Lehman collapse.
And banks remain non-transparent, and thus at risk.
We still don’t know the full extent of linkages among financial institutions, including those arising from non-transparent derivatives and credit default swaps.
In Europe, we can already see some of the consequences of inadequate regulation and the flawed design of the eurozone itself.
We know that the structure of the eurozone encourages divergence, not convergence: as capital and talented people leave crisis-hit economies, these countries become less able to repay their debts.
As markets grasp that a vicious downward spiral is structurally embedded in the euro, the consequences for the next crisis become profound.
And another crisis in inevitable: it is in the very nature of capitalism.
ECB President Mario Draghi’s confidence trick, in the form of his declaration in 2012 that the monetary authorities would do “whatever it takes” to preserve the euro, has worked so far.
But the knowledge that the euro is not a binding commitment among its members will make it far less likely to work the next time.
Bond yields could spike, and no amount of reassurance by the ECB and Europe’s leaders would suffice to bring them down from stratospheric levels, because the world now knows that they will not do “whatever it takes.”
As the example of Greece has shown, they will do only what short-sighted electoral politics demands.
The most important consequence, I fear, is the weakening of European solidarity.
The euro was supposed to strengthen it.
Instead, it has had the opposite effect.
It is not in the interest of Europe – or the world – to have a country on Europe’s periphery alienated from its neighbors, especially now, when geopolitical instability is already so evident.
The neighboring Middle East is in turmoil; the West is attempting to contain a newly aggressive Russia; and China, already the world’s largest source of savings, the largest trading country, and the largest overall economy (in terms of purchasing power parity), is confronting the West with new economic and strategic realities.
This is no time for European disunion.
Europe’s leaders viewed themselves as visionaries when they created the euro.
They thought they were looking beyond the short-term demands that usually preoccupy political leaders.
Unfortunately, their understanding of economics fell short of their ambition; and the politics of the moment did not permit the creation of the institutional framework that might have enabled the euro to work as intended.
Although the single currency was supposed to bring unprecedented prosperity, it is difficult to detect a significant positive effect for the eurozone as a whole in the period before the crisis.
In the period since, the adverse effects have been enormous.
The future of Europe and the euro now depends on whether the eurozone’s political leaders can combine a modicum of economic understanding with a visionary sense of, and concern for, European solidarity.
We are likely to begin finding out the answer to that existential question in the next few weeks.
Europe’s Greek Failure
BRUSSELS – Narratives matter, especially when they are intertwined with hard interests.
As Greece and its creditors court catastrophe, we are getting a clear picture of how conflicting narratives can lead to a lose-lose result.
The facts are indisputable.
In early 2010, when the Greek government could no longer finance itself, it turned to its European partners and the International Monetary Fund for financial support.
And they delivered: not only did other eurozone countries issue loans to Greece, but the IMF provided its largest-ever loan to the country.
Later, Greece received even more support through the eurozone’s bailout funds.
The result was hundreds of billions of euros worth of assistance.
But, as time progressed, Greece and its creditors came to view these facts very differently.
As Greece’s economic situation deteriorated, its citizens got the sense that the loans were not really intended to help them, but rather to bail out German and French banks.
With this narrative, Greeks could avoid admitting the role of their own government’s policy mistakes in thrusting them into recession.
Greece’s creditors, by contrast, felt that they had generously saved a profligate country from bankruptcy.
This narrative allowed policymakers in Germany to disregard the fact that their country’s banks had financed Greek borrowing for too long.
Both narratives contain a large amount of truth, but conveniently overlook some important facts.
For instance, a substantial share of the loans given to Greece until early 2012 was indeed used to pay off maturing debt.
But it is likely that the holders of the debt were no longer French or German banks – who for the most part would have been unable to bear the uncertainty that preceded the 2012 bailout and haircut on Greek debt.
By the time the eurozone governments intervened decisively, most French and German banks had largely unloaded their holdings at a loss to hedge funds and other investors with a greater appetite for risk.
Whatever debt they had held onto lost more than half its value in the haircut.
Given this, it cannot be said that French and German banks did not suffer losses.
Similarly, the creditor countries were right that they had helped Greece, a country that had undeniably overspent for years.
Their financial assistance allowed Greece to reduce its fiscal deficits more slowly than if it had simply gone bankrupt in 2010, as it enabled the country to remain connected to financial markets.
In the first quarter of last year, Greece actually experienced a slight uptick in growth and a small decline in unemployment.
What the creditors overlooked was that, over time, the pain of austerity began – in the minds of many Greeks – to outweigh the benefits of their assistance.
Until a few months ago, it still looked as if Greece could achieve a primary surplus, albeit a small one, this year.
When the country turned to its creditors for help, it was only because it could not cover some large payments on maturing loans.
Greece had ceased to be a “bottomless pit.”
With a bit of financial engineering, Greece’s creditors could have postponed some of the payments the country owed this year – payments that, it should be noted, everyone knew it would not be able to repay at this stage – and enabled it to continue its gradual recovery.
Instead, these clashing narratives created a deleterious spiral, fanning the flames of animosity and leading to the election of a left-wing government in Greece with a mandate to oppose austerity – with disastrous results for both sides.
Rather than help Greece make its payments, the creditors reacted by imposing tough conditions for a new loan that would be used only to repay debts that they themselves held – a point that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras emphasized in his last proposal.
And yet, blaming the creditors for their “punitive” conditions, as Greek negotiators have done, would also be a mistake, for this simplistic narrative too obscures a complicated truth.
Right before the talks were abruptly cut off for Greece to hold its referendum, the two sides had agreed on fiscal targets for Greece; all that was left was to determine how the targets should be reached.
The Greek government wanted to raise some taxes.
Its creditors believed that this approach would stifle growth even more, so they advocated increasing the tax base, such as by eliminating the lower value-added tax rates enjoyed by Greek islands, instead.
Though the creditors’ logic was sound and their intentions laudable, the Greek side believed that such a condition would amount to an affront to their country’s sovereignty.
With that, their narrative morphed into one of national pride.
It was a classic “prisoner’s dilemma.”
Both sides have known throughout the tortuous negotiations of recent months that failure to reach an agreement would benefit no one.
Greece’s economy would contract even further, and its creditors would have to accept even larger write-offs.
But the two sides have remained locked in their respective narratives – narratives that the recent cutoff of negotiations and hastily arranged referendum have reinforced.
Now, the Greek electorate is rejecting the creditors’ demands in the name of national pride, democracy, and sovereignty; the creditors are angry not only at their attitude, but also at their government’s unreliability.
Saving Greece was always going to be difficult, given its previous fiscal excesses and weak economy.
But last year, it seemed that success was within reach – until the clash of narratives derailed the progress the two sides had made.
This highlights a larger problem: the European Union lacks a unifying narrative strong enough to prevent the emergence of conflicting – and highly destructive – narratives within its borders.
In this sense, the failure to save Greece amounts to a failure of Europe.
Getting Personal With the Greek Crisis
BERLIN – Today’s decision-makers are supposed to embrace the virtues of big data, relentlessly pursue quantitative metrics, and then adhere to the optimal course of action that these powerful tools supposedly indicate.
Yet if there is one thing that the Greek crisis has made clear, it is the importance of the human factor in negotiations.
People and their personalities, and the way they perceive one another, can make small debts seem unserviceable or large debts disappear with a handshake.
In a world that feels increasingly unstable, many seek reassurance in the illusion of certainty that data provide.
We want it in our journalism.
We want it in our investment decisions.
We even want gadgets that count our every step and heartbeat.
We want to bring our wellbeing and our future fully under our control.
But the Greek financial crisis serves as a reminder that life is not governed by data alone.
In the end, outcomes may – and often do – depend on the amorphous yet essential qualities of integrity, trustworthiness, and interpersonal “chemistry.”
The importance of such factors was no less clear in the negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program.
Whereas partisan grandstanding and nationalist posturing in the Greek negotiations have eroded confidence in the entire European project, the negotiators on the Iran deal overcame an even deeper trust gap.
With arguably more at stake, and despite the involvement of more players with overlapping and, at times, antagonistic agendas, entrusting the process to professional diplomats, rather than elected politicians, clearly paid off.
There is an important lesson here for Europe.
People selected to lead countries or companies must have the technical competence – and the number-crunching support teams – needed to make good decisions.
But that is never enough.
Effective leaders must be able not only to represent a point of view, but also to work well with others to realize their vision.
If deals – whether on bailout arrangements, nuclear programs, or corporate mergers – could be concluded on the basis of quantitative data alone, they would be.
But they never are.
For Greece and its creditors now, the latest agreement is only the first step.
The six months of finger pointing and brinkmanship that preceded the deal have created a mountain of mistrust among leaders and citizens alike.
When multiple ceasefire agreements fail in South Sudan and eastern Ukraine, or a humanitarian truce in Yemen collapses within hours, one or more of the parties is said to lack “credible commitment.”
Similarly, when the Greek side proposes essentially the same deal that it just called a snap referendum to reject, or when the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, following Germany’s lead, simply ignores the unsustainability of Greece’s debt, the ability to execute any deal must be in doubt.
What will make this deal work is quick ratification and credible follow-through in terms of day-to-day implementation.
Both sides need incentives to stick with it and deterrents to defecting from it.
Above all, conditioning further, essential debt relief for Greece on its execution of the deal should be used as a way to commit both sides.
A track record of failed implementation – of accepting bailouts without implementing the reforms needed to regain solvency – creates a climate in which deal making becomes ever more difficult.
The risks are too high, especially when every development in the talks is spun for partisan advantage, to make leaders look smart, to label winners and losers, or to undermine progress by nit-picking the data.
It is to the credit of European leaders involved in the negotiations that they have been able to reach a deal in the face of enormous uncertainty.
They have committed not just financial resources but also significant political capital at a make-or-break moment for Europe.
Given the lack of trust between the parties to the deal, the situation will remain extremely volatile for some time.
Quantitative data will be necessary to monitor Greece’s progress on carrying out the agreed reforms, as well as to determine the extent of further debt relief.
But neither Greece nor Europe will regain a sense of stability merely because the data add up.
Their leaders’ personal qualities – their unshakable will and determination to make the deal stick – must add up, too.
Greece’s Imperfect Imperative
LONDON – Greece and its creditors are now enacting a deal that provides financial support in exchange for wide-ranging reforms.
Although reservations about the agreement abound, political conditions did not permit a better one.
But the deal can – and must – serve as the basis for saving Greece and the eurozone.
For the plan to work, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras must show real commitment to a reform program in which neither he nor many Greek citizens believe.
And he must forge an alliance with Greece’s pro-European parties, because only a united government will be able to deliver.
The creditors must find the money to fund the bailout.
And the International Monetary Fund must agree with the Eurogroup on how to restore debt sustainability in Greece, a precondition for the country to regain access to capital markets.
In this effort, a critical distinction must be made: though Greece has committed to deep and rapid reform, it must not be forced into hurried fiscal consolidation.
Indeed, such an approach could undermine urgently needed structural reforms, not least by destroying the political capital required to enact them.
Unfortunately, the recent agreement includes unrealistic proposals for fiscal adjustment.
Before Greek banks closed and capital controls were imposed in late June, the European Commission put the primary budget deficit for this year at €4-6 billion ($4.3-6.5 billion), or 2-3% of GDP.
Now, it looks like the primary deficit (which excludes interest payments) could reach 6% of GDP, with GDP falling by 4%.
Yet the new deal anticipates that Greece will make up for the year’s fiscal shortfall in just five months.
As Greece and other eurozone countries have already learned, attempting to rush fiscal adjustment increases the debt burden, as the liquidity squeeze and concomitant uncertainty undermine output and reform efforts.
For example, one of the key initiatives to address the fiscal shortfall is an increase in the value-added tax to 23% for almost all goods and services.
But with VAT evasion in Greece as high as 50%, the hike will place firms that pay, which tend to be larger and more efficient, at an even greater disadvantage relative to firms that do not.
Greece should therefore focus first on building the legal and technical infrastructure to combat tax evasion.
Greece’s government will find it hard to adhere to the new program unless its fiscal targets make sense.
Though it is politically unrealistic to renegotiate the deal at this point, a serious analysis of the necessary fiscal adjustment, possibly arbitrated by independent experts, is needed.
The IMF’s latest analysis of Greece’s debt sustainability reinforces this assessment.
Despite pressure from Germany and other countries to participate in the new bailout program, the Fund will not get involved unless it judges Greece’s debt to be sustainable.
That means making the economy’s debt stocks and fiscal flows consistent, with the right combination of tough but feasible fiscal targets and debt relief.
Fiscal discipline should not take priority over the important structural reforms included in the new deal, particularly measures to overhaul pensions, the legal system, product markets, public administration, and the judiciary.
Implementation will be very difficult even without excessively tight fiscal targets; with them, it may be impossible.
Previous attempts at pension reform, for example, have been partial and indecisive, with exceptions and grace periods undermining their effectiveness.
Similarly, though attempts to reform the code of civil procedure, aimed at improving the judicial system’s efficiency, began in 2011, little progress has been made, owing largely to the government’s failure to face down opposition from lawyers’ associations, which stand to lose their excessive fees from useless procedures.
And, although the groundwork has been laid for product-market reforms, no preparations for serious public-administration reform have been made.
The key to overcoming these challenges is for the Greek people to take ownership of the reforms, so that the public interest can prevail over vested interests.
But that, too, will be difficult, given the widespread view that the reforms are being imposed on Greece by its creditors.
Tsipras must lead the way by building a broad consensus.
The details of the reform legislation are important.
Rather than attempting to meet unfeasible deadlines, legislators should proceed with deliberate speed.
Meanwhile, Greek banks – which, given their huge volume of non-performing loans, are now more likely to be insolvent than illiquid – will require massive recapitalization, funded by the European Stability Mechanism, not the Greek state, in order to break the bank-sovereign link.
The operation might involve restructuring as well.
In this effort, there must be no bail-in of depositors, which would have damaging social consequences, or Greek state ownership of the banks, which would entrench clientelism in the financial system.
The ESM would later sell the banks in open auctions to recoup its investment.
Many in Greece, as well as some outsiders, have called the new agreement “neocolonialist oppression.”
And, indeed, Greece’s humiliation in the negotiations evoked memories of the Indonesian president’s treatment by the IMF during the Asian financial crisis of 1997.
(Some creditors feel that they are the true victims, exploited by Greek counterparts who never intended to fulfill their promises.)
But the Greeks must put aside these emotional responses and recognize the need for many of the proposed reforms.
Greece’s failure to implement them has allowed the clientelism, oligarchy, corruption, and tax evasion underpinning its economic and political dysfunction to continue practically unfettered.
The alternative is a Greek exit from the eurozone.
(German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble’s suggestion that Greece can just take a “time out” is a fiction.)
Economists who pretend that this would be anything less than an economic and political catastrophe for Greece should look closely at the structure of Greek trade, the anemic response of exports to the already huge internal devaluation, and company and household balance sheets.
Some would welcome the damage this would do to European unity; we would not.
The recent agreement is far from ideal.
But Greece and its creditors must make it work.
Saving Greece, Saving Europe
BERKELEY – Whatever one thinks about the tactics of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s government in negotiations with the country’s creditors, the Greek people deserve better than what they are being offered.
Germany wants Greece to choose between economic collapse and leaving the eurozone.
Both options would mean economic disaster; the first, if not both, would be politically disastrous as well.
When I wrote in 2007 that no member state would voluntarily leave the eurozone, I emphasized the high economic costs of such a decision.
The Greek government has shown that it understands this.
Following the referendum, it agreed to what it – and the voters – had just rejected: a set of very painful and difficult conditions.
Tsipras and his new finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, have gone to extraordinary lengths to mollify Greece’s creditors.
But when I concluded that no country would leave the eurozone, I failed to imagine that Germany would force another member out.
This, clearly, would be the effect of the politically intolerable and economically perverse conditions tabled by Germany’s finance ministry.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble’s idea of a temporary “time out” from the euro is ludicrous.
Given Greece’s collapsing economy and growing humanitarian crisis, the government will have no choice, absent an agreement, but to print money to fund basic social services.
It is inconceivable that a country in such deep distress could meet the conditions for euro adoption – inflation within 2% of the eurozone average and a stable exchange rate for two years – between now and the end of the decade.
If Grexit occurs, it will not be a holiday; it will be a retirement.
Early Monday morning, European leaders agreed to remove the reference to this “time out” from the announcement of the latest bailout deal.
But this door, having been opened, will not now be easily closed.
The Eurosystem has been rendered more fragile and subject to destabilization.
Other European finance ministers will have to answer for agreeing to forward to their leaders a provisional draft containing Schäuble’s destructive language.
Economically, the new program is perverse, because it will plunge Greece deeper into depression.
It envisages raising additional taxes, cutting pensions further, and implementing automatic spending cuts if fiscal targets are missed. But it provides no basis for recovery or growth.
The Greek economy is already in free-fall, and structural reforms alone will not reverse the downward spiral.
The agreement continues to require primary budget surpluses (net of interest payments), rising to 3.5% of GDP by 2018, which will worsen Greece’s slump.
Re-profiling the country’s debt, which is implicitly part of the agreement, will do nothing to ameliorate this, given that interest payments already are minimal through the end of the decade.
As the depression deepens, the deficit targets will be missed, triggering further spending cuts and accelerating the economy’s contraction.
Eventually, the agreement will trigger Grexit, either because the creditors withdraw their support after fiscal targets are missed, or because the Greek people rebel.
Triggering that exit is transparently Germany’s intent.
Finally, the privatization fund at the center of the new program will do nothing to encourage structural reform.
Yes, Greece needs to privatize inefficient public enterprises.
But the Greek government is being asked to privatize with a gun held to its head.
Privatization at fire-sale prices, with most of the proceeds used to pay down debt, will not put Greek parliamentarians or the public in a mood to press ahead enthusiastically with structural reform.
Greece deserves better.
It deserves a program that respects its sovereignty and allows the government to establish its credibility over time.
It deserves a program capable of stabilizing its economy rather than bleeding it to death.
And it deserves support from the ECB to enable it to remain a eurozone member.
Europe deserves better, too.
Other European countries should not in good conscience accede to this politically destructive, economically perverse program.
They should remind themselves that Greece had plenty of help from its European partners in getting to this point.
They must continue to push for a better deal.
These partners should not allow the European project to be sacrificed on the altar of German public opinion or German leaders’ insistence on “rules.”
If Germany’s government refuses to see the light, the others should find a way forward without it.
Franco-German solidarity would be irreparably damaged, but Franco-German solidarity is worth nothing if the best it can produce is this agreement.
Last but not least, the German public deserve better.
Germans deserve a leader who stands firm in the face of extremism, rather than encouraging it, whether at home or abroad.
They deserve a Europe that can play a greater role in global affairs.
Above all, given Germany’s stunning political and economic achievements since World War II, they deserve their fellow Europeans’ admiration and respect, not renewed resentment and suspicion.
A Way Out for Greece
QUITO – The Greek crisis is a tragedy for the country and a danger for the world economy.
Germany is demanding that Greece continue to service its debts in full, even though Greece is clearly broke and the International Monetary Fund has noted the need for debt relief.
The collision of reality (Greece’s insolvency) with politics (Germany’s demands) was bound to create a disaster.
And, indeed, it has: the shocking collapse this week of the Greek banking system.
Yet there still is a way out of this mess.
Greece’s debt should be cut sharply, and the country should remain within the eurozone.
In negotiations with its creditors this spring, Greece recognized this, insisting that its debt be reduced.
Germany refused.
Though the United States and the IMF privately sided with Greece, Germany prevailed, as creditors usually do.
Yet creditors sometimes prevail to their own detriment; by pushing the debtor to the breaking point, they end up bringing about a complete default.
Germany’s mistake this past week was to push the Greek economy – already in conditions rivaling those of the Great Depression – into a complete financial collapse.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble has a clear negotiating strategy, aimed at getting Greece to agree to leave the eurozone.
Unfortunately for him, Greece does not want to exit, and it cannot be forced to do so under the treaties governing the European Union.
What Greece wants is to remain in the eurozone, with a lower debt burden – a position that is both economically astute and protected by treaty.
Indeed, a euro exit would be remarkably costly for Greece, and would almost certainly create political and social chaos – and perhaps even hyperinflation – in the heart of Europe.
The value of Greek residents’ savings would be slashed, as euros were suddenly converted into New Drachmas.
The middle class would be eviscerated.
And the currency conversion would not save the country one cent with regard to its external debt, which would, of course, remain denominated in euros.
Still, Greece’s debt burden is unsustainable.
This week, Greece defaulted on its payments to the IMF, rightly choosing pensions over debt service.
The country’s creditors should now negotiate a consensual debt reduction through some combination of lower (and fixed) interest rates, reduced face value of debt, and very long maturities.
There are plenty of precedents for such a course.
Sovereign debts have been restructured hundreds, perhaps thousands, of times – including for Germany.
In fact, hardline demands by the country’s US government creditors after World War I contributed to deep financial instability in Germany and other parts of Europe, and indirectly to the rise of Adolf Hitler in 1933.
After World War II, however, Germany was the recipient of vastly wiser concessions by the US government, culminating in consensual debt relief in 1953, an action that greatly benefitted Germany and the world.
Yet Germany has failed to learn the lessons of its own history.
I propose a four-step path out of the Greek crisis.
First, I recommend that the Greek people give a resounding “No” to the creditors in the referendum on their demands this weekend.
Second, Greece should continue to withhold service on its external debts to official creditors in advance of a consensual debt restructuring later this year.
Given its great depression, Greece should use its savings to pay pensioners, provide food relief, make crucial infrastructure repairs, and direct liquidity toward the banking system.
Third, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras must use his persuasive powers to convince the public, in the style of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, that the only thing they have to fear is fear itself.
Specifically, the government should make clear to all Greeks that their euro deposits are safe; that the country will remain within the eurozone (despite the false claims by some members of the Eurogroup that a no vote means a Greek exit); and that its banks will reopen immediately after the referendum.
Finally, Greece and Germany need to come to a rapprochement soon after the referendum and agree to a package of economic reforms and debt relief.
No country – including Greece – should expect to be offered debt relief on a silver platter; relief must be earned and justified by real reforms that restore growth, to the benefit of both debtor and creditor.
And yet, a corpse cannot carry out reforms.
That is why debt relief and reforms must be offered together, not reforms “first” with some vague promises that debt relief will come in some unspecified amount at some unspecified time in the future (as some in Europe have said to Greece).
To be sure, in the Greek debacle, both sides have made countless mistakes, misjudgments, and misdeeds over the last decade, and even before.
A country does not reach Greece’s parlous state without a generation of egregious mismanagement.
But nor does a country go bankrupt without serious mistakes by its creditors – first in lending too much money, and then in demanding excessive repayments to the point of the debtor’s collapse.
With both sides at fault, it is important for them not to lose the future by squabbling endlessly over the past.
Easing Greece’s debt burden while keeping the country within the eurozone is the correct and achievable path out of the crisis, and it can be accomplished easily through a mutual accord between Germany and Greece, to which the rest of Europe will subscribe.
The result would be a win not only for those countries, but also for the world economy.
A New Deal for Greece
ATHENS – Three months of negotiations between the Greek government and our European and international partners have brought about much convergence on the steps needed to overcome years of economic crisis and to bring about sustained recovery in Greece.
But they have not yet produced a deal.
Why?
What steps are needed to produce a viable, mutually agreed reform agenda?
We and our partners already agree on much.
Greece’s tax system needs to be revamped, and the revenue authorities must be freed from political and corporate influence.
The pension system is ailing.
The economy’s credit circuits are broken.
The labor market has been devastated by the crisis and is deeply segmented, with productivity growth stalled.
Public administration is in urgent need of modernization, and public resources must be used more efficiently.
Overwhelming obstacles block the formation of new companies.
Competition in product markets is far too circumscribed.
And inequality has reached outrageous levels, preventing society from uniting behind essential reforms.
This consensus aside, agreement on a new development model for Greece requires overcoming two hurdles.
First, we must concur on how to approach Greece’s fiscal consolidation.
Second, we need a comprehensive, commonly agreed reform agenda that will underpin that consolidation path and inspire the confidence of Greek society.
Beginning with fiscal consolidation, the issue at hand concerns the method.
The “troika” institutions (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund) have, over the years, relied on a process of backward induction: They set a date (say, the year 2020) and a target for the ratio of nominal debt to national income (say, 120%) that must be achieved before money markets are deemed ready to lend to Greece at reasonable rates.
Then, under arbitrary assumptions regarding growth rates, inflation, privatization receipts, and so forth, they compute what primary surpluses are necessary in every year, working backward to the present.
The result of this method, in our government’s opinion, is an “austerity trap.”
When fiscal consolidation turns on a predetermined debt ratio to be achieved at a predetermined point in the future, the primary surpluses needed to hit those targets are such that the effect on the private sector undermines the assumed growth rates and thus derails the planned fiscal path.
Indeed, this is precisely why previous fiscal-consolidation plans for Greece missed their targets so spectacularly.
Our government’s position is that backward induction should be ditched.
Instead, we should map out a forward-looking plan based on reasonable assumptions about the primary surpluses consistent with the rates of output growth, net investment, and export expansion that can stabilize Greece’s economy and debt ratio.
If this means that the debt-to-GDP ratio will be higher than 120% in 2020, we devise smart ways to rationalize, re-profile, or restructure the debt – keeping in mind the aim of maximizing the effective present value that will be returned to Greece’s creditors.
Besides convincing the troika that our debt sustainability analysis should avoid the austerity trap, we must overcome the second hurdle: the “reform trap.”
The previous reform program, which our partners are so adamant should not be “rolled back” by our government, was founded on internal devaluation, wage and pension cuts, loss of labor protections, and price-maximizing privatization of public assets.
Our partners believe that, given time, this agenda will work.
If wages fall further, employment will rise.
The way to cure an ailing pension system is to cut pensions.
And privatizations should aim at higher sale prices to pay off debt that many (privately) agree is unsustainable.
By contrast, our government believes that this program has failed, leaving the population weary of reform.
The best evidence of this failure is that, despite a huge drop in wages and costs, export growth has been flat (the elimination of the current-account deficit being due exclusively to the collapse of imports).
Additional wage cuts will not help export-oriented companies, which are mired in a credit crunch.
And further cuts in pensions will not address the true causes of the pension system’s troubles (low employment and vast undeclared labor).
Such measures will merely cause further damage to Greece’s already-stressed social fabric, rendering it incapable of providing the support that our reform agenda desperately needs.
The current disagreements with our partners are not unbridgeable.
Our government is eager to rationalize the pension system (for example, by limiting early retirement), proceed with partial privatization of public assets, address the non-performing loans that are clogging the economy’s credit circuits, create a fully independent tax commission, and boost entrepreneurship.
The differences that remain concern how we understand the relationships between the various reforms and the macro environment.
None of this means that common ground cannot be achieved immediately.
The Greek government wants a fiscal-consolidation path that makes sense, and we want reforms that all sides believe are important.
Our task is to convince our partners that our undertakings are strategic, rather than tactical, and that our logic is sound.
Their task is to let go of an approach that has failed.
A New Deal for Debt Overhangs?
CAMBRIDGE – The International Monetary Fund’s acknowledgement that Greece’s debt is unsustainable could prove to be a watershed moment for the global financial system.
Clearly, heterodox policies to deal with high debt burdens need to be taken more seriously, even in some advanced countries.
Ever since the onset of the Greek crisis, there have been basically three schools of thought.
First, there is the view of the so-called troika (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the IMF), which holds that the eurozone’s debt-distressed periphery (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain) requires strong policy discipline to prevent a short-term liquidity crisis from morphing into a long-term insolvency problem.
The orthodox policy prescription was to extend conventional bridge loans to these countries, thereby giving them time to fix their budget problems and undertake structural reforms aimed at enhancing their long-term growth potential.
This approach has “worked” in Spain, Ireland, and Portugal, but at the cost of epic recessions. Moreover, there is a high risk of relapse in the event of a significant downturn in the global economy.
The troika policy has, however, failed to stabilize, much less revive, Greece’s economy.
A second school of thought also portrays the crisis as a pure liquidity problem, but views long-term insolvency as an outside risk at worst.
The problem is not that the debt of countries on the eurozone’s periphery is too high, but that it has not been allowed to rise nearly high enough.
This anti-austerity camp believes that even when private markets totally lost confidence in Europe’s periphery, northern Europe could easily have solved the problem by co-signing periphery debt, perhaps under the umbrella of Eurobonds backed ultimately by all (especially German) eurozone taxpayers.
The periphery countries should then have been permitted not only to roll over their debt, but also to engage in full-on countercyclical fiscal policy for as long as their national governments deemed necessary.
In other words, for “anti-austerians,” the eurozone suffered a crisis of competence, not a crisis of confidence.
Never mind that the eurozone has no centralized fiscal authority and only an incomplete banking union.
Never mind moral-hazard problems or insolvency.
And never mind growth-enhancing structural reforms.
All of the debtors will be good for the money in the future, even if they have not always been reliable in the past.
In any case, faster GDP growth will pay for everything, thanks to high fiscal multipliers.
Europe passed up a free lunch.
This is a fully coherent viewpoint, but naive in its unqualified confidence (for example, in the polemical writings of the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman).
As a result, the anti-austerian view masks strong assumptions and risks.
In fact, piling loans atop already-high debt burdens in the eurozone’s periphery entailed a significant gamble, particularly as the crisis erupted.
Political corruption, exemplified by the revolving door between Spain’s government and financial sector, was endemic.
Dual labor markets and product-market monopolies still hobble growth, and oligarchs have disproportionate power to protect their interests.
In reality, Germany could not have underwritten all of the European periphery’s debt without risking its own solvency and creditworthiness, particularly in the absence of a functioning system of eurozone-wide checks and balances.
Expansive and open-ended guarantees might have worked, but if they didn’t, the economic rot from the periphery could have spread to the center.
A third point of view is that, given the massive financial crisis, Europe’s debt problem should have been diagnosed as an insolvency problem from the start, and treated with debt restructuring and forgiveness, aided by moderately elevated inflation and structural reform.
This has been my viewpoint since the crisis began.
In Ireland and Spain, private bondholders, not Irish and Spanish taxpayers, should have taken the hit from bank failures.
In Greece, there should have been faster and larger debt write-downs.
Of course, national governments would have had to use taxpayer funds to recapitalize northern European banks – especially in France and Germany – that lent too much to the periphery.
And transfers would have been needed to recapitalize the periphery banks.
But at least then the public would have understood the reality of the situation, while restructured and recapitalized banks would have been in a position to start lending again.
Unfortunately, too many policymakers in advanced economies allowed themselves to believe that such heterodox policies are only for emerging markets.
In fact, advanced countries have resorted to heterodox policies to reduce debt overhangs on many occasions.
Debt restructuring would have given Europe the reset it needed.
Yes, there would have been risks, as IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard has pointed out, but running those risks would have been well worth it.
So what is the way forward?
Deeper European integration, stricter equity requirements for banks, and deeper but homegrown structural reforms are certainly key elements of any solution.
Further aid to the European periphery is still badly needed.
But, beyond that, Europe’s experience ought to spur a full rethink of the global system for administering sovereign bankruptcies.
That could mean bringing back older IMF proposals for a sovereign bankruptcy mechanism, or finding ways to institutionalize the Fund’s recent stance on Greek debt.
There is no free lunch in Europe, and there never was; but there are much better ways to deal with unsustainable debt.
How Europe’s Band-Aid Ensures Greece’s Bondage
ATHENS – Greece’s never-ending public-debt saga has come to signify the European Union’s inept handling of its inevitable eurozone crisis.
Eight years after its bankruptcy, the Greek state’s persistent insolvency remains an embarrassment for Europe’s officialdom.
That seems to be why, after having declared the euro crisis over in the rest of Europe, the authorities seem determined to declare final victory on the Greek front, too.
The big moment, it is said, will come in August, when Greece will be pronounced a “normal” European country again.
Recently, in preparation for the government’s return to the money markets – from which it has been effectively excluded since 2010 – Greece’s public-debt authority has been testing the waters with a long-term bond issue.
Unfortunately, all the happy talk about impending “debt relief” and a “clean exit” from Greece’s third “bailout” obscures an uglier truth: the country’s debt bondage is being extended to 2060.
And, by ossifying Greece’s insolvency, while pretending to have overcome it, Europe’s establishment is demonstrating its dogged refusal to address the eurozone’s underlying fault lines.
This augurs ill for all Europeans.
For an EU country to be considered “normal,” it should be subject to the scrutiny facing countries that were never bailed out.
That means the standard twice-yearly checks of compliance with the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact, as performed by the European Commission under the so-called European Semester procedure.
Nevertheless, for countries like Ireland or Portugal, a tougher “post-program surveillance” procedure was designed following their bailouts: quarterly checks conducted not only by the European Commission but also by the European Central Bank.
It is plain to see why Greece’s road will be much bumpier than Ireland’s or Portugal’s.
The ECB had already begun purchasing Irish and Portuguese debt in the secondary markets well before these countries’ bailout exit, as part of its “quantitative easing” program.
This enabled the Irish and Portuguese governments to issue large quantities of new debt at low interest rates.
Greece was never included the ECB’s quantitative easing program, for two reasons: its debt burden was too large to service in the long term, even with the help of ECB-sponsored low interest rates, and the ECB was under pressure, mainly from Germany, to wind down the program.
Moreover, the post-program surveillance procedure does not give the “troika” of official creditors – the European Commission, the ECB, and the International Monetary Fund – the leverage over Greece that they desire.
In celebrating Greece’s “clean exit,” while retaining its iron grip on the Greek government and withholding debt restructuring, Europe’s establishment is once again displaying its skill at inventing neologisms.
Until 75% of Greece’s public debt is repaid – in 2060, at the earliest – the country, we are told, will be subject to “enhanced surveillance” (a term with unfortunate echoes of “enhanced interrogation”).
In practice, this means 42 years of quarterly reviews, during which the European Commission and the ECB “in collaboration with the IMF” may impose new “measures” on Greece (such as austerity, fire sales of public property, and restrictions on organized labor).
In short, the next two generations of Greeks will grow up with the troika and its “process” (perhaps under a different name) as a permanent fixture of life.
The celebration of Greece’s return to normality began a few weeks ago with the government’s oversubscribed €3 billion ($3.7 billion) issue of its first seven-year bond in years.
What the revelers failed to note, however, was that, to borrow that €3 billion on behalf of its creditors, the Greek state added €816 million in interest payments to its debt repayments for 2025.
Germany’s cost for rolling over the same sum, on the same day, was a mere €63 million.
Will Greece’s income rise by a similar amount between now and 2025 to make this sustainable?
The official answer is that debt relief will come soon, paving the way for Greece’s smooth return to the money markets.
But European officials have ruled out restructuring debt that cannot be repaid.
What debt relief really means is that repayment will be shifted from 2022-2035 to 2035-2060, with interest added.
In other words, Greece will gain easier medium-term repayments in exchange of 40 years of debt serfdom.
Back in 2015, I was pushing for substantive debt restructuring by means of linking the volume of debt and the rate of repayment to the size of Greece’s nominal GDP and its rate of growth, respectively.
Now, it seems that the idea of nominal GDP-indexing will be revived, but only to determine the extent to which medium-term repayment is pushed into the future.
Moreover, the easier medium-term payments will be made contingent not only on growth, but also on new “conditionalities” (read: austerity measures) imposed by the (renamed) troika.
According to the authorities’ propaganda, Greece’s creditors are linking debt repayments to growth.
In reality, the prospect of recovery will be dealt another blow, because long-term investors will be deterred by the combination of prolonged insolvency and protracted austerity.
What accounts for this implacable determination to leave the Greek wound festering under a flimsily applied Band-Aid?
The answer lies in France and Germany, where, a decade after the 2008 financial crash exposed the eurozone’s design flaws, there is still no consensus about how to manage the large-scale insolvencies that are inevitable in a currency union lacking any mechanism to temper financial flows and trade imbalances.
Greece remains the litmus test of the European establishment’s capacity to rationalize the eurozone, and its people have been sacrificed on the altar of an impasse whose repercussions have long since spilled over to the fragmenting political scenery of Central Europe.
Something has to give.
Will it be the establishment’s determination to stick to business as usual?
Or will it be Europe’s integrity?
The Threat of Greek Debt Relief
BERLIN – With Greece’s economic crisis still raging, prominent voices, ranging from Nobel laureate economists like Paul Krugman to officials like US Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew, are calling for more lenient bailout terms and debt relief.
Even the International Monetary Fund – which, along with other European lenders, has provided Greece with emergency financing – recently joined that call.
But could such an approach really be the proverbial silver bullet for Greece’s crisis?
The short answer is no.
While Greece’s public debt is undeniably high, and evidence abounds that high debt can hold back economic growth, the country faces even stronger drags on growth, including structural weaknesses and political brinkmanship, that must be addressed first.
In fact, Greece will likely depend on concessional funding from official sources in the years ahead – funding that is conditional on reforms, not debt ratios.
Greece’s nominal debt stock will matter only once the country re-enters the debt markets and becomes subject to market, not concessional, borrowing terms.
In the meantime, Greece must implement the structural reforms needed to restore the country’s long-term growth prospects and thus to strengthen its capacity to repay its creditors without a large nominal debt reduction.
But there is another critical reason why debt relief is not the answer, and it lies in the political architecture of the European Monetary Union.
Because the eurozone lacks a strong central governing body, crisis policies emerge from a political process in which each of the 19 member states has veto power.
For such a complex system to work, eurozone policymakers must be able to trust one another to behave in a particular way – and that requires a common framework of rules and standards.
A restructuring of Greece’s official debt, despite offering short-term benefits, would weaken that framework in the long run by setting a precedent for exceptions, with other eurozone countries, sooner or later, requesting the same concession.
In 2013, the extension of Greece’s loan maturities prompted Ireland and Portugal to demand – and receive – comparable extensions, despite their less obvious need.
Instead of offering concessions, which could create long-term instability in the eurozone, Europe’s leaders must remain committed to creating strong incentives for all member states to maintain prudent fiscal policies capable of reducing public-debt ratios and restoring fiscal buffers against asymmetric shocks to the currency union.
Only then will the eurozone have a chance of upholding the Lisbon Treaty’s “no bailout” clause.
Greece may account for less than 2% of eurozone GDP, but the pursuit of shortsighted ad hoc solutions to its problems may set precedents that could bring down the entire monetary union.
To prevent such an outcome, it is critical that any solution to the Greek crisis reinforces, rather than undermines, the eurozone’s cohesion.
It is true that Greece has had to undergo painful adjustments to address its deep structural weaknesses, unsustainable public finances, and lack of price competitiveness – adjustments that led to a drop in Greek output.
But high unemployment and a lack of investment cannot be blamed on the medicine prescribed; they are symptoms of the country’s failure to reform its public administration and to enhance the flexibility of its economy.
The international debate about how much austerity is appropriate to balance the interests of Greece and its creditors has distracted policymakers for too long.
It is time to focus on the real imperative: designing and implementing vital structural reforms, at the national and European levels.
To guide this process, the German Council of Economic Experts, which I chair, has developed a set of reforms – called “Maastricht 2.0” – that would reinforce the rules-based framework that is so essential to the eurozone’s long-term success.
For example, the banking union needs to be strengthened through an enhanced resolution regime and an integrated financial supervisor, and a sovereign insolvency mechanism should be introduced.
Underpinning the proposed reforms is the so-called “principle of unity of liability and control,” which demands that both the power to make decisions and liability for their consequences are kept at the same political level, be it national or supranational.
In other words, if countries want to make their own fiscal decisions independent of their eurozone partners, they cannot expect those partners to step in and save them later.
To be sure, in recent years, the European institutional framework has undergone major reforms that reflect the principles of “Maastricht 2.0,” such as the need to emphasize national responsibility for public finances and international competitiveness.
But the reform process remains far from complete.
There is no denying that short-term measures to address acute problems – such as debt relief for Greece – threaten the eurozone’s long-term stability.
If the European Monetary Union is to survive and ultimately thrive, its leaders must not be tempted by facile solutions.
The Lethal Deferral of Greek Debt Restructuring
ATHENS – The point of restructuring debt is to reduce the volume of new loans needed to salvage an insolvent entity.
Creditors offer debt relief to get more value back and to extend as little new finance to the insolvent entity as possible.
Remarkably, Greece’s creditors seem unable to appreciate this sound financial principle.
Where Greek debt is concerned, a clear pattern has emerged over the past five years. It remains unbroken to this day.
In 2010, Europe and the International Monetary Fund extended loans to the insolvent Greek state equal to 44% of the country’s GDP.
The very mention of debt restructuring was considered inadmissible and a cause for ridiculing those of us who dared suggest its inevitability.
In 2012, as the debt-to-GDP ratio skyrocketed, Greece’s private creditors were given a significant 34% haircut.
At the same time, however, new loans worth 63% of GDP were added to Greece’s national debt.
A few months later, in November, the Eurogroup (comprising eurozone members’ finance ministers) indicated that debt relief would be finalized by December 2014, once the 2012 program was “successfully” completed and the Greek government’s budget had attained a primary surplus (which excludes interest payments).
In 2015, however, with the primary surplus achieved, Greece’s creditors refused even to discuss debt relief.
For five months, negotiations remained at an impasse, culminating in the July 5 referendum in Greece, in which voters overwhelmingly rejected further austerity, and the Greek government’s subsequent surrender, formalized in the July 12 Euro Summit agreement.
That agreement, which is now the blueprint for Greece’s relationship with the eurozone, perpetuates the five-year-long pattern of placing debt restructuring at the end of a sorry sequence of fiscal tightening, economic contraction, and program failure.
Indeed, the sequence of the new “bailout” envisaged in the July 12 agreement predictably begins with the adoption – before the end of the month – of harsh tax measures and medium-term fiscal targets equivalent to another bout of stringent austerity.
Then comes a mid-summer negotiation of another large loan, equivalent to 48% of GDP (the debt-to-GDP ratio is already above 180%).
Finally, in November, at the earliest, and after the first review of the new program is completed, “the Eurogroup stands ready to consider, if necessary, possible additional measures… aiming at ensuring that gross financing needs remain at a sustainable level.”
During the negotiations to which I was a party, from January 25 to July 5, I repeatedly suggested to our creditors a series of smart debt swaps.
The aim was to minimize the amount of new funding required from the European Stability Mechanism and the IMF to refinance Greek debt, and to ensure that Greece would become eligible within 2015 for the European Central Bank’s asset-purchase program (quantitative easing), effectively restoring Greece’s access to capital markets.
We estimated that no more than €30 billion ($33 billion, or 17% of GDP) of new, ESM-sourced financing would be required, none of which would be needed for the Greek state’s primary budget.
Our proposals were not rejected.
Although we had it on good authority that they were technically rigorous and legally sound, they simply were never discussed.
The political will of the Eurogroup was to ignore our proposals, let the negotiations fail, impose an indefinite bank holiday, and force the Greek government to acquiesce on everything – including a massive new loan that is almost triple the size we had proposed.
Once again, Greece’s creditors put the cart before the horse, by insisting that the new loan be agreed before any discussion of debt relief.
As a result, the new loan deemed necessary grew inexorably, as in 2010 and 2012.
Unsustainable debt is, sooner or later, written down.
But the precise timing and nature of that write-down makes an enormous difference for a country’s economic prospects.
And Greece is in the throes of a humanitarian crisis today because the inevitable restructuring of its debt has been used as an excuse for postponing that restructuring ad infinitum.
As a high-ranking European Commission official once asked me: “Your debt will be cut come hell or high water, so why are you expending precious political capital to insist that we deliver the restructuring now?”
The answer ought to have been obvious.
An ex ante debt restructuring that reduces the size of any new loans and renders the debt sustainable before any reforms are implemented stands a good chance of crowding in investment, stabilizing incomes, and setting the stage for recovery.
In sharp contrast, a debt write-down like Greece’s in 2012, which resulted from a program’s failure, only contributes to maintaining the downward spiral.
Why do Greece’s creditors refuse to move on debt restructuring before any new loans are negotiated?
And why do they prefer a much larger new loan package than necessary?
The answers to these questions cannot be found by discussing sound finance, public or private, for they reside firmly in the realm of power politics.
Debt is creditor power; and, as Greece has learned the hard way, unsustainable debt turns the creditor into Leviathan.
Life under it is becoming nasty, brutish and, for many of my compatriots, short.
Greece’s Two Currencies
ATHENS – Imagine a depositor in the US state of Arizona being permitted to withdraw only small amounts of cash weekly and facing restrictions on how much money he or she could wire to a bank account in California.
Such capital controls, if they ever came about, would spell the end of the dollar as a single currency, because such constraints are utterly incompatible with a monetary union.
Greece today (and Cyprus before it) offers a case study of how capital controls bifurcate a currency and distort business incentives.
The process is straightforward.
Once euro deposits are imprisoned within a national banking system, the currency essentially splits in two: bank euros (BE) and paper, or free, euros (FE).
Suddenly, an informal exchange rate between the two currencies emerges.
Consider a Greek depositor keen to convert a large sum of BE into FE (say, to pay for medical expenses abroad, or to repay a company debt to a non-Greek entity).
Assuming such depositors find FE holders willing to purchase their BE, a substantial BE-FE exchange rate emerges, varying with the size of the transaction, BE holders’ relative impatience, and the expected duration of capital controls.
On August 18, 2015, a few weeks after pulling the plug from Greece’s banks (thus making capital controls inevitable), the European Central Bank and its Greek branch, the Bank of Greece, actually formalized a dual-currency currency regime.
A government decree stated that “Transfer of the early, partial, or total prepayment of a loan in a credit institution is prohibited, excluding repayment by cash or remittance from abroad.”
The eurozone authorities thus permitted Greek banks to deny their customers the right to repay loans or mortgages in BE, thereby boosting the effective BE-FE exchange rate.
And, by continuing to allow payments of tax arrears to be made in BE, while prescribing FE as a separate, harder currency uniquely able to extinguish commercial bank debt, Europe’s authorities acknowledged that Greece now has two euros.
The real effects of the dual-currency regime on Greece’s economy and society can be gleaned only from the pernicious interaction between the capital controls and the “reforms” (essentially tax hikes, pension reductions, and other contractionary measures) imposed on the country by the eurozone authorities.
Consider the following beguiling example.
Greece’s companies fall roughly into two categories.
In one category are a large number of small firms asphyxiating under the tax office’s demand that they pay in advance, and immediately, 100% of next year’s corporate tax (as estimated by the tax authorities).
The second group comprises listed companies whose depressed turnover jeopardizes their already diminished share value and their standing with banks, suppliers, and potential customers (all of which are reluctant to sign long-term contracts with an underperforming company).
The coexistence, in the same depressed economy, of these two types of businesses gives rise to unexpected opportunities for shadowy trades without which countless businesses might close their doors permanently.
One widespread practice involves two such firms, say, Micro (a small family firm facing a large advance tax payment) and Macro (a publicly traded limited liability company that needs to demonstrate higher turnover than it has).
Macro agrees to issue invoices for (non-existent) goods or services rendered to Micro, up to, say, €20,000 ($22,000).
Micro agrees to pay €24,600 into Macro’s bank account (the price plus 23% value-added tax) on the understanding that Macro will reimburse the €20,000 to Micro.
This way, at a cost of €4,600, Micro reduces its taxable revenue by €24,600, while Macro boosts its turnover figure by €20,000.
Alas, due to capital controls, Macro cannot reimburse Micro in FE, nor can it wire €20,000 to Micro’s BE bank account (lest they be found out by the authorities).
So, to seal the deal, Micro and Macro approach a cash-rich vendor.
This is usually a gas-station owner who is flush with cash at the end of each day and who, for security reasons and in order to pay for his fuel supplies, is obliged to deposit his cash daily at his bank, turning valuable FEs into less valuable BEs.
The mutually beneficial deal is completed when Macro wires €20,000 in BE to the gas-station owner, who then hands over a smaller sum of FE (cash) to Micro’s owner, pocketing the difference.
The fact that this informal deal benefits all sides exposes the terrible inefficiency of current fiscal policy (namely, punitive business taxes) and how capital controls magnify it.
The state collects additional VAT from Micro (at a loss of corporate taxes that Micro cannot pay anyway); Macro enjoys the benefits of seemingly higher turnover; and the gas-station owner reduces his losses from converting FE into BE.
The downside is that economic activity is overstated and, more important, that reform becomes even harder as entrepreneurs internalize the necessity to find new, creative ways of bending the rules.
The sole purpose of the capital controls imposed on Greece last summer was to force the country’s rebellious government to capitulate to the eurozone’s failed policies.
But an unintended consequence was the formalization of two parallel (euro-denominated) currencies.
Combined with the punitive taxation caused by Europe’s refusal to recognize the unsustainability of Greek public debt, the dual-currency regime produces unforeseen incentives for informal transactions in a country that desperately needs to defeat informality.
The reality of Greece’s two currencies is the most vivid demonstration yet of the fragmentation of Europe’s monetary “union.”
In comparison, Arizona has never looked so good.
The Endgame in Greece
PARIS – After months of wrangling, the showdown between Greece and its European creditors has come down to a standoff over pensions and taxes.
Greece is refusing to acquiesce to demands by its creditors that it cut payments to the elderly and raise the value-added tax on their medicine and electricity.
Europe’s demands – ostensibly aimed at ensuring that Greece can service its foreign debt – are petulant, naive, and fundamentally self-destructive.
In rejecting them, the Greeks are not playing games; they are trying to stay alive.
Whatever one might say about Greece’s past economic policies, its uncompetitive economy, its decision to join the eurozone, or the errors that European banks made when they provided its government with excessive credit, the country’s economic plight is stark.
Unemployment stands at 25%.
Youth unemployment is at 50%.
Greece’s GDP, moreover, has shrunk by 25% since the start of the crisis in 2009.
Its government is insolvent.
Many of its citizens are hungry.
Conditions in Greece today are reminiscent of those in Germany in 1933.
Of course, the European Union need not fear the rise of a Greek Hitler, not only because it could easily crush such a regime, but also – and more important – because Greece’s democracy has proved impressively mature throughout the crisis.
But there is something that the EU should fear: destitution within its borders and the pernicious consequences for the continent’s politics and society.
Unfortunately, the continent remains split along tribal lines.
Germans, Finns, Slovaks, and Dutch – among others – have no time for the suffering of Greeks.
Their political leaders tend to their own, not to Europe in any true sense.
Relief for Greece is an especially fraught issue in countries where far-right parties are on the rise or center-right governments face popular left-wing opposition.
To be sure, European politicians are not blind to what is happening in Greece.
Nor have they been completely passive.
At the beginning of the crisis, Greece’s European creditors eschewed debt relief and charged punitive interest rates on bailout funds.
But, as Greeks’ suffering intensified, policymakers pressed private-sector banks and other bondholders to write off most of their claims.
At each stage of the crisis, they have done only what they believed their national politics would bear – no more.
In particular, Europe’s politicians are balking at steps that would implicate taxpayers directly.
The Greek government has asked Europe to swap existing debts with new debts to lock in low interest rates and long maturities.
It has also requested that interest payments be linked to economic growth.
(It has notably not asked for cuts in the face value of its debt).
But debt relief of this sort vis-à-vis European governments or the European Central Bank has been kept off the table.
Such measures would likely require parliamentary votes in countries across the eurozone, where many governments would face intense public opposition – no matter how obvious the need.
Rather than confront the political obstacles, Europe’s leaders are hiding behind a mountain of pious, nonsensical rhetoric.
Some insist that Greece finish its payment program, regardless of the humanitarian and economic consequences – not to mention the failure of all previous Greek governments to meet its terms.
Others pretend to worry about the moral-hazard implications of debt relief, despite the fact that the country’s private-sector debt has already been written off at EU insistence, and that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of precedents for restructuring the debts of insolvent sovereigns.
Almost a century ago, at World War I’s end, John Maynard Keynes offered a warning that holds great relevance today.
Then, as now, creditor countries (mainly the US) were demanding that deeply indebted countries make good on their debts.
Keynes knew that a tragedy was in the making.
“Will the discontented peoples of Europe be willing for a generation to come so to order their lives that an appreciable part of their daily produce may be available to meet a foreign payment?” he asked in The Economic Consequences of the Peace.
“In short, I do not believe that any of these tributes will continue to be paid, at the best, for more than a few years.”
Several European countries now seem content to force Greece into an outright default and provoke its exit from the euro.
They believe that the fallout can be contained without panic or contagion.
That is typical wishful thinking among politicians.
Indeed, it is the type of heedlessness that led US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to let Lehman Brothers fail in September 2008, ostensibly to teach the market a “lesson.”
Some lesson; we are still digging out from Paulson’s monumental mistake.
Similarly, Keynes watched in horror as economic policymakers blundered repeatedly in the years following WWI, through the upheavals of the 1920s, and into the Great Depression of the 1930s.
In 1925, Keynes criticized the insouciance of those “who sit in the top tier of the machine.”
He argued “that they are immensely rash in their regardlessness, in their vague optimism and comfortable belief that nothing really serious ever happens.
Nine times out of ten, nothing really serious does happen – merely a little distress to individuals or to groups.
But we run a risk of the tenth time…”
Today, Greece’s European creditors seem ready to abandon their solemn pledges on the irrevocability of the euro in order to insist on collecting some crumbs from the country’s pensioners.
Should they press their demands, forcing Greece to exit, the world will never again trust the euro’s longevity.
At a minimum, the eurozone’s weaker members will undergo increased market pressures.
In the worst case, they will be hit by a new vicious circle of panic and bank runs, also derailing the incipient European recovery.
With Russia testing Europe’s resolve to the east, the timing of Europe’s gamble could not be worse.
The Greek government is right to have drawn the line.
It has a responsibility to its citizens.
The real choice, after all, lies not with Greece, but with Europe.
A Greek Morality Tale
NEW YORK – When the euro crisis began a half-decade ago, Keynesian economists predicted that the austerity that was being imposed on Greece and the other crisis countries would fail.
It would stifle growth and increase unemployment – and even fail to decrease the debt-to-GDP ratio.
Others – in the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and a few universities – talked of expansionary contractions.
But even the International Monetary Fund argued that contractions, such as cutbacks in government spending, were just that – contractionary.
We hardly needed another test.
Austerity had failed repeatedly, from its early use under US President Herbert Hoover, which turned the stock-market crash into the Great Depression, to the IMF “programs” imposed on East Asia and Latin America in recent decades.
And yet when Greece got into trouble, it was tried again.
Greece largely succeeded in following the dictate set by the “troika” (the European Commission the ECB, and the IMF): it converted a primary budget deficit into a primary surplus.
But the contraction in government spending has been predictably devastating: 25% unemployment, a 22% fall in GDP since 2009, and a 35% increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio.
And now, with the anti-austerity Syriza party’s overwhelming election victory, Greek voters have declared that they have had enough.
So, what is to be done?
First, let us be clear: Greece could be blamed for its troubles if it were the only country where the troika’s medicine failed miserably.
But Spain had a surplus and a low debt ratio before the crisis, and it, too, is in depression.
What is needed is not structural reform within Greece and Spain so much as structural reform of the eurozone’s design and a fundamental rethinking of the policy frameworks that have resulted in the monetary union’s spectacularly bad performance.
Greece has also once again reminded us of how badly the world needs a debt-restructuring framework.
Excessive debt caused not only the 2008 crisis, but also the East Asia crisis in the 1990s and the Latin American crisis in the 1980s.
It continues to cause untold suffering in the US, where millions of homeowners have lost their homes, and is now threatening millions more in Poland and elsewhere who took out loans in Swiss francs.
Given the amount of distress brought about by excessive debt, one might well ask why individuals and countries have repeatedly put themselves into this situation.
After all, such debts are contracts – that is, voluntary agreements – so creditors are just as responsible for them as debtors.
In fact, creditors arguably are more responsible: typically, they are sophisticated financial institutions, whereas borrowers frequently are far less attuned to market vicissitudes and the risks associated with different contractual arrangements.
Indeed, we know that US banks actually preyed on their borrowers, taking advantage of their lack of financial sophistication.
Every (advanced) country has realized that making capitalism work requires giving individuals a fresh start.
The debtors’ prisons of the nineteenth century were a failure – inhumane and not exactly helping to ensure repayment.
What did help was to provide better incentives for good lending, by making creditors more responsible for the consequences of their decisions.
At the international level, we have not yet created an orderly process for giving countries a fresh start.
Since even before the 2008 crisis, the United Nations, with the support of almost all of the developing and emerging countries, has been seeking to create such a framework.
But the US has been adamantly opposed; perhaps it wants to reinstitute debtor prisons for over indebted countries’ officials (if so, space may be opening up at Guantánamo Bay).
The idea of bringing back debtors’ prisons may seem far-fetched, but it resonates with current talk of moral hazard and accountability.
There is a fear that if Greece is allowed to restructure its debt, it will simply get itself into trouble again, as will others.
This is sheer nonsense.
Does anyone in their right mind think that any country would willingly put itself through what Greece has gone through, just to get a free ride from its creditors?
If there is a moral hazard, it is on the part of the lenders – especially in the private sector – who have been bailed out repeatedly.
If Europe has allowed these debts to move from the private sector to the public sector – a well-established pattern over the past half-century – it is Europe, not Greece, that should bear the consequences.
Indeed, Greece’s current plight, including the massive run-up in the debt ratio, is largely the fault of the misguided troika programs foisted on it.
So it is not debt restructuring, but its absence, that is “immoral.”
There is nothing particularly special about the dilemmas that Greece faces today; many countries have been in the same position.
What makes Greece’s problems more difficult to address is the structure of the eurozone: monetary union implies that member states cannot devalue their way out of trouble, yet the modicum of European solidarity that must accompany this loss of policy flexibility simply is not there.
Seventy years ago, at the end of World War II, the Allies recognized that Germany must be given a fresh start.
They understood that Hitler’s rise had much to do with the unemployment (not the inflation) that resulted from imposing more debt on Germany at the end of World War I. The Allies did not take into account the foolishness with which the debts had been accumulated or talk about the costs that Germany had imposed on others.
Instead, they not only forgave the debts; they actually provided aid, and the Allied troops stationed in Germany provided a further fiscal stimulus.
When companies go bankrupt, a debt-equity swap is a fair and efficient solution.
The analogous approach for Greece is to convert its current bonds into GDP-linked bonds.
If Greece does well, its creditors will receive more of their money; if it does not, they will get less.
Both sides would then have a powerful incentive to pursue pro-growth policies.
Seldom do democratic elections give as clear a message as that in Greece.
If Europe says no to Greek voters’ demand for a change of course, it is saying that democracy is of no importance, at least when it comes to economics.
Why not just shut down democracy, as Newfoundland effectively did when it entered into receivership before World War II?
One hopes that those who understand the economics of debt and austerity, and who believe in democracy and humane values, will prevail.
Whether they will remains to be seen.
The Economic Consequences of Greece
TILTON – The first sentence of the 1957 Treaty of Rome – the founding document of what would eventually become the European Union – calls for “an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe."
Recently, however, that ideal has come under threat, undermined by its own political elite, which adopted a common currency while entirely neglecting the underlying fault lines.
Today, those cracks have been exposed – and widened – by the seemingly never-ending Greek crisis.
And nowhere are they more evident than in Greece's relationship with the International Monetary Fund.
When the euro crisis erupted in 2010, European officials realized that they lacked the necessary expertise to manage the threat of sovereign defaults and the potential breakup of the monetary union.
For EU officials, avoiding the eurozone's collapse became the top political imperative, so they turned to the IMF for help.
The irregularities in the Fund's resulting intervention attest to how serious the eurozone's problems were – and continue to be.
For starters, the IMF's Articles of Agreement require it to interact only with entities that are fully accountable for the help received: a member country's “treasury, central bank, stabilization fund, or other similar fiscal agency."
But the institutions with which the IMF is dealing in the eurozone are no longer responsible for their country's macroeconomic management; that power lies with the European Central Bank.
In lending to Greece, it is as if the Fund had lent to a sub-national unit, such as a provincial or city government, without insisting on repayment guarantees from the national authorities.
Another problem is the sheer magnitude of the Fund's intervention.
The size of the Greek debt necessitated lending on a scale far exceeding what other countries could expect.
The “exceptional access" to IMF resources granted to Greece in 2010 was set at a “cumulative limit of 600%" of the country's IMF quota, a measure of a country's financial commitment to the IMF.
Instead, in April 2013, cumulative financing was programmed to peak at 3,212% of Greece's quota.
The reason the IMF had to take on such huge exposure was Europe's initial refusal to contemplate debt reduction for Greece, owing to the authorities' fear that financial contagion would overwhelm the eurozone's firewall-free banking system.
That decision resulted in uncertainty about the currency union's capacity to resolve the crisis and aggravated the contraction in Greek output.
When a debt-restructuring agreement was finally reached in 2012, it provided a window for private creditors to reduce exposure by offloading their residual claims onto taxpayers.
Initially, the IMF took the official position that Greek debt was sustainable.
But IMF staff knew otherwise.
In 2013, the Fund admitted that its analysts knew that Greece's debt was not sustainable, but decided to go ahead with the program “because of the fear that spillovers from Greece would threaten the euro area and the global economy."
In addition, from November 2010 to April 2013, the IMF revised downward its forecast for 2014 Greek nominal GDP by 27%.
This cast doubt on the transparency and accountability of the Fund's debt-sustainability projections.
The implication is shocking: the IMF was unable to provide a credible framework for the adjustment that Greece would have to make.
This background provides crucial context for the ongoing negotiations, for it reveals that the aim of the Greek bailout was not to restore prosperity to the country's people, but to save the eurozone.
Given this, the new Greek government is entirely justified in questioning the terms that the country was given.
The agreements previous administrations made will certainly reduce the range of policies available to the new government, especially with respect to debt reduction, which would require a unilateral default and withdrawal from the eurozone.
But a democratically elected government need not be bound by its predecessors' commitments, and this is doubly true in the wake of an election that was a referendum on those very policies.
Ultimatums from unelected institutions that have compromised their own legitimacy have inflamed anti-EU sentiment across the continent.
The single worst outcome of the current negotiations would be Greece's submission to its creditors' demands, with few concessions in return.
Such a result would fuel greater public support for anti-EU parties and movements elsewhere, and would amount to a missed opportunity for Greece and Europe.
That opportunity is default and exit from the eurozone, which would allow Greece to begin correcting past mistakes and putting its economy on the path to recovery and sustainable growth.
At that point, the EU would be wise to follow suit, by unraveling the currency union and providing debt reduction for its most distressed economies.
Only then can the EU's founding ideals be realized.
Why Greece is Different
BRUSSELS – The seemingly interminable negotiations between the new Greek government and its international creditors – the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission – on a new loan deal have entered a dangerous phase.
At this point, a mistake on either side threatens to trigger the kind of accident that could precipitate a new crisis in Europe.
The IMF seems ready to throw in the towel – not least because of the recent revelation that Greece could post a small primary budget deficit (which excludes interest payments) this year, rather than the planned sizeable surplus.
But, with Greece’s economy tanking again, its government is convinced that the current repayment program is not working – and that, in the absence of significant adjustments, it never will.
Fundamental to Greece’s case for new bailout terms is the narrative – reinforced by its current economic travails – that it has been a victim of excessive austerity.
But this neglects a crucial fact: austerity worked in Europe’s other crisis-hit countries.
Indeed, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and even Cyprus are showing clear signs of recovery, with unemployment finally falling (albeit slowly and from high levels) and access to capital markets restored.
Why is Greece different?
The short answer is exports.
In all of the other crisis-hit countries (and, indeed, in most of the dozens of countries that have received IMF loans in recent decades), rising exports offset, at least partly, the hit that demand took when their governments slashed spending and raised taxes to balance their books.
Of course, in a large economy where external financing is not a problem, as in the United States or the eurozone, attempting to reduce a budget deficit could conceivably lead to such a large decline in demand (and thus tax revenues) that austerity becomes self-defeating.
But this argument does not apply to Greece.
In fact, Greece was running very large current-account deficits – exceeding 10% of GDP – when external financing dried up suddenly in 2008-2009, forcing an adjustment in domestic spending.
If the Greek government had not made such an adjustment, domestic demand and employment would certainly have remained higher – but so would imports and large external deficits.
So, while austerity did cause a deep recession, it enabled Greece to avoid large external deficits, thereby reducing the size of the bailout the country needed.
Export performance is thus the key to escaping the austerity trap.
The problem for Greece is that what little export growth it has experienced lately is largely illusory, as it has come mostly from petroleum products.
Since Greece does not produce oil, this can mean only that Greek refiners, which now have considerable excess capacity, are simply exporting imported crude oil in a slightly different form.
With refinery margins typically less than 5%, the economy is gaining little added value from these exports.
Other exports that have increased, such as metals, raise a similar problem.
Moreover, Greece’s largest services export, maritime shipping, has few real links with the rest of the economy, given that companies in the sector pay no taxes and employ few Greeks (the crews hail from low-wage countries).
Undermining the sector’s economic contribution further is the fact that global commodity prices, on which shipping rates depend, have lately been declining.
Meanwhile, manufactured goods, which do add domestic value and employment, form only a small share of Greece’s overall exports.
In fact, Greece’s total foreign trade, if properly measured, amounts to only 12% of its GDP, much less than what one would expect from such a small economy.
More jarring is the fact that Greece’s total trade deficit (including both goods and services), was even higher in 2008, amounting to 13% of GDP, implying that, in order to avoid a subsequent decline in imports and thus in domestic demand, exports would have had to more than double.
In Portugal, by contrast, the trade deficit amounted to only about one-third of exports in 2008, meaning that exports had to increase by one-third to close the external deficit, without reducing imports.
Since then, Portugal has increased exports cumulatively by more than one-quarter, so that, despite a slight increase in imports since 2007, it runs a trade surplus.
To be sure, Greece’s trade deficit has declined, but only because imports collapsed.
Meanwhile, exports stagnated, even as wages declined by more than 20%.
That, not austerity, is Greece’s real problem.
If Greece had experienced the same growth in exports as Portugal (a country of similar size and per capita income), it would not have experienced such a deep recession, and tax revenues would have been higher, making it much easier for the government to achieve a primary budget surplus.
This suggests that a combination of fiscal consolidation, lower wages, and export-oriented reforms could have enabled Greece to move toward a sustainable recovery.
This approach has been tried before, and it has failed only once, when Argentina had to default on its foreign debt in 2002 and break a decade-long 1:1 peg to the US dollar.
Unfortunately, Greece resembles Argentina in two key respects.
Both countries have only a small export sector, which makes external adjustment much more difficult; and both have an export structure that is skewed toward commodities, the supply of which is unlikely to change much, even as structural reforms are pursued or wages decline.
Of course, this does not mean that Greece is doomed to follow in Argentina’s footsteps toward default.
But it does highlight the challenge that the country faces today – namely, to rebuild its export sector from the ground up.
It is time for Greece’s government to recognize this imperative and expand the scope of negotiations with its creditors to include not just the budget, but also strategies for stimulating exports.
But, first, Greece must finally recognize that austerity is not the enemy.
