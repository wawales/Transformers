At the time, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) – the Fed body that sets monetary policy – issued a median forecast predicting three things.
First, the FOMC indicated that the December 2015 rate increase would be the first of five such increases that it would make within the subsequent year, and the first of nine that would take place by, say, September 2017.
Second, the federal funds rate would reach 2.25-2.5% within three months of the December 2015 increase.
And, third, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflationary pressure – the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index – would be at 1.9% per year by now.
All told, the FOMC’s forecast has not been borne out.
If the Fed actually does increase interest rates this month, it will have undertaken only four of the nine anticipated rate hikes.
Moreover, it believed that nine rate hikes before the end of this summer would be necessary to keep inflation below its target of 2% per year. But inflation is expected to rise at an annual rate of just 1.5% for the rest of this year, and next year.
In terms of inflationary pressure, the Fed’s forecast seems to have significantly overstated the strength of the US economy.
Even with the Fed’s change of course (it is now pursuing a federal funds rate that is 1.5 percentage points below its December 2015 plan), inflationary pressure is still relatively weak.
Indeed, despite the economic boost implied by slower policy tightening, the rate of inflation is still no higher than it was in the 2013-2014 period, when many worried that the Fed wasn’t providing enough stimulus.
We can draw three conclusions about the current situation.
First, today’s weak inflation outlook suggests that the Fed’s monetary policies, in combination with fiscal policies, are not providing sufficient stimulus for the US economy – as was the case in 2013.
Unfortunately, the FOMC does not appear to be particularly concerned about this possibility.
Among FOMC members, Neel Kashkari, the impressive president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, is the only one who has dissented, calling on the Fed to pursue more stimulative policies.
The FOMC’s blind spot stems from the fact that it is relying more on its assessment of the labor market, which it considers to be at or above “full employment,” than on noisy month-to-month inflation data.
But “full employment” is a rather tenuous and unreliable construct.
It has now been 20 years since economists Douglas Staiger, James Stock, and Mark Watson showed that Fed policymakers should not be so confident in estimates of “full employment.”
And yet, for some reason, the Fed community has not let this essential message sink in.
A second conclusion to be drawn from the current situation is that the Fed has now overestimated the strength of the US economy for 11 consecutive years.
Elementary mathematics dictates that credible forecasts should at least overestimate half the time and undershoot half the time.
If each year of Fed forecasting were a coin toss, we would now have had eleven heads in a row, and zero tails. The odds of that happening are one in 2,048.
The Fed clearly needs to take a deep look at its forecasting methodology and policymaking processes.
It should ask if the current system is creating irresistible incentives for Fed technocrats to highball their inflation forecasts. And it should ensure that its policymakers view the 2% target for annual inflation as a goal to aspire to, rather than a ceiling to avoid.
A final conclusion is that the past two years have provided still more data to support former US Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers’ grave suspicion that the economies of the global North are now trapped in a state of “secular stagnation.”
Those who disagree, such as Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University, tell us that all will soon be well, and that nobody will be talking about “secular stagnation” eight years hence.
They may turn out to be right – but only if the Fed can bring itself to pursue stimulus policies that are as radical as they are necessary.
America’s Risky Recovery
CAMBRIDGE – The United States’ economy is approaching full employment and may already be there.
But America’s favorable employment trend is accompanied by a substantial increase in financial-sector risks, owing to the excessively easy monetary policy that was used to achieve the current economic recovery.
The overall unemployment rate is down to just 5.5%, and the unemployment rate among college graduates is just 2.5%.
The increase in inflation that usually occurs when the economy reaches such employment levels has been temporarily postponed by the decline in the price of oil and by the 20% rise in the value of the dollar.
The stronger dollar not only lowers the cost of imports, but also puts downward pressure on the prices of domestic products that compete with imports.
Inflation is likely to begin rising in the year ahead.
The return to full employment reflects the Federal Reserve’s strategy of “unconventional monetary policy” – the combination of massive purchases of long-term assets known as quantitative easing and its promise to keep short-term interest rates close to zero.
The low level of all interest rates that resulted from this policy drove investors to buy equities and to increase the prices of owner-occupied homes.
As a result, the net worth of American households rose by $10 trillion in 2013, leading to increases in consumer spending and business investment.
After a very slow initial recovery, real GDP began growing at annual rates of more than 4% in the second half of 2013.
Consumer spending and business investment continued at that rate in 2014 (except for the first quarter, owing to the weather-related effects of an exceptionally harsh winter).
That strong growth raised employment and brought the economy to full employment.
But the Fed’s unconventional monetary policies have also created dangerous risks to the financial sector and the economy as a whole.
The very low interest rates that now prevail have driven investors to take excessive risks in order to achieve a higher current yield on their portfolios, often to meet return obligations set by pension and insurance contracts.
This reaching for yield has driven up the prices of all long-term bonds to unsustainable levels, narrowed credit spreads on corporate bonds and emerging-market debt, raised the relative prices of commercial real estate, and pushed up the stock market’s price-earnings ratio to more than 25% higher than its historic average.
The low-interest-rate environment has also caused lenders to take extra risks in order to sustain profits.
Banks and other lenders are extending credit to lower-quality borrowers, to borrowers with large quantities of existing debt, and as loans with fewer conditions on borrowers (so-called “covenant-lite loans”).
Moreover, low interest rates have created a new problem: liquidity mismatch.
Favorable borrowing costs have fueled an enormous increase in the issuance of corporate bonds, many of which are held in bond mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
These funds’ investors believe – correctly – that they have complete liquidity.
They can demand cash on a day’s notice.
But, in that case, the mutual funds and ETFs have to sell those corporate bonds.
It is not clear who the buyers will be, especially since the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation restricted what banks can do and increased their capital requirements, which has raised the cost of holding bonds.
Although there is talk about offsetting these risks with macroprudential policies, no such policies exist in the US, except for the increased capital requirements that have been imposed on commercial banks.
There are no policies to reduce risks in shadow banks, insurance companies, or mutual funds.
So that is the situation that the Fed now faces as it considers “normalizing” monetary policy.
Some members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC, the Fed’s policymaking body) therefore fear that raising the short-term federal funds rate will trigger a substantial rise in longer-term rates, creating losses for investors and lenders, with adverse effects on the economy.
Others fear that, even without such financial shocks, the economy’s current strong performance will not continue when interest rates are raised.
And still other FOMC members want to hold down interest rates in order to drive the unemployment rate even lower, despite the prospects of accelerating inflation and further financial-sector risks.
But, in the end, the FOMC members must recognize that they cannot postpone the increase in interest rates indefinitely, and that once they begin to raise the rates, they must get the real (inflation-adjusted) federal funds rate to 2% relatively quickly.
My own best guess is that they will start to raise rates in September, and that the federal funds rate will reach 3% by some point in 2017.
How the Fed Just Reduced Inequality
NEW YORK – The US Federal Reserve has finally done it, raising interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
The ramifications for interest-rate spreads, emerging-market equities, and housing demand, among much else, are the subject of widespread debate.
But, as markets learn to cope with a less accommodative monetary policy, there could be an important silver lining, which most people have ignored.
Income and wealth inequality in the United States has grown steadily since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, but monetary-policy normalization could mark the beginning of the end of this trend.
Indeed, it should serve to accelerate its reversal.
Consider a few dismal statistics reflecting the current state of affairs.
Real (inflation-adjusted) median household income in the US is about the same as in 1979.
A recent study by the Pew Research Center noted that Americans earned 4% less income in 2014 than they did in 2000, and for the first time in more than 40 years, middle-class Americans no longer constitute a majority of the population.
America’s 20 wealthiest people now own more wealth than the bottom half of the entire population The wealth gap between America’s high-income group and everyone else has never been more extreme; rich households account for more than one in five of the entire US population.
Strikingly, one hour north of Wall Street, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the Gini coefficient – a standard measurement of income distribution and inequality – is worse than in Zimbabwe.
Ironically, this trend was exacerbated by the policy response to the financial crisis.
While the recession of 2007-2008 caused higher-income groups to suffer more than lower-income groups (because the former tend to derive relatively more of their income from more volatile sources of capital income, as opposed to labor income), the opposite has been true since 2009.
Since then, about 95% of all income gains have gone to the top 1%.
The causes of rising income and wealth inequality are multiple and nuanced; but the unintended consequences of the recent unprecedented period of ultra-loose monetary policy deserves a chunk of the blame.
Negative real interest rates and quantitative easing have enforced financial repression on holders of cash, hurting savers, while broadly boosting prices of riskier financial assets, most commonly held by the rich.
When there is no yield in fixed income, even the most conservative pension funds pile into risk assets, driving prices higher and higher.
Corporations have benefited massively from these stimulus measures, but at the expense of the working population.
Profit margins have expanded to record highs as companies have cut costs, delayed infrastructure investments, borrowed at ultra-low rates, and taken advantage of weak labor markets to avoid raising wages.
But are we now on the verge of a trend reversal?
The S&P 500 has rallied 150% since its 2009 lows, and valuations look rich given weakening growth dynamics (the Shiller price/earnings ratio stands at 26, compared to 15 in 2009).
Against this backdrop, the wealthiest Americans are unlikely to enjoy substantial further profits from their financial investments in the near term.
At the same time, we should see meaningful upward pressure on wages for the first time in many years.
The unemployment rate has dropped to 5%, just above the Fed’s current median estimate for the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).
While the true NAIRU level is probably lower, and we are likely witnessing a secular decline in the workforce participation rate, the US labor market should still tighten in 2016.
Indeed, the number of those “not in the labor force, currently want a job” category dropped 416,000, to just above 5.6 million, in November; historically, this kind of change has been closely associated with rising wage pressure.
And the average hourly wages for all employees on private non-farm payrolls posted an annual increase of 2.5% in October, the biggest since 2009.
As the Fed slowly raises interest rates, those middle-class families holding their hard-earned savings at the bank will finally start realizing some return on their deposits.
The long-term effects should not be underestimated, given the helpful impact of compound savings.
During the last tightening cycle between 2004 and 2006, households’ interest income rose 29%.
Although this time, the gains presumably will be smaller and slower to arrive, owing to the likely pace and extent of Fed tightening, interest paid on savings will move household income in the right direction: up.
Of course, a multitude of political reforms, each with potential positive implications for welfare, could reduce the extent of inequality further.
But the barriers to such measures – say, to make the tax system more progressive – are well known, especially against the backdrop of a presidential election campaign.
This means that an increase in real wages for workers will have the most immediate impact, even if the downside is lower profit margins for corporate America.
The Fed’s decision to raise rates is a historic moment for financial markets and is already ushering in a period of increased volatility for asset prices worldwide.
Although this may be challenging for investors, we should take comfort in the implications for the real economy.
The social contract in the US has frayed badly, and this is likely to play an important role in the upcoming presidential election, as voters express anger that the American Dream is increasingly out of reach.
No economic recovery can sustain itself without rising wages and higher consumer spending power.
The Fed may have just signaled that the beginning of this necessary dynamic, perhaps the key inflection point of the inequality trend, is finally here.
And it may also have done its part to speed its arrival.
A Cautionary History of US Monetary Tightening
BERKELEY – The US Federal Reserve has embarked on an effort to tighten monetary policy four times in the past four decades.
On every one of these occasions, the effort triggered processes that reduced employment and output far more than the Fed’s staff had anticipated.
As the Fed prepares to tighten monetary policy once again, an examination of this history – and of the current state of the economy – suggests that the United States is about to enter dangerous territory.
Between 1979 and 1982, then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker changed the authorities’ approach to monetary policy.
His expectation was that by controlling the amount of money in circulation, the Fed could bring about larger reductions in inflation with smaller increases in idle capacity and unemployment than what traditional Keynesian models predicted.
Unfortunately for the Fed – and for the American economy – the Keynesian models turned out to be accurate; their forecasts of the costs of disinflation were dead on.
Furthermore, this period of monetary tightening had unexpected consequences; financial institutions like Citicorp found that only regulatory forbearance saved them from having to declare bankruptcy, and much of Latin America was plunged into a depression that lasted more than five years.
Then, between 1988 and 1990, another round of monetary tightening under Alan Greenspan ravaged the balance sheets of the country’s savings and loan associations, which were overleveraged, undercapitalized, and already struggling to survive.
To prevent the subsequent recession from worsening, the federal government was forced to bail out insolvent institutions.
State governments were on the hook, too: Texas spent the equivalent of three months of total state income to rescue its S&Ls and their depositors.
Between 1993 and 1994, Greenspan once again reined in monetary policy, only to be surprised by the impact that small amounts of tightening could have on the prices of long-term assets and companies’ borrowing costs.
Fortunately, he was willing to reverse his decision and cut the tightening cycle short (over the protests of many on the policy-setting Federal Open Markets Committee) – a move that prevented the US economy from slipping back into recession.
The most recent episode – between 2004 and 2007 – was the most devastating of the four.
Neither Greenspan nor his successor, Ben Bernanke, understood how fragile the housing market and the financial system had become after a long period of under-regulation.
These twin mistakes – deregulation, followed by misguided monetary-policy tightening – continue to gnaw at the US economy today.
The tightening cycle upon which the Fed now seems set to embark comes at a delicate time for the economy.
The US unemployment rate may seem to hint at the risk of rising inflation, but the employment-to-population ratio continues to signal an economy in deep distress.
Indeed, wage patterns suggest that this ratio, not the unemployment rate, is the better indicator of slack in the economy – and nobody ten years ago would have interpreted today’s employment-to-population ratio as a justification for monetary tightening.
Indeed, not even the Fed seems convinced that the economy faces imminent danger of overheating.
Inflation in the US is not just lower than the Fed’s long-term target; it is expected to stay that way for at least the next three years.
And the Fed’s change in policy comes at a time when its own economists believe that US fiscal policy is inappropriately restrictive.
Meanwhile, given the fragility – and interconnectedness – of the global economy, tightening monetary policy in the US could have negative impacts abroad (with consequent blowback at home), especially given the instability in China and economic malaise in Europe.
It is tempting to conclude that the Fed’s eagerness to tighten monetary policy – despite unfavorable historical precedents and ongoing economic uncertainty – is driven by commercial banks with excessive influence in official policymaking.
After all, commercial banks’ business model works only when the banks can earn (via passive and relatively safe long-term investments) at least 3% a year more than they pay depositors.
And that is possible only if US Treasury rates are higher than they are now.
If this is true, it would reflect a failure by bankers to understand their industry’s material interests.
What would most benefit commercial banks is not an immediate increase in interest rates, but a monetary policy that contributes to ensuring that the economy is capable of supporting higher interest rates in the future.
If history is any guide, tightening monetary policy in the near term will only lead to further economic turbulence, followed by a rapid retreat to low interest rates.
Embarking on that path should be a cause of concern for everyone.
The Fed’s Risk to Emerging Economies
MILAN – The US Federal Reserve has finally, after almost a decade of steadfast adherence to very low interest rates, hiked its federal funds rate – the rate from which all other interest rates in the economy take their cue – by 25 basis points.
That brings the new rate up to a still-minimal 0.5%, and Fed Chair Janet Yellen has wisely promised that any future increases will be gradual.
Given the state of the US economy – real growth of 2%, a tightening labor market, and little evidence of inflation rising toward the Fed’s 2% target – I view the rate rise as a reasonable and cautious first step toward normality (defined as a better balance between borrowers and lenders).
However, other central banks, particularly in economies where the output gap is larger than in the United States, will not be keen to follow the Fed’s lead.
That implies a coming period of monetary-policy divergence, with uncertain consequences for the global economy.
On the face of it, a tiny change in the US rate should not trigger dramatic shifts in global capital flows.
But, as US monetary policy follows the path of interest-rate normalization, there could well be knock-on effects, both economic and financial, especially in the form of currency volatility and destabilizing outflows from emerging economies.
The reason we should fear this possibility is that the world’s economic equilibrium is both fragile and unstable – and could wobble dangerously without determined and coordinated policy intervention.
A Fed rate hike might not tip it over, but some other seemingly innocuous event could.
One doesn’t need a long memory to understand how even relatively modest policy shifts can trigger outsize market reactions.
Consider, for example, the “taper tantrum” that roiled financial markets in the spring of 2013, after then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke said only that policymakers were thinking of gradually ending quantitative easing.
But that announcement came as a surprise (as did the devaluation of China’s renminbi this past summer).
Capital that had flooded into emerging markets seeking yields no longer available in developed economies abruptly reversed course.
No investor wanted to be the last one out.
A jittery global financial system, like the one we have now, does not tolerate unwelcome surprises well.
Unlike the taper tantrum and the devaluation of the renminbi, the Fed’s rate-hike announcement on December 16 certainly was no surprise.
So one might argue that if the Fed’s move does lead to volatility in international capital flows, the process must have already started.
In fact, near-universal anticipation of a US rate rise did not produce a spike in capital flows or asset prices.
Yet widespread concerns persist.
The International Monetary Fund for example, has argued that any rate hike by the Fed would need an “effective monetary policy communication strategy” – a polite way of saying that any monetary tightening in the US and other advanced economies would be premature.
The reasoning is that emerging economies have become dangerously dependent on low interest rates and high commodity prices.
Many emerging-market companies are in the highly vulnerable position of having borrowed heavily in foreign currencies.
If capital flight occurs, the consequences will be dire: tightened credit, balance-of-payments difficulties, inflation, rising interest rates, fiscal stress, and downgrades by the major credit-rating agencies – all of which implies more capital flight.
Europeans, too, have become dependent on low interest rates, with the European Central Bank as the key stabilizing force.
Without the ECB’s commitment, in place since 2012, to prevent sovereign-debt yields from soaring, there would be a persistent risk to the eurozone – and, indeed, to the entire edifice of the European Union – of sovereign-debt defaults.
But at least Europe has benefited from falling commodity prices.
By contrast, many emerging economies, highly dependent on commodity export earnings, have been stressed by the commodity-price reset, sluggish growth in developed economies, and slower growth in China.
Capital flight would materially add to their plight – in some cases disastrously so.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the world has become accustomed to such linkages and spillovers.
And yet policy responses to crises remain decentralized.
There is no ECB for the emerging economies.
They cannot be confident of appropriate reactions by their policymakers to rapid capital outflows, or of their capacity in terms of policy tools, reserves, and balance sheets.
And they cannot be fully certain of the speed and effectiveness of the international policy responses that might otherwise act as “circuit breakers.”
The reality is that emerging markets that benefited after the 2008 crisis from China’s economic growth, rising commodity prices, and cheap foreign capital must now adjust to reversals in all of these factors.
The necessary transitions for these markets will be complex, risky, and not entirely within their control.
While the Fed’s rate hike, prudently accompanied by an emphasis on small and gradual steps, may not turn out to be a trigger, the concerns about the knock-on effects are legitimate.
It would be unwise to assume that, with the initial hike now behind us, systemic risk has somehow disappeared.
In the long run, of course, emerging markets will benefit from interest-rate normalization, because they will no longer suffer the distortions and imbalances that lead to unsustainable growth patterns.
But the hard part will be getting from here to there without an accident.
Felipe Calderón’s Two Faces
MEXICO CITY – Mexican President Felipe Calderón has finally gotten what he wanted: the resignation of United States Ambassador Carlos Pascual.
Calderón shot the messenger for delivering bad news through confidential cables released by WikiLeaks.
Pascual’s harsh assessments of the “war on drugs” that Calderón unleashed four years ago infuriated the president.
The revelations also annoyed the Mexican army, for they pointed out that the military frequently doesn’t act on intelligence provided by the US, and displays a strong aversion to risk.
Moreover, Pascual’s candid assessments described a dysfunctional situation in which Mexican security agencies fight each other more than they fight organized crime.
Essentially, Pascual was forced to leave for describing a reality that Calderón does not want to face, and that his government would prefer to ignore.
In other words, he lost his job for doing it properly.
But the stubborn truth revealed by the US diplomat emerges every day, despite the impact of drug kingpins who are arrested, the number of weapons discovered, or the amount of cocaine seized.
Mexico is not winning the “war” against drug trafficking and organized crime: Pascual’s forced resignation cannot hide the 34,000 dead, the growing number of Mexicans addicted to drugs, the surge in kidnappings and executions, and widespread impunity.
The official narrative is that violence is an inevitable consequence of taking on the drug cartels.
But other countries have managed to prevent drug gangs from unleashing their fury on innocent civilians.
And, while Mexicans are told that the violence is only between rival gangs, executions transcend the realm of drug trafficking.
Citizens are exhorted by their government to denounce criminals, though 98.5% of criminal investigations are never solved.
A recent poll showed that 59% of Mexicans believe that the government is losing the war that it declared, while only 23% support the government’s current course.
As Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War, all wars entail deception.
Mexico has become its latest victim.
The Mexican government has not been sufficiently honest about the scale of the challenges that it faces, the measures that it has taken, and the level of US support, involvement, and collaboration that it has sought.
Therein lie the contradictions, evasiveness, and lack of transparency regarding the terms on which Calderón’s war is being conducted.
Everyone on his team demands that the US devote more attention and resources to Calderón’s effort, but publicly denies doing so when evidence of heightened US presence in Mexico becomes public.
In recent weeks, the Calderón administration has twisted itself into knots trying to explain how and why it authorized US drone planes to fly over Mexican territory for intelligence-gathering purposes.
And yet, while Calderón insists that the US assume its bilateral responsibilities, he also demands the US Ambassador’s head for revealing his own tactical and strategic mistakes in the war he insists on prosecuting.
Calderón’s contradictory stance is rooted in the reflexive habits of a Mexican political class trained to gain points by kicking the US.
Calderón, too, has sought refuge behind the folds of the Mexican flag and in diatribes about sovereignty under siege.
In other words, Calderón accuses the US of intervention, even as he assiduously seeks it.
He criticizes the US for meddling, after his government promoted that meddling.
Pascual is accused of behaving like a “Proconsul,” after Mexican authorities – due to incompetence or irresponsibility – assigned him that role.
In a recent interview, Calderón lambasted Pascual for his “ignorance,” after the ambassador sent incontrovertible cables describing the real situation on the ground.
They’re painful to read, but difficult to refute.
Rather than shooting the messenger, Calderón should reflect on the message itself, and rethink not only the war but the terms on which he has decided to wage it.
The cables should lead Calderón to rectify a strategy that so far has increased the level of violence without decreasing drug trafficking.
The “success” of the war needs to be measured by the reduction in its toll of violence.
Moreover, Pascual’s conclusions should force Calderón to redefine Mexico’s relationship with the US in a more honest fashion.
Because if all of this does not happen, Calderón’s ability to force out the US ambassador, and any short-term political gain he obtained in doing so, will be irrelevant.
Indeed, after the “ugly American” has packed his bags, Ciudad Juárez will still be the most dangerous city in the world.
The homicide rate in the country will continue to soar, and public security agencies will remain incapable of preventing, detecting, or punishing the vast majority of violent events that have placed the country on edge.
The Mexican government will continue to request US aid in a surreptitious fashion, and deny doing so when it becomes public.
The message is clear.
If we Mexicans don’t end this war – so ill-conceived, so poorly executed, and so badly explained – it will end us.
One does not have to read Carlos Pascual’s leaked cables to understand that.
Feminism and the Male Brain
NEW YORK – North Americans of my generation grew up with the 1970’s children’s record “Free to Be...You and Me,” on which Rosey Grier, an immense former football star, sang “It’s Alright to Cry.”
The message: girls could be tough, and boys were allowed not to be.
For almost 40 years, that era’s Western feminist critique of rigid sex-role stereotyping has prevailed.
In many ways, it has eroded or even eliminated the kind of arbitrary constraints that turned peaceable boys into aggressive men and stuck ambitious girls in low-paying jobs.
Feminists understandably have often shied away from scientific evidence that challenges this critique of sex roles.
After all, because biology-based arguments about gender difference have historically been used to justify women’s subjugation, women have been reluctant to concede any innate difference, lest it be used against them.
But, in view of recent scientific discoveries, has feminist resistance to accepting any signs of innate gender difference only created new biases?
The feminist critique, for example, has totally remade elementary-level education, where female decision-makers prevail: the construction of male hierarchies in the schoolyard is often redirected nowadays for fear of “bullying,” with boys and girls alike expected to “share” and “process” their emotions.
But many educators have begun to argue that such intervention in what may be a hardwired aspect of “boy-ness” can lead to boys’ academic underperformance relative to girls, and to more frequent diagnoses of behavioral problems, attention deficit disorder, and so on.
And education is just the beginning.
An entire academic discipline emerged out of the wholesale critique of the male tendency to create hierarchy, engage in territoriality, and be drawn to conflict.
When I was in college, the feminist solution to “patriarchy” was an imagined world without hierarchy, where people verbalized all day long and created emotional bonds.
This critique of “masculinity” also dramatically affected intimate relationships: women were encouraged to express their dissatisfaction with men’s refusal to “share” their inner lives.
Women complained of not being heard, of men disappearing after work to tinker in the garage or zone out in front of the TV.
But, however heartfelt, such complaints assumed that men choose all of their behavior.
Now a spate of scientific analyses, based on brain imaging technology and new anthropological and evolutionary discoveries, suggests that we may have had our heads in the sand, and that we must be willing to grapple with what seem to be at least some genuine, measurable differences between the sexes.
The most famous of these studies, anthropologist Helen Fisher’s The Anatomy of Love , explains the evolutionary impetus for human tendencies in courtship, marriage, adultery, divorce, and childrearing.
Some of her findings are provocative: it seems, for example, that we are hard-wired for serial monogamy and must work very hard to maintain pair-bonds; that highly orgasmic women enjoy an evolutionary advantage; and that flirtation among primates closely resembles the way young men and women in a bar show their sexual interest today.
Moreover, in her description of our evolution, Fisher notes that males who could tolerate long periods of silence (waiting for animals while in hunt mode) survived to pass on their genes, thus genetically selecting to prefer “space.”
By contrast, females survived best by bonding with others and building community, since such groups were needed to gather roots, nuts, and berries, while caring for small children.
Reading Fisher, one is more inclined to leave boys alone to challenge one another and test their environment, and to accept that, as she puts it, nature designed men and women to collaborate for survival.
“Collaboration” implies free will and choice; even primate males do not succeed by dominating or controlling females.
In her analysis, it serves everyone for men and women to share their sometimes different but often complementary strengths – a conclusion that seems reassuring, not oppressive.
What Could He Be Thinking? , by Michael Gurian, a consultant in the field of neurobiology, takes this set of insights further.
Gurian argues that men’s brains can actually feel invaded and overwhelmed by too much verbal processing of emotion, so that men’s need to zone out or do something mechanical rather than emote is often not a rejection of their spouses, but a neural need.
Gurian even posits that the male brain actually can’t “see” dust or laundry piling up as the female brain often can, which explains why men and women tend to perform household tasks in different ways.
Men often can’t hear women’s lower tones, and their brains, unlike women’s, have a “rest” state (he actually is sometimes thinking about “nothing”!).
Moreover, Gurian argues that men tend to rear children differently from women for similarly neurological reasons, encouraging more risk-taking and independence and with less awareness of the details of their nurture.
One can see the advantages to children of having both parenting styles.
He urges women to try side-by-side activities, not only face-to-face verbalization, to experience closeness with their mates.
Somehow, all this is liberating rather than infuriating.
So much that enrages women, or leads them to feel rejected or unheard, may not reflect men’s conscious neglect or even sexism, but simply their brains’ wiring!
According to Gurian, if women accept these biological differences and work around them in relationships, men respond with great appreciation and devotion (often expressed nonverbally).
Women who have embraced these findings report that relations with the men in their lives become much smoother and, paradoxically, more intimate.
None of this means that men and women should not try to adjust to each other's wishes, ask for shared responsibility with housework, or expect to be “heard.”
But it may mean we can understand each other a bit better and be more patient as we seek communication.
Nor does recent scientific research imply that men (or women) are superior, much less justify invidious discrimination.
But it does suggest that a more pluralistic society, open to all kinds of difference, can learn, work, and love better.
Fictional Sovereignties
LONDON – A year ago, tiny Georgia tried to regain control over its breakaway enclave of South Ossetia.
The Russians quickly expelled the Georgian army, to almost universal opprobrium from the West.
South Ossetia, together with Abkhazia (combined population 300,000), promptly declared their “independence,” creating two new fictional sovereignties, and acquiring in the process all the official trappings of statehood: national heroes, colorful uniforms, anthems, flags, frontier posts, military forces, presidents, parliaments, and, most important, new opportunities for smuggling and corruption.
So far, only Russia and Nicaragua recognize the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
Russian recognition was widely seen as retaliation for Western recognition of Kosovo (population two million), the breakaway province of Serbia, earlier last year.
A thousand miles to the west of Georgia is Moldova (population 3.5 million), which lies between Romania and Ukraine.
Annexed by Tsarist Russia in 1812, joined to Romania in 1918, and re-annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, it seized its independence from Moscow in 1991.
It is a member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and various other prestigious international bodies.
Moldova’s main claim to fame is King Stephen the Great, who defeated the Ottomans in a great fifteenth century battle.
It also produces rather good wine.
An enduring memory from my own recent visit to its capital Chisinau is the election poster of a local politician called Lupu, who holds a pair of spectacles to his eyes, whether to suggest visions or wisdom isn’t clear.
To get to Moldova from Odessa (now in Ukraine) one must drive through the self-proclaimed “republic” of Transdniestria (population 700,000), a sliver of land on the north shore of the Dniester river.
A clump of peeling buildings, rusting wire, and a filthy lavatory mark the start of Transdniestrian sovereignty.
Progress through this squalid, but well manned, frontier post involved the stamping of lots of documents and a liberal scattering of bribes, a process repeated on leaving the “republic.”
A shadowy mafia-style company, Sheriff, owns most of the economy.
It is said to have close links to the president and his family.
It has built a giant football stadium in the capital, Tiraspol, which seems to be some kind of symbol of Transdniestrian virility.
Unrecognized by the rest of the world, Transdniestrian “independence” is secured by a Russian garrison.
The world’s population is about six billion.
Suppose it was divided into independent political units of two million people each. That would mean 3,000 micro-states, each refusing to accept any sovereignty superior to its own.
Of course, this would be a recipe for global anarchy.
Yet the trend over the past century has been towards a continuous increase in the number of small states, mainly owing to nationalist revolts against multi-national empires: the latest bout of state creation followed the disintegration of the USSR.
Even long-established states like the United Kingdom now have strong separatist movements.
In its political life, the world has been regressing to a form of tribalism, even as its economic life has become increasingly globalized.
The equation of state with nation is the arch-heresy of our time.
A “nation” is, at root, an ethno-linguistic – occasionally religious – entity, and because it is through language and liturgy that culture is transmitted, each nation will have its own distinctive cultural history, available for use and misuse, invention and discovery.
The state, however, is a political construction, designed to keep the peace in an economically viable territory.
There are simply too many “nations,” actual or potential, to form the basis of a world system of states, not least because so many of them, having been jumbled up for centuries, cannot now be disentangled.
Micro-states can never be made small enough to satisfy their advocates’ exalted standards of cultural integrity.
So the unraveling of multi-national states is a false path.
The way forward lies in democratic forms of federalism, which can preserve sufficient central authority for the purposes of statehood, while respecting local and regional cultures.
Today’s upsurge of micro-nationalism is not just a consequence of the revolt against empires: it is also a revolt against globalization.
There is widespread resistance to the idea that the chief function of modern states is to slot their peoples into a global market dominated by the imperatives of efficiency and cheapness, heedless of the damage to non-economic activities.
This feeling is strengthened when the global economy turns out to be a global casino.
National assertion is a way of combating impersonal forces and remote authorities.
Globalization promises too much in terms of welfare gains, particularly to developing countries, to be abandoned.
But the lesson from the current crisis is that we will have to develop styles of global economic governance to manage, regulate, and mitigate the creative, but often disruptive forces unleashed by the global market.
In the absence of an actual world government, this can be done only through cooperation among states.
The fewer “sovereigns” there are, the easier it will be to secure the necessary cooperation.
The Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944, which laid the institutional foundation for the post-war World War II economy, was made possible because the United States and Britain called the shots.
When objections were raised to Cuba being put on the drafting committee, Harry Dexter White, the American representative, remarked that Cuba’s function was to provide cigars.
Such a cavalier attitude to the demands of lesser powers to be heard is no longer possible.
But all this means is that the facades will have to be more subtle and the fictions more elaborate.
Provided we do not deceive ourselves about where real power lies, let presidents and parliaments be three a penny if that is what makes people feel good about themselves.
Fiddling at the Fire
PARIS – Financial markets have rallied since July on the hope that the global economic and geopolitical outlook will not worsen, or, if it does, that central banks stand ready to backstop economies and markets with additional rounds of liquidity provision and quantitative easing.
So, not only has good – or better-than-expected – economic news boosted the markets, but even bad news has been good news, because it increases the probability that central-banking firefighters like US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will douse the markets with buckets of cash.
But markets that rise on both good and bad news are not stable markets.
“Risk-off” episodes, in which investor sentiment sours, are likely to return if economic news worsens and confidence in policymakers’ effectiveness drops.
In the eurozone, euphoria followed the ECB’s decision to provide support with potentially unlimited purchases of distressed countries’ bonds.
But the move is not a game changer; it only buys time for policymakers to implement the tough measures needed to resolve the crisis.
And the policy challenges are daunting: the eurozone’s recession is deepening as front-loaded fiscal consolidation and severe credit rationing continues.
And, as eurozone banks and public-debt markets become increasingly balkanized, establishing a banking union, a fiscal union, and an economic union while pursuing macroeconomic policies that restore growth, external balance, and competitiveness will be extremely difficult.
Even the ECB’s support is not obvious.
Monetary hawks – the Bundesbank and several other core central banks – who were worried about a new open-ended ECB mandate pushed successfully for strict and effective conditionality for countries benefiting from the bond purchases.
As a result, they can pull the plug on the program if its stringent criteria are not met.
Moreover, Greece could exit the eurozone in 2013, before Spain and Italy are successfully ring-fenced; Spain – like Greece – is spiraling into depression, and may need a full-scale bailout by the “troika” (the ECB, the European Commission, and the International Monetary Fund).
Meanwhile, austerity fatigue in the eurozone periphery is increasingly clashing with bailout fatigue in the core.
Small wonder, then, that Germany, politically unable to vote on more bailout resources, has outsourced that job to the ECB, the only institution that can bypass democratically elected parliaments.
But, again, liquidity provision alone – without policies to restore growth soon – would merely delay, not prevent, the breakup of the monetary union, ultimately taking down the economic/trade union and leading to the destruction of the single market.
In the United States, the latest economic data – including a weak labor market – confirm that growth is anemic, with output in the second half of 2012 unlikely to be significantly stronger than the 1.6% annual gain recorded in January-June.
And, given America’s political polarization and policy gridlock, we can expect more fights on the budget and the debt ceiling, another rating downgrade, and no agreement on a path toward medium-term fiscal consolidation and sustainability – regardless of whether President Barack Obama is reelected in November.
On the contrary, we should expect agreement only on the path of least political resistance: avoidance of tough fiscal choices until the bond vigilantes eventually wake up, spike long rates, and force fiscal adjustment on the political system.
In China, a hard economic landing looks increasingly likely as the investment bubble deflates and net exports shrink.
Meanwhile, the reforms necessary to reduce savings and increase private consumption are being delayed.
As in Europe and the US, the worst will be avoided in 2012 only by kicking the can down the road with more monetary, fiscal, and credit stimulus.
But a hard landing becomes more likely in 2013, as the stimulus fades, non-performing loans rise, the investment bust accelerates, and the problem of rolling over the debts of provincial governments and their special investment vehicles can no longer be papered over.
And, given a new leadership’s caution as it establishes its power, reforms will occur at a snail’s pace, making social and political unrest more likely.
Meanwhile, Brazil, India, Russia, and other emerging economies are playing the same game.
Many have not adjusted as advanced economies’ weakness reduces the room for export-led growth; and many delayed structural reforms needed to boost private-sector development and productivity growth, while embracing a model of state capitalism that will soon reveal its limits.
So the recent slowdown of growth in emerging markets is not just cyclical, owing to weak growth or outright recession in advanced economies; it is also structural.
Similar dithering is apparent at the geopolitical level as well.
The major global powers are still trying negotiations and sanctions to induce Iran to abandon its efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
But Iran is playing for time and hoping to reach a zone of immunity.
By 2013, an Israel that – rightly or wrongly – perceives Iran’s nuclear program to be an existential threat, and/or the US, which has rejected containment of a nuclear Iran, may decide to strike, leading to a war and a massive spike in oil prices.
Ineffective governments with weak leadership are at the root of the problem.
In democracies, repeated elections lead to short-term policy choices.
In autocracies like China and Russia, leaders resist the radical reforms that would reduce the power of entrenched lobbies and interests, thereby fueling social unrest as resentment against corruption and rent-seeking boils over into protest.
But, as everyone kicks the can down the road, the can is getting heavier and, in the major emerging markets and advanced economies alike, is approaching a brick wall.
Policymakers can either crash into that wall, or they can show the leadership and vision needed to dismantle it safely.
The FIFA Syndrome
LONDON – The arrest of FIFA executives on a raft of fraud and corruption charges has been front-page news in recent days.
But the charges brought by the Swiss and American authorities focus on bribery and embezzlement, and do not address another egregious injustice: the treatment of the migrant workers in Qatar who are building the stadiums for the 2022 FIFA Football World Cup.
Amnesty International recently released a report on the abysmal conditions in Qatar.
The workers are subject to unsafe construction sites, exploitative recruitment agencies, and little recourse to formal justice.
Recently, Nepal’s labor minister publicly spoke out about the government of Qatar not allowing his country’s migrant workers to return home to mourn relatives who died in the April 2015 earthquake.
As Amnesty International notes, the responsibility lies primarily with the Qatari authorities.
But FIFA had – and still has – a responsibility to act.
There have also been calls for sponsors, including McDonalds, Visa, Coca-Cola, Adidas, Budweiser, Gazprom, KIA, and Hyundai, to place pressure on FIFA and Qatar to improve working conditions.
Such issues have arisen in recent years in other sectors as well.
In April, Human Rights Watch issued a report on the treatment of garment workers in Bangladesh.
The report, prompted by the 2013 Rana Plaza collapse, in which more than 1,100 people died and over 2,000 were injured, highlighted poor working conditions, inadequate building inspections, weak labor laws, and the need for fairer wage practices and legal benefits.
Beyond these examples, there have been many others.
In technology, Apple and Foxconn have faced criticism for working conditions at their Chinese production sites.
Even educational institutions, such as New York University’s new campus in Abu Dhabi, have been tainted by episodes of workplace exploitation and abuse.
These are not isolated cases.
For every disaster and high-profile case that hits the headlines, there are many more that we never hear about.
Nonetheless, one hopes that the treatment of those who make the goods, produce the services, and build the things that make us happy and productive – from clothing and technology to sports stadiums and college campuses – continues to come under scrutiny.
Globalization should force managers – and all of us – to do some serious thinking about labor practices around the world.
Here is where it gets complicated.
What counts as a company’s workforce?
Are “its” workers only those people on its own payroll?
Are companies responsible for their products’ entire supply chains?
To what extent can – and should – a company be held to account for the choices of those who may be several links removed?
When a serious issue has been brought to a company’s attention, are its managers obliged to address it, even if it involves the subcontractor of a subcontractor?
The larger and more complex the company, the harder it is to track all of the firms with which it does business, the firms that they then subcontract to, and so on.
Companies, not surprisingly, say that their responsibility extends only so far.
But that is not an answer; it is a choice.
Organizations can decide to extend their reach.
They can even decide that they want to know the full provenance of all materials and components in their products, and that they will hold their extended suppliers to account.
In this sense, the larger the company, the greater its responsibility.
But larger companies also have a larger ability to become a force for good, both locally and globally.
If a company the size of US retailer Walmart decides that it will not allow wasteful packaging, its purchasing power will lead to changes in packaging for the entire retail sector.
The same is true of wages and labor practices.
When the world’s biggest companies and most well recognized brands take seriously their responsibility as buyers, sellers, and manufacturers and make a firm commitment to act on core values, others tend to follow – or risk being left behind.
Those that operate in an ethical manner and seek to improve the lives of all who are associated with the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of their products will benefit from kudos, more business, or simply not being singled out as a bad actor.
By contrast, companies whose managers believe that a competitive marketplace is no place for ethical behavior will suffer if and when consumers take their business elsewhere; government regulation and fines force them to act; or they become unable to attract an educated and ever-more discerning workforce.
All of it – the constant scrutiny, the bad press, the tarnished reputation – will hit their long-term stock prices.
Much the same is true for organizations like FIFA.
When sponsors like Coca-Cola or Adidas believe that their reputations will be tarnished by association with an organization engaged in corrupt practices, they will take their brand-management dollars elsewhere.
Companies are made up of people.
Paying fair wages, adopting ethical sourcing practices, and upholding the dignity of workers should be a part of the way they calculate their success.
Those who disconnect themselves from the fate of others, who act without conscience or a sense of right and wrong, and who spurn ordinary human decency have no place running organizations or sitting on company boards.
The things that make us happy must not come at an unforgivably high price.
The Soccer Mafia
NEW YORK – The only surprise about the arrest of seven FIFA officials in a Swiss hotel in the early morning of May 27 is that it happened at all.
Most people assumed that these pampered men in expensive suits, governing the world’s soccer federation, were beyond the reach of the law.
Whatever rumors flew or reports were made on bribes, kickbacks, vote-rigging, and other dodgy practices, FIFA President Joseph “Sepp” Blatter and his colleagues and associates always seemed to emerge without a scratch.
So far, 14 men, including nine current or former FIFA executives (but not Blatter), have been charged with a range of fraud and corruption offenses in the United States, where prosecutors accuse them, among other things, of pocketing $150 million in bribes and kickbacks.
And Swiss federal prosecutors are looking into shady deals behind the decisions to award the World Cup competitions in 2018 and 2022 to Russia and Qatar, respectively.
There is, of course, a long tradition of racketeering in professional sports.
American mobsters have had a major interest in boxing, for example.
Even the once gentlemanly game of cricket has been tainted by the infiltration of gambling networks and other crooked dealers.
FIFA is just the richest, most powerful, most global milk cow of all.
Some have likened FIFA to the Mafia, and Blatter, born in a small Swiss village, has been called “Don Blatterone.”
This is not entirely fair.
So far as we know, no murder contracts have ever been issued from FIFA’s head office in Zürich.
But the organization’s secrecy, its intimidation of the rivals to those who run it, and its reliance on favors, bribes, and called debts do show disturbing parallels to the world of organized crime.
One could, of course, choose to see FIFA as a dysfunctional organization, rather than a criminal enterprise.
But even in this more charitable scenario, much of the malfeasance is a direct result of the federation’s total lack of transparency.
The entire operation is run by a close-knit group of men (women play no part in this murky business), all of whom are beholden to the boss.
This did not start under Blatter.
It was his predecessor, the sinister Brazilian João Havelange, who turned FIFA into a corrupt and vastly rich empire by incorporating more and more developing countries, whose votes for the bosses were bought with all manner of lucrative marketing and media deals.
Huge amounts of corporate money from Coca-Cola and Adidas went sloshing through the system, all the way to the roomy pockets of Third World potentates and, allegedly, of Havelange himself.
Coke was the main sponsor of the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, ruled in those days by a brutal military junta.
Blatter is not quite as uncouth as Havelange.
Unlike the Brazilian, he does not openly associate with mobsters.
But his power, too, relies on the votes of countries outside Western Europe, and their loyalty, too, is secured by the promise of TV rights and commercial franchises.
In the case of Qatar, this meant the right to stage the World Cup in an utterly unsuitable climate, in stadiums hastily built under terrible conditions by underpaid foreign workers with few rights.
Complaints from slightly more fastidious Europeans are often met with accusations of neo-colonialist attitudes or even racism.
Indeed, this is what makes Blatter a typical man of our times.
He is a ruthless operator who presents himself as the champion of the developing world, protecting the interests of Africans, Asians, Arabs, and South Americans against the arrogant West.
Things have changed since the days when venal men from poor countries were paid off to further Western political or commercial interests.
This still occurs, of course.
But the really big money now, more often than not, is made outside the West, in China, the Persian Gulf, and even Russia.
Western businessmen, architects, artists, university presidents, and museum directors – or anyone who needs large amounts of cash to fund their expensive projects – now have to deal with non-Western autocrats.
So do democratically elected politicians, of course.
And some – think of Tony Blair – turn it into a post-government career.
Pandering to authoritarian regimes and opaque business interests is not a wholesome enterprise.
The contemporary alliance of Western interests – in the arts and higher education no less than in sports – with rich, undemocratic powers involves compromises that might easily damage established reputations.
One way to deflect the attention is to borrow the old anti-imperialist rhetoric of the left.
Dealing with despots and shady tycoons is no longer venal, but noble.
Selling the franchise of a university or a museum to a Gulf state, building yet another enormous stadium in China, or making a fortune out of soccer favors to Russia or Qatar is progressive, anti-racist, and a triumph of global fraternity and universal values.
This is the most irritating aspect of Blatter’s FIFA.
The corruption, the vote-buying, the absurd thirst of soccer bosses for international prestige, the puffed-out chests festooned with medals and decorations – all of that is par for the course.
It is the hypocrisy that rankles.
To lament the shift in global power and influence away from the heartlands of Europe and the US is useless.
And we cannot accurately predict this shift’s political consequences.
But if the sorry story of FIFA is any indication, we can be sure that, whatever forms government might take, money still rules.
Back to Disease-Fighting Basics
LONDON – Combating antimicrobial resistance will require groundbreaking technological solutions.
To prevent superbugs from claiming an estimated ten million lives a year by 2050, we will need to invent new types of antimicrobial drugs and develop rapid diagnostic tests to avoid unnecessary treatment and cut our massive overuse of antibiotics.
And yet, as important as these high-tech contributions may be, they are only partial fixes.
To tackle the problem permanently, the only option is to prevent infections from occurring in the first place – with improved hygiene, sanitation, and disease surveillance.
Indeed, only by focusing on these areas will we lower the demand for new drugs over the long term.
Indeed, in the nineteenth century, long before modern drugs were available, major Western cities tackled diseases by seeking to prevent infections.
And this approach remains the best solution for large cities with growing populations.
Consider London in the 1850s: Living conditions for the poor were grim.
Male life expectancy was 40 years.
Diseases like cholera and tuberculosis were rife, and there was no way to treat them.
In September 1854, a cholera outbreak devastated the city’s impoverished, central Soho district, killing 500 people in just ten days.
Enter John Snow, a pioneering physician who had intuited that cholera was spread not through the air, as conventional wisdom held, but through water.
Snow monitored the progress of the Soho outbreak in unprecedented detail, mapping each case.
His research convinced him that the source of the outbreak was a shared water pump in the heart of the district.
And once the pump’s handle was removed, the pace of the outbreak slowed dramatically.
Several of Snow’s methods are directly applicable to the modern problem of antimicrobial resistance.
For starters, his effort demonstrated the efficacy of using data to understand a public health crisis.
His mapping and statistical analysis helped identify the epicenter of the outbreak and thus its root cause.
Snow’s emphasis on using data to guide his intervention is a principle that institutions like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation insist upon today.
The recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa demonstrated, in tragic fashion, the importance of good data.
The epidemic spread most dramatically in areas where basic infrastructure and surveillance systems had broken down.
As a result, even after Ebola had been declared a public health emergency and funding had been made available, it remained difficult for many weeks to direct resources where they were most needed.
Worryingly, as the latest paper from my Review on Antimicrobial Resistance warns, there is no globally coordinated system of surveillance to monitor the emergence and spread of superbugs around the world.
Fundamental gaps remain in how data are gathered and shared, even in the world’s richest countries.
The result is a series of enormous blind spots that deprive us of the key insights and early warnings that we need to mount an effective response.
Snow’s other major contribution was to identify the central role that water plays in spreading diseases like cholera, leading authorities in Europe to invest in the development of sewage and sanitation systems.
Decades before the discovery of cures like penicillin, there was no alternative but to invest in prevention to beat infectious diseases and protect growing urban populations.
This infrastructure-building was spectacularly successful: The last urban cholera outbreak in Western Europe occurred in 1892, and by the time World War I broke out, communicable diseases had ceased to be the leading cause of death across much of the continent.
As antimicrobial drugs became more widely available, however, the focus moved away from preventive measures.
This has not only had dire implications for urban dwellers forced to live in unsanitary conditions; it has also contributed to rising drug resistance.
Today, inadequate access to safe water and sanitation is one of the leading causes of diarrheal illness – a major killer and the reason that hundreds of millions of people take antibiotic treatments each year.
Most of this consumption is unnecessary, however, as the cause of diarrhea is usually viral; taking antibiotics in these cases only contributes to the development of resistant bacteria.
Estimates provided to my team suggest that in India, Nigeria, Brazil, and Indonesia alone, nearly a half-billion cases of diarrhea are treated each year with antibiotics.
Were these four countries to provide their citizens with universal access to clean water and sanitation, this consumption could be reduced by at least 60%.
Such infrastructure is costly, and all countries face tough budgetary choices.
But it is one of the best value-for-money investments a middle-income country can make.
When one controls for income, increasing a population’s access to sanitation by 50% is correlated with more than nine years of additional life expectancy.
John Snow would have been pleased.
One of his most significant contributions to the field of health care – the judicious use of data – is confirming the importance of another: investment in hygiene and sanitation.
Sometimes those who study history are blessed to repeat it.
Fighting Biopiracy
OTTAWA– In April 1999 Larry Proctor, a United States citizen and owner of a seed company, won a patent at the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), claiming a Mexican yellow bean.
The patent conferred Proctor exclusive rights over a bean variety he called “Enola.”
That decision is one of the most outrageous examples of biopiracy in the history of intellectual property systems.
The bean for which Proctor was granted a patent is a farmers’ variety, originally from Mexico and in the public domain for centuries.
The bean is consumed throughout Mexico and by Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the US who know it by the names Mayocoba, Canario, or Peruano.
Although the bean variety existed in publicly available seed collections, it took ten years, hundreds of thousands of dollars, massive protest by farmers and civil society, the intervention of international agencies, and five consecutive legal decisions before the USPTO finally annulled the patent in July 2009.
By then, Proctor had exercised a complete monopoly over the production, distribution, and marketing of the bean for more than half of the patent’s lifespan.
The story began in 1994, when Proctor purchased a bag of beans in Mexico.
He planted the beans, selected seeds from the same plants, and planted them again, repeating the procedure two more times.
In late 1996, after barely two years, he stated that he had invented a “unique” variety, and applied for a patent.
As soon as Proctor was awarded the patent, he sued two importers of the yellow beans, demanding that they pay royalties.
Although the importers knew that Proctor’s invention was ludicrous (because they had been importing the bean from Mexico for years), they had no choice but to accept the patent’s legality, causing 22,000 Mexican farmers and their families to lose 90% of their export incomes in just the first year.
In January 2000, the Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration (ETC Group, then known as RAFI) published the first denunciation of the Enola patent as technically invalid and morally unacceptable.
To obtain a patent, an applicant must demonstrate that an invention meets three criteria: newness, non-obviousness (that there is an inventive step), and utility (the invention does what it claims to do).
In the case of the Enola bean, there was nothing at all new: the yellow bean is the result of centuries of collective work and ingenuity on the part of Mexican farmers and indigenous peoples.
Moreover, the bean was incorporated into public collections held by INIFAP, the Mexican national agricultural research institute.
ETC Group took the case to the Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) in Cali, Colombia.
CIAT is one of the international centers of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
The CGIAR system maintains more than 600,000 samples of crop varieties in gene banks, mostly collected from peasant fields.
Acknowledging this, CGIAR signed a Trust Agreement with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 1994, pledging to keep the seeds in their collections free of any intellectual property claims.
Joachim Voss, then CIAT’s director, confirmed that the yellow beans were present in CIAT’s gene bank, and that they had originated in Mexico.
At the end of 2000, CIAT, supported by the FAO, requested that the USPTO re-examine the patent.
Geneticists then performed genetic fingerprinting on the yellow beans, and concluded that Proctor’s Enola bean was identical to the Mexican beans covered by the Trust Agreement.
Meanwhile, in 2001, taking advantage of the USPTO’s slow response, Proctor sued 16 small seed companies in Colorado for patent-infringement.
Only in December 2003 did the USPTO announce its first “non-final” rejection of the patent.
Proctor appealed, and the USPTO issues its final rejection of the patent in April 2005.
But that was not the end of the Enola bean issue.
Proctor requested that the patent examination be continued, submitting additional patent claims and even changing his lawyers several times (allowing more bureaucratic delay).
In total, the patent was rejected and appealed four times within a decade, until the US Court of Appeals rejected it for the fifth time this summer.
For more than a decade, a single patent owner disrupted the bean market in the US and Mexico.
Importers stopped importing not only the yellow bean, but also other Mexican beans, fearing lawsuits.
Although the patent was eventually rescinded, the Enola case shows how the intellectual property system facilitates the monopolization of public and collective resources, favoring those who can pay expensive lawyers’ fees.
The Enola patent was wrong from the outset, yet it remained enforceable for half its life, despite the active efforts of international institutions, governments, and civil-society organizations.
It may be tempting to dismiss the Enola patent as an aberration, but there are hundreds of examples of such biopiracy.
Mexican beans, South Asian basmati rice, Bolivian quinoa, Amazonian ayahuasca, Indian chickpeas, Peruvian nuña beans, Andean maca – all have been subject to predatory intellectual property claims.
The Enola controversy is a stark illustration of the danger of patenting life, and the power of patents to block agricultural imports, disrupt or destroy developing countries’ export markets, hijack staple food crops that are the cultural heritage of millennia, plunder collective knowledge, and threaten food security.
The Enola case demonstrates that being right is not enough: small farmers, indigenous people, and the poor can’t out-last a decade of lawsuits and monopoly.
Undoubtedly, international institutions and countries in the global South have far more urgent goals than to spend resources suing greedy companies.
It is high time to question the very existence of an intellectual property system that privileges monopoly ownership over the common good.
Cancer’s Dangerous Mythology
GENEVA – This year, World Cancer Day will focus on dispelling damaging myths about the disease.
The theme – illustrated in the tagline “Cancer – Did you know?” – offers an opportunity to reflect on cancer’s true consequences and enhance global prevention and treatment efforts.
One prevailing myth is that cancer is primarily a developed-country problem.
But, while it is true that cancer is pervasive in wealthy countries, people in the world’s poorest countries lose more years of life to the disease.
As medical advances and technological developments have helped cancer patients in high-income countries to live longer – to the extent that some forms of cancer have effectively become chronic conditions – those in low-income countries continue to die young.
Besides being unjust, this is deeply tragic.
Having eluded killers like malaria and AIDS, one should not then be killed prematurely by cancer – especially a form of cancer that could have been prevented with something as simple and as affordable as a vaccine.
The often-overlooked link between vaccines and cancer highlights a second common misconception: fate alone (and perhaps smoking) determines who gets cancer.
In fact, one in six cancer cases worldwide is caused by a known infectious agent, with the proportion rising to one-third in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The four main culprits are hepatitis B and C (hepB and hepC), human papillomavirus (HPV), and Helicobacter pylori, which are collectively responsible for 1.9 million cases of liver, cervical, and gastric cancer annually.
Cervical cancer now kills more women than childbirth, claiming a life every two minutes.
Of the 275,000 women who die of cervical cancer annually, 85% live in the world’s poorest countries.
After all, cervical cancer tends to target the most vulnerable in particular, such as women infected with HIV.
If left unchecked, the number of cervical cancer deaths is set to rise to 430,000 annually by 2030.
Then there is hepB, which is over 50 times more infectious than HIV and often passed from mother to child before or shortly after birth, increasing the likelihood of liver cancer later in life.
An estimated two billion people alive today have been infected with hepB, while 350 million people are chronically infected.
Of these, roughly one-quarter will die from hepB-related liver cancer or cirrhosis (a consequence of chronic liver disease).
The good news is that powerful tools are available to avert many of these deaths.
Existing HPV vaccines can prevent up to 70% of cervical cancer cases, and new vaccines are in the pipeline that will improve this record further.
Likewise, hepB vaccines are 95% effective at preventing infection and its chronic consequences.
Vaccines protecting against Helicobacter pylori and hepC are in development (although the latter is proving particularly challenging).
Even an Epstein-Barr virus vaccine, which would protect against some kinds of lymphoma, is achieving promising results.
But paying for and delivering these vaccines to the most vulnerable citizens of low-income countries poses a significant challenge.
Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended including the hepB vaccine in routine immunization since 1992, its high price initially hindered its uptake in some developing countries.
More recently, the same problem threatened to hinder the adoption of HPV vaccines.
But the GAVI Alliance intervened to ensure that this is no longer a concern with hepB, and it is unlikely to occur with HPV.
Since its launch in 2000, the GAVI Alliance has sought to increase access to life-saving vaccines for the world’s poorest children.
In partnership with the World Bank, the WHO, UNICEF, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, it has used innovative financing tools to raise funds for global immunization programs, while working with industry to lower the prices of vaccines.
By including the hepB vaccine as part of a pentavalent (five in one) vaccine, the Alliance has already facilitated its delivery to children in 70 countries as part of routine immunizations.
The Alliance is now working to make the HPV vaccine available to more than 30 million of the world’s poorest women and girls by 2020; as part of this effort, and coinciding with World Cancer Day, it has launched demonstration programs in eight developing countries.
A growing body of evidence shows that vaccines’ benefits extend beyond preventing illness and death.
They have also been found to aid infants’ cognitive development and children’s educational attainment, thus boosting countries’ economic-growth potential.
In the fight against cancer, medical advances can shave precious percentage points off of mortality rates, which implies that improved access to vaccines can have a massive impact, slashing the number of future cases in developing countries for just a few dollars per dose.
People in rich countries are undoubtedly familiar with the maxim that prevention is better than cure.
But, given the ready availability of vaccines in developed countries, the focus of prevention efforts has shifted to changing cancer-causing lifestyles.
Meanwhile, people in developing countries lack access to simple and effective tools for preventing several of the most common cancers.
Improving access to vaccines is crucial to addressing this global inequity and reducing the widening gap between rich and poor.
This requires, first and foremost, dispelling the myth that one cannot “catch” cancer.
Climate Change on the Menu
VITERBO, ITALY – When we think about winning the fight against climate change, most people concentrate on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions from cars, trucks, and other machines powered by fossil fuels.
But while these emissions sources are certainly worthy of our attention, another culprit receives far less than it deserves: our food.
Farm and food sustainability are important pieces of the climate-change puzzle, but at the moment, climate-sustainable diets are not on the menu.
In the developing world, some 821 million people currently suffer from hunger.
Meanwhile, rich countries waste enough food every year to feed 750 million people.
Here is where the connection between food and climate change comes in: as people climb out of poverty – as many are – they demand more meat and dairy.
This trend has grave implications for agriculture’s ecological footprint.
Animals consume more food than they produce.
Cows release large volumes of heat-trapping methane.
And clearing land for pasture releases carbon dioxide at a staggering rate.
If the beef and dairy industries were a country, it would be the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind only the United States and China.
Fortunately, there is a solution: eat less meat and more fruit and vegetables.
Reducing red meat consumption to twice per week would reduce global farmland by three-quarters – an area equivalent in size to the US, China, the European Union, and Australia combined.
Doing so would also make nutritional sense.
At the moment, livestock farming uses about 80% of the planet’s farmland but produces just 18% of our calories.
Worst of all, animal farming is a threat to our water supply; according to the Stockholm International Water Institute, the world could run out of fresh water by 2050 unless people reduce their consumption of animal products to just 5% of their daily calorie requirements.
Something must change, and fast; celebrities certainly understand this.
Climate guru and former US Vice President Al Gore, who comes from a family of cattle ranchers, is now vegan, as is his former boss, US President Bill Clinton.
Tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams, pop singer Beyoncé, and many others are also reducing their meat consumption.
Meanwhile, schools all over the world are adopting “Meat Free Mondays” to teach students about sustainability.
Even McDonald’s has begun offering McVegan burgers in Scandinavia, apparently to rave reviews.
A recent study published by the Economist Intelligence Unit and the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition Foundation (BCFN) found that official policies toward sustainable food and food waste are also changing.
In 2016, for example, France became the first country in the world to prohibit grocery stores from wasting food.
Italy has adopted a similar law.
Apartment dwellers in Denmark, where Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen has put food waste on the political agenda, throw out 25% less food than they did five years ago.
The SU-Eatable Life project, a three-year European Commission initiative that I am leading in partnership with BCFN – aims to demonstrate that dietary changes can have a significant ecological effect.
Data show that by eating less meat and wasting less food, European consumers could reduce water consumption by two million cubic meters and lower CO2 emissions by about 5,300 tons every year.
So, what can each of us do to support these efforts?
For starters, we should consume more vegetables and grains, which would be good for the planet’s health and our own.
A 2017 French study found that vegetarians are often healthier than meat eaters because they eat a more varied diet and consume fewer calories.
We should eat according to the BCFN’s Double Food and Environmental Pyramid, which recommends foods that are high in nutritional value and less damaging to the environment; plant-based proteins are the best.
In fact, in a world dominated by vegans, agricultural greenhouse-gas emissions would be 70% lower than they are today.
That would be a welcome mouthful indeed.
Fighting Corruption Won’t End Poverty
CAMBRIDGE – Countries are poor because governments are corrupt.
And, unless they ensure that public resources are not stolen, and that public power is not used for private gain, they will remain poor, right?
It certainly is tempting to believe so.
Here, after all, is a narrative that neatly aligns the promise of prosperity with the struggle against injustice.
As Pope Francis said on his recent trip to Latin America: “corruption is the moth, the gangrene of a people.”
The corrupt deserve to be “tied to a rock and cast into the sea.”
Perhaps they do.
But that won’t necessarily make their countries more prosperous.
Consider the data.
Probably the best measure of corruption is the World Bank’s Control of Corruption Indicator, which has been published since 1996 for over 180 countries.
The CCI shows that while rich countries tend to be less corrupt than poor ones, countries that are relatively less corrupt, for their level of development, such as Ghana, Costa Rica, or Denmark, do not grow any faster than others.
Nor do countries that improve in their CCI score, such as Zambia, Macedonia, Uruguay, or New Zealand, grow faster.
By contrast, the World Bank’s Government Effectiveness Indicator suggests that countries that, given their income level, have relatively effective governments or improve their performance, do tend to grow faster.
For some reason – probably related to the nature of what NYU’s Jonathan Haidt calls our “righteous minds” – our moral sentiments are strongly related to feelings of empathy in the face of harm and unfairness.
It is easier to mobilize against injustice than for justice.
We are more enthusiastic to fight the bad – say, hunger and poverty – than to fight for, say, the kind of growth and development that makes food and sustainable livelihoods plentiful.
Sometimes switching from the “bad” to the corresponding “good” is simply a matter of semantics: to fight against racism is to fight for nondiscrimination.
But, in the case of corruption, which is a bad that is caused by the absence of a good, attacking the bad is very different from creating the good.
The good is a capable state: a bureaucracy that can protect the country and its people, keep the peace, enforce rules and contracts, provide infrastructure and social services, regulate economic activity, credibly enter into inter-temporal obligations, and tax society to pay for it all.
It is the absence of a capable state that causes corruption (the inability to prevent public officials, often in collusion with other members of society, from subverting decision-making for private gain), as well as poverty and backwardness.
Some might argue that reducing corruption entails the creation of a capable state; the good is created out of the fight against the bad.
But is it?
Teachers and nurses often do not show up for work, but that does not mean that performance would improve much if they did.
Policemen may stop asking for bribes, but that will not make them any better at catching criminals and preventing crime.
Curtailing side-payments does not imply the ability to manage concession contracts or collect taxes.
Aside from prosecuting some bad apples, measures to fight corruption typically involve reforming procurement rules, public financial-management systems, and anti-corruption legislation.
The underlying assumption is that the new rules, unlike the previous rules, will be enforced.
That has not been Uganda’s experience.
In 2009, under pressure from the aid community, the government enacted what was billed at the time as the best anti-corruption legislation in the world; and yet all corruption indicators have continued to worsen.
Uganda is not an exception.
My colleague at Harvard, Matt Andrews, has documented the failure of public financial management reforms designed to prevent graft.
And the reasons for these failures are not specific to financial management.
All organizations need to be perceived as legitimate.
They can create this perception by actually performing the function for which they were created, which is difficult.
Alternatively, they can borrow from the natural world a strategy called isomorphic mimicry: just as non-poisonous snakes evolve to resemble a poisonous species, organizations can make themselves look like institutions in other places that are perceived as legitimate.
And this is what the anti-corruption agenda often ends up stimulating: the creation of organizations that are more obsessed with abiding by the new and burdensome processes than they are with achieving their stated goals.
As Harvard’s Lant Pritchett, Michael Woolcock, and Andrews argue, when inept organizations adopt “best practices” such as financial management systems and procurement rules, they become too distracted by decision-distorting protocols to do what they were established to do.
As Francis Fukuyama has pointed out, the development of a capable state that is accountable and ruled by law is one of the crowning achievements of human civilization.
It involves the creation of a shared sense of “us,” an imagined community on whose behalf the state acts.
This is not an easy task when societies are deeply divided by ethnicity, religion, or social status.
After all, who is the state for?
All Iraqis or just the Shia among them?
All Kenyans or just the Kikuyu?
What is to prevent the ethnic group currently in power from diverting resources to itself on the argument that “it’s our turn to eat?”
Why shouldn’t those currently in control of the state transform it into their patrimony, as in Venezuela, where, more than two years after former President Hugo Chávez’s death, his daughters still occupy the presidential residence?
The fight against corruption mobilizes all of us because we want to do away with evil and injustice.
But we should remember that casting the bad into the sea does not imply the sudden appearance on our shores of the good that we need.
When Fighting Fake News Aids Censorship
WASHINGTON, DC – Many media analysts have rightly identified the dangers posed by “fake news,” but often overlook what the phenomenon means for journalists themselves.
Not only has the term become a shorthand way to malign an entire industry; autocrats are invoking it as an excuse to jail reporters and justify censorship, often on trumped-up charges of supporting terrorism.
Around the world, the number of honest journalists jailed for publishing fake or fictitious news is at an all-time high of at least 21.
As non-democratic leaders increasingly use the “fake news” backlash to clamp down on independent media, that number is likely to climb.
The United States, once a world leader in defending free speech, has retreated from this role.
President Donald Trump’s Twitter tirades about “fake news” have given autocratic regimes an example by which to justify their own media crackdowns.
In December, China’s state-run People’s Daily newspaper posted tweets and a Facebook post welcoming Trump’s fake news mantra, noting that it “speaks to a larger truth about Western media.”
This followed the Egyptian government’s praise for the Trump administration in February 2017, when the country’s foreign ministry criticized Western journalists for their coverage of global terrorism.
And in January 2017, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan praised Trump for berating a CNN reporter during a live news conference.
Erdoğan, who criticized the network for its coverage of pro-democracy protests in Turkey in 2013, said that Trump had put the journalist “in his place.”
Trump returned the compliment when he met Erdoğan a few months later.
Praising his counterpart for being an ally in the fight against terrorism, Trump made no mention of Erdoğan’s own dismal record on press freedom.
It is no accident that these three countries have been quickest to embrace Trump’s “fake news” trope.
China, Egypt, and Turkey jailed more than half of the world’s journalists in 2017, continuing a trend from the previous year.
The international community’s silence in the face of these governments’ attacks on independent media seems to have been interpreted as consent.
In Turkey, the world’s top jailer of journalists two years in a row, the erosion of free speech has been particularly swift.
Since a failed coup attempt in 2016, Turkey’s courts have processed some 46,000 cases involving people accused of insulting the president, the nation, or its institutions.
Each of the 73 journalists currently behind bars is being investigated for, or charged with, anti-state crimes.
The most common charge against reporters is belonging to, aiding, or propagandizing for an alleged terrorist organization.
Vaguely worded laws that conflate reporting about terrorism with supporting it provide cover for regimes intent on preventing unfavorable news coverage.
For example, attempting to write about the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Turkey, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, or Uighurs in China can quickly land reporters in jail for harboring terrorist sympathies.
Nearly three-quarters of the 262 journalists in prison around the world are being held on anti-state charges, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists’ most recent survey.
Even when journalists aren’t arrested, autocrats are increasingly invoking the claim of “fake news” to discredit legitimate reporting.
And here, ironically, efforts by some Western governments to sanitize social media of fake or violent material have played into the autocrats’ hands.
While the goals of these cleansing efforts – to prevent the type of electoral interference that Russia has perfected, for example – are laudable, an unintended consequence has been censorship of honest journalists reporting on real stories in some of the world’s most dangerous places.
Consider what happened last year to video coverage of the civil war in Syria.
In an effort to rein in extremist content, YouTube removed hundreds of videos related to the conflict, including many posted by Shaam News Network, Qasioun News Agency, and Idlib Media Center – all independent news outlets documenting the disaster.
Similarly, Facebook closed accounts of individuals and organizations that were using the platform to document violence against Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar, a crisis that the United Nations has called a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing.”
Facebook said it acted in response to violations of the platform’s “community standards.”
And in Egypt and Syria, Twitter has blocked citizen journalists from reporting on human-rights abuses, according to journalists whose accounts have been closed.
Twitter’s censors have even hit the heart of Europe; in January, a German satire magazine was blocked from the platform after the Bundestag enacted legislation imposing fines of up to €50 million ($61 million) on social media firms that fail to remove illegal content in a timely manner.
Other European countries are considering similar measures to compel Internet companies to battle misinformation and extremism.
Laws meant to curb hate speech, violence, or “fake news” may be well intentioned, but their implementation has been sloppy, with few mechanisms to ensure accountability, transparency, or reversibility.
Governments are outsourcing censorship to the private sector, where maximizing shareholder value, not upholding journalistic freedom, drives decision-making.
Leaders of the world’s democracies must resist the illiberal assault on independent news organizations, and that means rethinking loosely crafted content laws that are vulnerable to abuse.
A free, vibrant media is vital to the functioning of a healthy society, and misinformation can undermine it.
But official remedies that end up silencing those reporting the news are worse than the disease.
Fighting Poverty in America
BERKELEY – From 2005 to 2014, the real income of two-thirds of households in 25 developed economies was flat or fell.
Only after very aggressive government intervention in taxes and transfers have some countries been able to hold families at least even.
This experience holds lessons for countries like the United States, where inequality and income distribution loom large in the run-up to November’s presidential and congressional elections.
What can the US learn from what works?
The US is a global outlier in tying much of its social safety net to employment.
Social-welfare spending averages 23% of GDP in Europe, but only 16% in the US.
And the US is an especially distant outlier when it comes to families: only three other countries – Tonga, Suriname, and Papua New Guinea – lack a national policy on paid family leave.
There are, however, many successful policy initiatives in the US.
For example, Pete Weber, a retired business executive from Fresno and a member of the California Republican Party’s executive committee, is at the forefront of a nationwide movement of efforts to think boldly about how to move families out of poverty and into self-sufficiency.
The Fresno Bridge Academy, founded by Weber in 2010, has received statewide and national acclaim for its results – not only its success with individuals in need, but also its cost effectiveness.
The program is an 18-month employment-training program that also provides support services for families – including computer-literacy classes, résumé assistance, parenting classes, and tutoring for children – through its non-profit umbrella agency, Reading and Beyond.
Located in the poorest postal code in California, the program has helped 1,200 families who enrolled voluntarily and is funded to serve an additional 2,300 families over the next two years.
To date, 80% of enrolled families have gained employment or significant wage growth, and 80% of those that do, retain these gains a year later.
Thirty percent have achieved full self-reliance within just 18 months.
The Fresno scheme, funded by an innovation grant from the SNAP (formerly food stamps) program, is rigorously outcome-based and quantitatively assessed.
It has generated $22 of benefit for every dollar invested, with $16 going to the families and $5 going to taxpayers (mainly in the form of higher revenues and reduced outlays for food stamps).
While the circumstances in Fresno are particular to the agricultural economy there, Weber believes the program is scalable and is already extending it to two other California counties (San Joaquin and Napa).
Through a broader effort with California Forward’s Economic Summit, Weber is embedding the lessons from Fresno in an effort to move a million families out of poverty in the state by 2025.
New approaches such as that taken by the Fresno Bridge Academy come at a time when both the left and the right are questioning current anti-poverty programs.
By some estimates, since President Lyndon B. Johnson launched his “War on Poverty” in 1964, total spending on the fight has exceeded $22 trillion.
Yet the front isn’t moving. The official poverty rate in the US seems stuck at roughly 15%.
On the right, Speaker of the US House of Representatives Paul Ryan’s Expanding Opportunity in America anchors the view that America already spends enough and just needs to spend it better.
Ryan’s plan focuses on integrating programs into an “opportunity grant,” expanding the earned income tax credit (EITC), and criminal justice reform – all while encouraging economic growth, so that job creation does the heavy lifting.
On the left, organizations like the Opportunity Institute (full disclosure: we both sit on its board of directors) argue for targeted spending, particularly in early education; linking college to careers; and reducing criminal recidivism.
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s policy platform proposes new programs to address these issues, with a particular focus on family leave and early childhood and college education.
Many if not most scholars who have explored the topic, such as a joint effort by the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute, include elements from the left and the right – particularly strategies aimed at strengthening families, improving the quality and quantity of work available, and breaking the cycle of recidivism.
The EITC also has broad backing (more than three-quarters of economists surveyed by the American Economic Association support expanding it).
There is also broad consensus on the need for better quantitative assessment of what works.
Others, especially many in Silicon Valley’s technology world and some in the labor movement, are concerned that technology will outpace job creation and leave many out of work.
They would prefer a universal basic income (UBI), which would sever the link between employment and income.
Swiss citizens roundly rejected that approach in a recent referendum, but the energy devoted to more radical approaches to help those who need it is welcome, even if the specifics of UBI and its cost have yet to proven.
Examples like the Bridge Academy – and others, such as the Federal Home Visiting Program– show that initiatives that are deeply rooted in and tailored to the needs of the communities they serve, and that are driven by evidence of effective outcomes, can work.
Unfortunately, we too often embrace the opposite approach: broad-brush national programs with no focus on outcomes.
Consider the US Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service.
Approximately 88% of its $82 billion in annual spending goes to direct aid (SNAP, or “food stamps”) while only 0.33% goes to providing people the skills they need to avoid government assistance.
Even worse, none of the skills-focused programs have data to evaluate them.
A “progressive federalist” program would substantially increase this type of spending and rigorously evaluate it.
Such a program would set high federal standards but allow cities and states to innovate, then fund what works.
It’s time to think differently and align our thinking – and our spending – with what actually works.
Fighting Terrorism Democratically
Bombings in London and Turkey have brought to the fore the old ideas that authoritarian regimes are better equipped than democracies to combat terrorism, and that such attacks are the price we pay for liberty.
For some, that is a price worth paying; for others, the costs seem too high.
But a look at the record shows that democracies possess more effective weapons to fight terror than do authoritarian regimes.
Indeed, it is when democracies abandon their ethics and fail to resist the authoritarian temptation that they become weaker.
Of course, the logic behind calls to restrict our freedoms has a simplistic appeal: extremists use our freedoms to commit their crimes, so preventing the abuse of freedom requires curtailing freedom’s scope.
The mistake, however, is to assume that open societies are more permissive and vulnerable to terrorism than those who live under authoritarian regimes.
One need only look at today’s Russia, or recall Algeria in the 1990’s.
True, democracy and the rule of law provide no foolproof security guarantee.
But such a guarantee is a mirage anyway, whereas respect for basic freedoms and due process when repressing terrorism is a powerful instrument to isolate extremists and diminish their legitimacy in the eyes of those that might identify with their cause.
It is because Britain is a democracy that respects the rule of law that it has been able to mobilize vast sectors of its Muslim community.
By contrast, authoritarian regimes’ repression of civilians, and their non-differentiation between civilians and killers, provides extremists with fertile recruiting conditions by discrediting the government in the eyes of a significant part of its population.
An undifferentiated approach towards political Islamism that fails to distinguish between those who reject violence and those who resort to terror only facilitates the extremists’ work, for they emerge as champions of causes that do not reflect their true goals.
Russia provides conclusive evidence of the impotence of authoritarian violence and disregard for the rule of law.
President Vladimir Putin undertook a scorched-earth policy in Chechnya, driving many Chechen nationalists straight into the extremists’ arms.
Terrorist attacks on Russia did not cease or decline.
Indeed, recall the terrorism in Beslan in September 2004, in which a single attack on a school killed over 330 people.
Iraq also is demonstrating the limits of illegitimate violence when combating terrorism.
The Bush administration now seems to realize this.
It would be a mistake to believe that the deaths of thousands of civilians, along with arbitrary imprisonment and torture, do not contribute to the spread of terror in Iraq.
After all, torture victims are the best possible advertisement for terrorist recruitment.
When it comes to fighting terrorism, moreover, democracies are more effective both politically and operationally, particularly in terms of their intelligence services.
Intelligence forces in authoritarian states are either highly centralized or tend to become autonomous power centers.
In either case, they are subject to no public scrutiny and accountability.
As a result, they lose their ability over time to evaluate critically their own actions and errors.
Intelligence services in democratic contexts usually have oversight mechanisms that serve to limit abuses of power, and to guarantee effective action by punishing top officials that fail to do their jobs properly.
In the United States, a powerful bi-partisan Senate committee directly monitors the intelligence services.
Its report on the inability of the intelligence services, notably the CIA and the FBI, to prevent the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks also contained a series of recommendations for restructuring these services to render them more effective.
Europe’s response to terror requires, first and foremost, strengthening its intelligence services so that they can detect and dismantle terrorist cells while respecting basic rights and due process.
It also requires greater coordination among all the European Union’s member states and their allies and partners.
At the same time, the rule-of-law approach to fighting terrorism must be a pillar of European cooperation with third countries, namely with those of the Mediterranean, or with Pakistan, thereby contributing to a security culture that is conducive to democratization.
Deepening democracy in turn means allowing full civic participation, including non-violent Islamic groups.
The right to public speech and peaceful assembly must be defended for those who feel marginalized and indignant at what they – and most Europeans – view as injustices committed against the Palestinians, the Chechens, and the Iraqis.
Last, but not least, combating identity-based extremism calls for a greater capacity to integrate all those who live within the EU.
The response to terrorism should be to reaffirm the value of the rule of law over arbitrary repression, and of the diversity that is the hallmark of Europe’s cities, particularly London and Paris, but increasingly many others across the Union.
We cannot – indeed, must not – cede to terror by building walls around and within our societies.
The best response to intolerant extremism is to cultivate an open and pluralistic society that treats all those who live within its borders as full citizens.
Europe turned diversity into one of its constitutional traits, and this is why it has had such an impact on the world.
Protecting that essence is the best way to honor the memory of the victims of terror, be they from London, Sharm el-Sheik, Madrid, Casablanca, or New York.
Fighting the "New" Terrorism
As the US presidential heats up, critics argue that President George W. Bush's war in Iraq has made the problem of combating terrorism worse.
It is a serious charge, because the world needs a broader strategy against terrorism.
Terrorism is nothing new, nor is it a single enemy.
It is a longstanding method of conflict frequently defined as deliberate attack on the innocent with the objective of spreading fear.
The attacks on New York and Washington of 2001 were dramatic escalations of an age-old phenomenon.
Terrorism today, however, is different from what it was in the past.
Nowadays, instruments of mass destruction are smaller, cheaper, and more readily available.
Cellular phones were used as timers in the attacks in Madrid last March. Hijacking an airplane is relatively inexpensive.
Finally, the information revolution provides inexpensive means of communication and organization that allow groups once restricted to local and national police jurisdictions to become global.
Al Qaeda is said to have established a network in fifty or more countries.
Changes have also occurred in the motivation and organization of terrorist groups.
Terrorists in the mid-20th century tended to have relatively well-defined political objectives, which were often ill-served by mass murder. Governments supported many covertly.
Toward the century's end, radical groups grew on the fringes of several religions.
Most numerous were the tens of thousands of young Muslims who fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, where they were trained in a wide range of techniques and many were recruited to organizations with an extreme view of the religious obligation of jihad .
These technological and ideological trends increased both the lethality and the difficulty of managing terrorism.
Because of the unprecedented scale of Al Qaeda's attacks, the focus is properly on Islamic extremists.
But it would be a mistake to limit our concern solely to Islamic terrorists, for that would ignore the way that technology is putting into the hands of deviant groups and individuals' destructive capabilities that were once limited primarily to governments and armies.
Deviant individuals and groups exist in all human societies, and they are now empowered in ways that were once unthinkable.
Think, for example of Timothy McVeigh, who bombed the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, or the Aum Shinrykio cult that released poison gas in the Tokyo subway system the same year.
Lethality has been increasing.
In the 1970's, the Palestinian attack on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics and attacks by groups like the Red Brigades galvanized world attention at the cost of dozens of lives.
In the l980's, the worst terrorist incident killed 300 people.
The attacks on America of September 2001 cost several thousand lives.
This escalation occurred without using weapons of mass destruction.
If one imagines a deviant group in some society gaining access to biological or nuclear materials, it is possible terrorists could destroy millions of lives.
To kill so many people in the 20th century, a Hitler or Stalin required the apparatus of a totalitarian government.
It is now easy to envisage extremist groups and individuals killing millions without government help
Politics has plagued efforts to agree on a common definition of terrorism at the United Nations.
Some skeptics argue that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, and that treating suppression of terrorism as a global public good is thus merely the hypocrisy of the powerful trying to disarm the weak.
That need not be the case.
Not all struggles for national liberation turn to deliberate killing of innocents.
Deliberate killing of non-combatants (in war or not) is condemned by most major religions, including Islam.
Such behavior is unacceptable whether it is carried out by the powerful or the weak.
While any definition of terrorism has problems at the margins, the core of terrorism is clear enough to permit efforts to de-legitimize it.
Indeed, many countries are parties to UN conventions that commit them to combating aspects of terrorist behavior, even though the UN has not agreed on a single formal definition.
Today, some states harbor terrorists in order to attack their enemies or because they are too weak to control powerful groups.
If a campaign to suppress terrorism is based on broad coalitions that focus on de-legitimizing attacks on innocent non-combatants, it has some prospect of success.
Indeed, one lesson of the efforts since 2001 is that there is no way to avoid broad cooperation.
In that sense, the metaphor of war - with its emphasis on military force is - misleading.
The metaphor of war was understandable in the aftermath of the 2001 attacks, but creates as many problems as it solves.
How long will the war last and how does it relate to civil liberties and alliances?
Bombing is not an option for fighting terrorist cells in Hamburg, Singapore, or Detroit.
Only close civilian cooperation in intelligence sharing, police work across borders, tracing financial flows, and working to pre-clear cargo manifests and passenger lists can cope with such a threat.
Countries cooperate out of self-interest, but a country's soft or attractive power, not only its military might, affects the degree of cooperation.
That is why critics argue that Bush's policy in Iraq was a mistake.
It squandered American soft power, diverted attention from Afghanistan and Al Qaeda, and created a danger that Iraq may become a haven for terrorists.
But critics of Bush at home and abroad must also realize that, notwithstanding past mistakes, pursuing a common strategy is essential, because terrorism is here to stay.
Fighting Words and False Promises
For almost five years, the â€œwar on terrorâ€ has proved to be a false metaphor that has led to counterproductive and self-defeating policies.
A misleading figure of speech has been applied literally to unleash a real war on several fronts, including Iraq, Gaza, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Somalia.
Thousands of innocent civilians have been killed, enraging millions around the world.
Yet al-Qaeda has not been subdued, as was shown by the recent plot to blow up United States-bound commercial flights from London.
That plot, which could have claimed more victims than the 9/11 attacks, was foiled by the vigilance of the British intelligence authorities.
Clearly, it wonâ€™t be the last.
Unfortunately, the American public accepted uncritically the war metaphor as the obvious response to 9/11.
Indeed, even now, when it is widely admitted that the invasion of Iraq was a blunder, the â€œwar on terrorâ€ remains the frame into which American policy has to fit.
Most Democratic politicians, too, subscribe to it for fear of being branded as weak on defense.
But continuing support for the war on terror makes it no less self-defeating.
By its very nature, war creates innocent victims, and this even more likely when it is waged against terrorists, because terrorists tend to keep their whereabouts hidden.
The deaths, injuries, and humiliation of civilians generate rage and resentment among their families and communities, in turn fueling support for terrorists.
Moreover, terrorism is an abstraction that lumps together all political movements that use terrorist tactics.
Al-Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Sunni insurrection and the Mahdi army in Iraq are very different forces, but President George W. Bushâ€™s global war on terror prevents us from differentiating between them and dealing with them accordingly.
It inhibits much-needed negotiations with Iran and Syria, because they are states that support terrorist groups.
At the same time, as the British have shown, groups like al-Qaeda are best dealt with by good intelligence.
The war on terrorâ€™s emphasis on military action merely increases the terrorist threat and makes the task of the intelligence agencies more difficult.
Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri are still at large, and we need to focus on finding them if we are to prevent attacks like the one foiled in England.
Finally, the war on terror drives a wedge between â€œusâ€ and â€œthem.â€ We are innocent victims; they are perpetrators.
While we seem not to notice that we also become perpetrators in the process, much of the rest of the world does notice â€“ a gap in perception that has severely weakened Americaâ€™s international credibility and standing.
Taken together, these factors ensure that the war on terror cannot be won.
On the contrary, an endless war waged against an unseen enemy is doing great damage not only to our authority and prestige in the world, but also to our own society.
It has led to a dangerous extension of executive powers, tarnished our adherence to universal human rights, and inhibited the critical process that is at the heart of an open society.
It has also cost a lot of money.
Most importantly, the war on terror has diverted attention from other urgent tasks that require American leadership, such as finishing the job that we correctly began in Afghanistan, addressing the looming global energy crisis, and dealing with nuclear proliferation.
With American influence at low ebb, the world is in danger of sliding into a vicious cycle of escalating violence.
We can escape it only if we Americans repudiate the war on terror as a false metaphor.
If we persevere on our current course, the situation will continue to deteriorate.
It is not our will that is being tested, but our understanding of reality.
It is painful to admit that our predicaments are brought about by our own misconceptions.
But not admitting it is bound to prove even more painful in the long run.
The strength of an open society lies in its ability to recognize and correct its mistakes.
That is the test that now confronts us.
Can Fillon Beat Le Pen?
CAMBRIDGE – In the French Republican party’s presidential primary on Sunday, François Fillon soundly defeated frontrunner Alain Juppé, winning close to 67% of the votes.
Two weeks ago, a landslide victory for the apparent underdog seemed out of the question.
It had long been expected that Juppé, the mayor of Bordeaux and a former prime minister under President Jacques Chirac, would beat the other frontrunner, former President Nicolas Sarkozy, in a second-round runoff.
Instead, Fillon, a former prime minister under Sarkozy, emerged from the first round with a commanding lead, winning 44% of the vote.
The outcome was a humiliating one for Sarkozy, who received just a little over 20% support, and effectively ended his political career.
For many observers, the vote invoked the specter of June’s Brexit referendum and US President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier this month.
Opinion polls placing Fillon as a distant third were proven wrong, partly because many voters seem to have made up their minds just days before the vote.
Social media were also credited, again, with playing a key role.
In the last debates before the vote, Fillon presented himself as a credible alternative to Juppé and Sarkozy.
With incumbent President François Hollande’s approval ratings below 5% – the lowest ever for a French president – the big question now is whether Fillon can beat far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen in the second round of the presidential election in May 2017.
Juppé was seen as a sufficiently “soft” candidate, who would provide an alternative to Le Pen for left-wing voters.
Fillon, however, is much further to the right than Juppé, which means that left-wing voters might not see much difference between him and Le Pen, and could demand that a center-left third candidate enter the fray.
One contender is the centrist Emmanuel Macron, who says he will run but refuses to stand in the Socialist Party primary this January.
Without major-party backing beyond his own En Marche! movement, however, Macron is unlikely to be able to muster the support needed to win the presidency (he currently has just 14% support).
And, as a banker-turned-reformist economy minister under Hollande, Macron is an ideal target for Le Pen’s anti-elitist, anti-European rhetoric.
Beyond Macron, the left is struggling to put forward a credible candidate.
Holland’s reelection chances are dismal; his loyal prime minister, Manuel Valls, is expected to announce his own candidacy this week, but is polling only marginally better than Hollande, at 9%.
That leaves only the far-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon (13%) and the photogenic but waffling Arnaud Montebourg, whom Macron succeeded as economy minister.
If no leftist candidate makes it to the second round, voters on the left could cast their votes for “Republican unity,” as they did in 2002, when they handed Chirac a landslide victory over Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen.
Leftist voters would have preferred Juppé, and will likely tolerate Fillon, but they comprised only 15% of total voters in the first round of the Republican primary, so they may not have the same impact in 2017 as they did in 2002.
Fillon’s political base is dominated by provincial, retired Catholic men, who turned out in force for both rounds of the primaries.
Fillon’s supporters seem to be united in their opposition to gay marriage, and Fillon, as an avowed Catholic, was the most socially conservative candidate on offer.
While Fillon does not want to revoke same-sex couples’ legal right to marry, he opposes granting them the right to adopt children.
Geographically, Fillon won almost everywhere outside of Juppé’s Bordeaux bastion, including the southern Mediterranean Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur (PACA) region, which was originally Sarkozy’s strongest base of support.
But PACA is also the National Front’s stronghold, which means that Fillon will have to distinguish himself from Le Pen as a right-wing candidate, lest voters decide they would prefer the original to the copy.
There are a few areas where Fillon and Le Pen differ.
For starters, Florian Philippot, one of Le Pen’s deputies, is openly gay, and Le Pen has been careful not to take a strong position on social issues.
Fillon is also an economic liberal – and is often characterized as a French Margaret Thatcher – whereas Le Pen is a protectionist.
And while Fillon wants to reduce the French civil service by 500,000, Le Pen favors a strong state.
Finally, Le Pen opposes France’s membership in the European Union and wants to return to the franc, while Fillon would prefer to delegate power back to national assemblies.
Heading into the election campaign, Fillon may run on a pro-European platform, as evidenced by his pivot during the second-round debates, when he suggested that he favors forming a eurozone government.
Unlike Trump and the United Kingdom’s “Leave” campaign, the National Front already has a predictable core constituency, amounting to about one-quarter of the electorate.
Its coalition of the old French far right and disaffected working-class voters will not arrive unannounced or defy expectations, as happened in the US and the UK.
Fillon, for his part, can probably muster the same level of support, and he may even be able to skim votes from Le Pen, given that around 8% of primary voters described themselves as National Front backers.
What’s more, political Catholicism still appeals to many French voters, and the Church itself wants to lure Catholics away from the National Front and back into its more traditionally conservative fold.
Meanwhile, a number of far-right organizations supported Fillon’s candidacy during the primaries, owing to his strong support for laws that would ban the burkini, a full-body bathing suit worn by Muslim women.
Given the current political field, Fillon will most likely face Le Pen in the presidential election’s second round next May.
Polling after Fillon’s victory put his support at 26%, with Le Pen backed by 24% of respondents.
Fillon, however, is projected to win the second round with 67% of the vote.
We have been here before, and that second-round projection is based on “Republican unity,” which might not hold.
Left-wing voters, put off by Fillon’s liberal economics and social conservatism, might stay home.
Given pollsters’ massive predictive failures elsewhere this year, no one should count on them to turn out until the votes themselves are counted.
Final Thoughts on Secular Stagnation
CAMBRIDGE – Joseph Stiglitz, Roger Farmer, and I are now and have long been in agreement on what are probably the most important points.
The “New Keynesian” paradigm that sees business cycles as arising from temporary rigidities in wages and prices is insufficient to account for events like the Great Depression and the Great Recession.
Too little was done in the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago to stimulate aggregate demand.
A more equal income distribution operates to increase aggregate demand.
Substantially stronger financial regulation than was in place before 2008 needs to be adopted to minimize the risks of future crises.
I continue to have disagreements with Stiglitz on the record of policy advice, and with both Stiglitz and Farmer on some points of theory regarding secular stagnation.
Starting with the policy record, Stiglitz is right to assert that economists should not be expected to agree on issues of political feasibility.
They should, however, be able to agree on what texts say.
The New York Times commentary that Stiglitz proudly cites calls for a stimulus of “at least $600 billion to $1 trillion over two years.”
The Obama administration called for and received stimulus totaling some $800 billion, a figure well within Stiglitz’s range, despite being politically constrained by the necessity of Congressional approval.
So I’m not sure what he is claiming.
Stiglitz asserts that the study Fannie Mae hired him to write in 2002 said only that its lending practices at that time were safe.
That is not how I read it.
It speaks to ten-year default probabilities of less than one in 500,000; notes that even if the analysis is off by an order of magnitude, any risks to government are very modest; and appeals to the regulatory system in place at the time to minimize that their model missed risks.
He makes arguments against the Congressional Budget Office, the Department of the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve, all of which had suggested – based on the same information available to Stiglitz when he wrote his paper – that implicit guarantees to Fannie Mae were potentially costly.
I am not sure what point Joe is making with respect to derivatives.
I was clear in my article to which he is responding that I wish we had not supported the 2000 legislation.
But I also noted that there is no reason to think that, in the absence of the legislation, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under the Bush administration would have asserted sweeping new authority over derivatives and pointed to the legal certainty problem that career lawyers thought was important to address.
What about secular stagnation theory?
Stiglitz and I agree that Alvin Hansen’s prediction was not borne out after World War II because of a combination of expansionary policy and structural changes in the economy.
This was my point five years ago in renewing the idea of secular stagnation – to suggest that the economy as it was in 2013 required some combination of fiscal expansion and structural change to sustain full employment.
My discussions of secular stagnation have all emphasized a variety of structural factors, including inequality, high profit shares, changes in relative prices, and global saving patterns.
Where does Stiglitz disagree?
Farmer, in his thoughtful commentary, argues that models of the type he has pioneered in recent years are the right way to think about chronically excessive unemployment and that, with the right microfoundations, one can conclude that fiscal policies are ineffective.
I think his modeling approach may well prove very fruitful, and I wish I understood it better.
But, for now, I find the empirical evidence, international comparisons, time-series studies, and studies of local variation within the United States compelling in suggesting that fiscal policy works.
I do think, however, that Farmer’s views on the use of monetary policy to stabilize asset prices deserve serious consideration.
Finally, I hope Stiglitz will respond positively to my repeated suggestions that we debate these matters in person at Columbia or Harvard or some other suitable venue.
We can all agree that the stakes in a better understanding of the lessons of macroeconomic history, and in avoiding future events like those of the last decade, are very high.
Finance Agonistes
LONDON – For at least a quarter-century, the financial sector has grown far more rapidly than the economy as a whole, both in developed and in most developing countries.
The ratio of total financial assets (stocks, bonds, and bank deposits) to GDP in the United Kingdom was about 100% in 1980, while by 2006 it had risen to around 440%.
In China, financial assets went from being virtually non-existent to well over 300% of GDP during this period.
As the size of the financial industry grew, so, too, did its profitability.
The share of total profits of companies in the United States represented by financial firms rocketed from 10% in 1980 to 40% in 2006.
Against that background, it is not surprising that pay in the financial sector soared.
The City of London, lower Manhattan, and a few other centers became money machines that made investment bankers, hedge-fund managers, and private equity folk immoderately wealthy.
University leaders like me spent much of our time persuading them to recycle a portion of their gains to their old schools.
For the last two years, things have been different.
Many financial firms have shrunk their balance sheets dramatically, and of course some have gone out of business altogether.
Leverage is down sharply. Investment banks with leverage of more than 30 times their capital in early 2007 are now down to little more than ten times.
Trading volumes are down, as is bank lending, and there have been major layoffs in financial centers around the globe.
Is this a short-term phenomenon, and will we see an early return to rapid financial-sector growth as soon as the world economy recovers?
Already the market is full of rumors that guaranteed bonuses are returning, that hedge funds are making double-digit returns, and that activity is reviving in the private equity market.
Are these harbingers of a robust recovery for the financial sector, or just urban myths?
There is no certain answer to that question, but perhaps economic history can offer some clues.
A recent analysis by Andy Haldane of the Bank of England of long-term returns on UK financial sector equities suggests that the last 25 years have been very unusual.
Suppose you had placed a long-term bet on financial equities in 1900, along with a short bet on general equities – in effect a gamble on whether the UK financial sector would outperform the market.
For the first 85 years, this would have been a very uninteresting gamble, generating an average return of only around 2% a year.
But the period from 1986 to 2006 was radically different.
During those two decades, your annual average return would have been more than 16%.
As Haldane puts it, “banking became the goose laying the golden eggs.”
Indeed, there is no period in recent UK financial history that bears any comparison to those jamboree decades.
If you had unwound your bet three years ago, you would now be sitting pretty – as long as you had gone into cash, of course – because the period since 2006 has undone most of these gains.
So if you had held your bank stocks up to the end of last year, over 110 years your investment would have yielded an annual average return of less than 3%, still broadly a break-even strategy.
Why was this 20-year experience so unusual, with returns so much higher than at any time in the last century?
The most straightforward answer seems to be leverage.
Banks geared up dramatically, in a competitive race to generate higher returns.
Haldane describes this as resorting to the roulette wheel.
Perhaps that analogy is rather insulting to those who play roulette.
Indeed, the phrase “casino banking” tends to ignore the fact that casinos have a rather good handle on their returns.
They are typically very astute at risk management, unlike many of the banks that dramatically increased their leverage – and thus their risks – during the last 20 years.
The conclusions that we might draw for the future depend heavily on how central banks and regulators react to the crisis.
At present, financial firms are learning the lessons for themselves, reducing leverage and hoarding capital and cash, whereas the authorities are trying to persuade banks to expand lending – precisely the strategy that led to the current crisis.
Of course, we know that a different approach will be needed in the longer run.
In effect, the authorities are following the approach first outlined by St. Augustine.
They would like banks to be “chaste,” but not yet.
But when growth does return, leverage will be far more tightly constrained than it was before.
Regulators are already talking about imposing leverage ratios, as well as limits on risk-weighted assets.
If they follow through, as I expect, there will be no return to the strategies of the last two decades.
In that case, finance will no longer be an industry that systematically outpaces the rest of the economy.
There will be winners and losers, of course, but systematic sectoral out-performance looks unlikely.
What that will mean for financial-sector pay is a slightly more complex question, to which I will return.
Financing the Climate-Change Transition
POTSDAM, PARIS, ZURICH – Unless the world reduces greenhouse-gas emissions rapidly, humanity is likely to enter an era of unprecedented climate risks.
Devastating extreme-weather events are already increasing in frequency, but much of the worst climate-related damage, such as a sustained rise in sea levels, will be recognized only once it is too late to act.
Clearly, the climate system’s time horizon does not align well with the world’s much shorter political and economic cycles.
Listed companies report on a quarterly basis, and recent regulatory changes, such as those mandating increased use of mark-to-market accounting, limit long-term thinking.
Governments usually have legislative cycles of no more than four years, and they must also respond to immediate developments.
Yet stabilizing the climate requires sustained and consistent action over an extended period.
AXA and UBS, together with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), and the EU’s Climate-KIC (Knowledge and Information Community) recently organized a conference in Berlin.
There, they discussed with leading experts in green investments and fossil-fuel divestment how financial intermediaries can help to address climate risks.
The financial industry’s active involvement is urgently needed.
In the Paris climate agreement reached last December, countries worldwide agreed to limit global warming to well below 2° Celsius, thereby defining the track on which the world must progress rapidly.
Over the next 15 years, an estimated $93 trillion will be needed for investments in low-carbon infrastructure.
Government funding alone cannot meet this demand, so the financial sector must help fill the gap.
By redirecting capital flows toward proactive efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change, financial institutions can protect client assets from global climate risks, and from the economic risks that will attend a warming planet.
They are also demonstrating their social responsibility for the wellbeing of future generations.
But financing change requires changing finance.
And this process is already underway.
Development institutions such as the World Bank are reconsidering their investment policies.
And, in the private sector, there is growing enthusiasm for “green” bonds, loans, indices, and infrastructure investments.
Still, as the European Commission notes, less than 1% of institutional assets worldwide are invested in environmentally friendly infrastructure assets.
Given historically low interest rates and the general lack of attractive investment options, this is an ideal moment to tap into investors’ growing appetite for green financial products.
Many large financial institutions have recently joined a global initiative promoting fossil-fuel divestment.
Research findings indicate that global CO2 emissions must be restricted to less than one trillion metric tons between 2010 and the end of the century to comply with the Paris agreement and limit global warming to below 2°C. This means that most available coal, oil, and gas reserves must stay in the ground.
As a result, investments in fossil-fuel energy sources will continue to lose value over time, eventually becoming stranded.
Thus, the financial sector’s revaluation of such holdings not only helps to stabilize the climate, but also better protects its clients’ investments, and, by preventing the creation of a “carbon bubble,” helps to stabilize economies.
But selling off these holdings will not suffice; the freed-up assets must also be redirected to more sustainable businesses.
For financial institutions and investors to do their part, they urgently need a better understanding of the relevant climate-related investment risks, which the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has divided into three categories: physical, transitional, and liability.
Informed investment decisions will require sound, scientifically grounded data and uniform standards to assess these risks, and to quantify opportunities against them.
Effective disclosure will hence be a key part of any new framework.
An FSB taskforce – comprising representatives from banks, insurers, institutional investors, rating agencies, consultants, and auditors – is currently shaping voluntary standards, so that companies provide consistent and comparable climate-related financial disclosures to their stakeholders, whether investors or lenders.
This will also allow companies to gain valuable insights into their own potential for change, reflecting a time-honored principle: what gets measured, gets managed.
This is no easy task.
For example, carbon footprints on their own will not steer investments in the right direction.
Instead of identifying the champions of environmentally friendly solutions, these figures merely reveal which companies currently emit the most greenhouse gases.
Meaningful disclosure standards must take account of sector-specific information and the impact on business strategies of the transition toward a low-carbon economy.
All the governments that signed the Paris agreement can now be expected to adopt a range of measures to enable them to implement their de-carbonization strategies.
In this context, carbon pricing will be an essential part of the policy toolbox.
Some governments have already taken steps to promote the development of green products, via tax or market incentives.
Overall, such changes to legal frameworks must support, not impede, the private financial sector’s efforts to tackle climate change.
Financing the infrastructure projects that are too expensive for some national governments to finance on their own, but that are essential to the transformation of our energy system – such as wind farms and long-distance power lines – will require a new class of global infrastructure bonds.
In the past, governments have encouraged investment in government bonds.
Now, in order to increase private investment in building up clean infrastructure, investor-protection measures and dispute-resolution mechanisms must be considered.
The financial sector is ready to spearhead the shift to sustainability.
When Germany takes over the G20 presidency next year, it will have the opportunity to convince its partners to create an adequate framework to encourage change in the financial sector that ensures a smooth adjustment to a low-carbon economy.
For both public and private actors, the time to act is now.
A Climate-Friendly Financial System
BEIJING/FRANKFURT – The climate conference now underway in Katowice, Poland, has been billed as the most consequential since the 2015 summit, which produced the Paris climate agreement.
Amid unprecedented public concern over the threat posed by climate change – fueled by an alarming recent report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), not to mention devastating natural disasters around the world – negotiators are seeking to establish a set of rules for meeting the Paris commitments.
But, as is so often the case, success will depend on finance.
The world’s advanced economies have made major financial commitments in previous climate negotiations. Yet it is far from certain that they will fulfill their promises, beginning with the provision of $100 billion annually to developing countries by 2020.
According to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change’s Standing Committee on Finance (SCF), public finance from developed to developing countries to support climate-change mitigation and adaptation amounted to $57 billion in 2016.
When taking account of private finance mobilized by public support, flows reached over $70 billion in 2016.
However, that is a small fraction of the $2.4 trillion that the world needs to invest in clean energy every year between now and 2035 to keep global temperatures within 1.5°C of pre-industrial levels, as calculated by the IPCC.
Whether rich countries honor climate financing commitments made in previous negotiations, and the degree to which developing countries can accept flexibility in how financial flows are measured, will be key to advancing the climate talks at this critical time. But, above all, climate risk and consideration of long-term sustainability will need to be embedded in the world’s financial system – from banks, asset owners, and managers to insurance companies and the capital markets that facilitate financial actors’ transactions.
The good news is that the world is already moving in this direction, thanks partly to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, formed in 2015 by the Financial Stability Board and the G20 Sustainable Finance Study Group.
Already, the task force has done much to encourage financial institutions and companies to understand, assess, and disclose the extent of the climate risks they face.
These frameworks and tools are gaining traction and inspiring concrete actions.
The China-United Kingdom Green Finance Taskforce, for example, has established a group of British and Chinese financial institutions to pilot TCFD reporting. It has also developed a set of “Green Investment Principles” to promote low-carbon investments in the region comprising China’s Belt and Road Initiative.
Then there is Climate Action 100+, an investor-led initiative that seeks to motivate companies to achieve the Paris agreement’s goals by improving corporate governance on climate change, curbing emissions, and strengthening climate-related financial disclosures.
So far, 310 investors with more than $32 trillion in assets under management have signed on to the initiative.
While market-based initiatives are important drivers of innovation, governments and regulators also have a crucial role to play in activating green finance and ensuring that climate risks are measured and reported accurately.
Here, steps taken by the European Union and China to steer finance toward low-carbon assets stand out.
The EU’s Action Plan for a greener and cleaner economy has spurred an ambitious agenda to advance the transition to a sustainable financial system.
Draft regulations are designed to encourage financial actors to assess and disclose sustainability risk, while moving toward the establishment of common standards to promote the financial instruments – such as green bonds – that can help direct funding to environment-friendly projects and companies.
EU finance ministers have also just agreed to begin requiring banks to disclose environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks within three years.
As for China, in 2016 the State Council announced a set of comprehensive guidelines for green finance, and the central bank and some local governments have introduced monetary and fiscal incentives for green loans and bonds.
Moreover, the Asset Management Association of the China Securities Regulatory Commission recently released green investment guidelines for the asset-management industry, calling for ESG considerations to be integrated into institutional investors’ decision-making.
The CSRC has also announced a plan to require all listed companies to disclose environmental information by 2020.
At the international level, there is the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System.
Created at the end of last year, the NGFS brings together financial regulators and central banks from 21 countries – including France, China, and Germany – that recognize the threat to financial stability posed by climate change, and the need to assess and manage that risk, in part through prudential supervision.
A central element of such risk management is for banks and investors to shift their portfolios away from high-emitting companies and projects, toward low-carbon assets.
As the IPCC’s recent report makes plain, avoiding the worst effects of climate change will require action on an unprecedented scale – starting immediately.
Policymakers in national capitals must ensure that both public and private financial flows align with the climate agenda, and that the right conditions are created to make the global financial sector the facilitator of, rather than a barrier to, a low-carbon future.
Finance’s Crisis of Legitimacy
WASHINGTON, DC – The recent departure of Robert Diamond from Barclays marks a watershed.
To be sure, CEOs of major banks have been forced out before.
Chuck Prince lost his job at Citigroup over excessive risk-taking in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008, and, more recently, Oswald Grübel of UBS was pushed out for failing to prevent unauthorized trading to the tune of $2.3 billion.
But Diamond was a banker supposedly at the top of his game.
Barclays, it was claimed, had come through the 2008-2009 crisis without benefiting from government support.
And, while his bank had been found in violation of various rules recently, including on products sold to consumers and on how it reported interest rates, Diamond had managed to distance himself from the damage.
Press reports indicate that regulators were willing to give Diamond a free pass – right up to the moment when a serious political backlash took hold.
Diamond started to fight back, pointing an accusatory finger at the Bank of England.
At that point, he had to go.
There are three broader lessons of Diamond’s demise at Barclays.
First, the political backlash was not from backbenchers or uninformed spectators on the margins of the mainstream.
Top politicians from all parties in the United Kingdom were united in condemning Barclays’ actions, particularly with regard to its systemic cheating on the reporting of interest rates, exposed in the Libor scandal.
(The London Interbank Offered Rate is a key benchmark for borrowing and lending around the world, including for the pricing of derivatives).
Indeed, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne went so far as to say, “Fraud is a crime in ordinary business; why shouldn’t it be so in banking?”
His clear implication is that fraud was committed at Barclays – a serious allegation from Britain’s finance minister.
After five years of global financial-sector scandals on a grand scale, patience is wearing thin.
As Eduardo Porter of The New York Times put it,
“Bigger markets allow bigger frauds.
Bigger companies, with more complex balance sheets, have more places to hide them.
And banks, when they get big enough that no government will let them fail, have the biggest incentive of all.”
Second, Diamond apparently thought that he could take on the British establishment.
His staff leaked the contents of a conversation he claimed to have had with Paul Tucker, a senior Bank of England official, suggesting that the BoE had told Barclays to report inaccurate interest-rate numbers.
Diamond apparently forgot that the continued existence of any bank with a balance sheet that is large relative to its home economy – and its ability to earn a return for shareholders – depends entirely on maintaining a good relationship with regulators.
Barclays has total assets of around $2.5 trillion – roughly the size of the UK’s annual GDP – and is either the fifth- or eighth-largest bank in the world, depending on how one measures balance sheets.
Banks at this scale benefit from huge implicit government guarantees; this is what it means to be “too big to fail.”
Diamond apparently believed his own rhetoric – that he and his bank are critical to economic prosperity in the UK.
The regulators called his bluff and forced him to resign.
Barclays’ stock price rose slightly on the news.
The final lesson is that the big showdowns between democracy and big bankers are still to come – both in the United States and in continental Europe.
On the surface, the banks remain powerful, yet their legitimacy continues to crumble.
Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, presided this year over reckless risk-taking to the tune of nearly $6 billion (we might call it a “three Grübel” debacle), yet his job apparently remains secure.
Dimon even remains on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, despite the fact that the New York Fed is deeply involved in the investigation not only of JP Morgan Chase’s trading losses, but also of its potential involvement in the broadening Libor scandal.
As Dennis Kelleher, the president of the advocacy group Better Markets, documented in recent congressional testimony, two years after the passage of the Dodd-Frank legislation, the US banking system continues to fight hard – and effectively – to undermine meaningful reform.
(Kelleher’s testimony is a must-read assessment, as is his opening statement to the hearing).
But progress is nonetheless being made.
Dimon is the public face of megabanks’ resistance to reform; repeated and public egg on this particular face strengthens those who want to rein in these banks’ excessive and irresponsible risk-taking.
Meanwhile, the European situation looks explosive.
The European Union’s approach to bank regulation encouraged financial institutions to load up on government debt – supposedly a “risk-free” asset.
Now, given the profound sovereign-debt crisis in the eurozone periphery, government defaults threaten to take down the big banks.
The European Central Bank has provided a great deal of emergency “liquidity” funding to banks, which they use to buy even more government debt.
This holds down interest rates on that debt in the short run, but creates even bigger potential losses in the case of potential default.
Banks and politics are deeply intertwined in all advanced economies.
Diamond discovered that, ultimately, politicians trump bankers – at least in the UK.
But what really matters is legitimacy and informed public opinion.
Do you really believe the increasingly dubious notion that megabanks, as currently constituted, are good for the rest of the private sector, and thus for economic growth and job creation?
Or do you begin to consider more seriously the increasingly mainstream proposition that global megabanks and their leaders have simply become too powerful and dangerous?
The Varoufakis Effect?
ATHENS – In his end-of-2015 missive, Holger Schmieding of the Hamburg investment bank Berenberg warned his firm’s clients that what they should be worrying about now is political risk.
To illustrate, he posted the diagram below, showing how business confidence collapsed in Greece during the late spring of 2015, and picked up again only after my resignation from the finance ministry.
Schmieding chose to call this the “Varoufakis effect.”
There is no doubt that investors should be worried – very worried – about political risk nowadays, including the capacity of politicians and bureaucrats to do untold damage to an economy.
But they must also be wary of analysts who are either incapable of, or uninterested in, distinguishing between causality and correlation, and between insolvency and illiquidity.
In other words, they must be wary of analysts like Schmieding.
Business confidence in Greece did indeed plummet a few months after I became Finance Minister.
And it did pick up a month after my resignation.
The correlation is palpable.
But is the causality?
Consider the following example.
Business confidence fell in September 2001 (following the terror attacks on New York and Washington, DC), while Paul O’Neill was US Treasury Secretary.
Would Schmieding label a chart showing that decline the “O’Neill Effect”?
Of course not: the drop in business confidence had nothing to do with O’Neill and everything to do with fears about global security.
The correlation with O’Neill’s tenure was irrelevant.
Similarly, in the case of Greece, the collapse in business confidence happened under my watch.
But the cause was that our creditors, the so-called Troika (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund), made clear that they would close down our banking system to force our government to accept a fresh extend-and-pretend loan agreement.
Before these threats were issued, business confidence was actually picking up in Greece.
Indeed, the day after I presented my reform and fiscal proposals to the City of London investor community, stocks rallied impressively.
(Indeed, during my tenure in the finance ministry, real GDP grew more than it had done during the last two quarters of 2014, which Schmieding identifies as a period of increasing confidence.)
So, what caused the huge drop in business confidence during my tenure?
Was it my policy proposals – jointly authored with Jeff Sachs (with input from Norman Lamont, a former Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom, Harvard’s Larry Summers, and James K. Galbraith of the University of Texas) – that were responsible?
Or was it the Troika’s explicit threat of bank closures (which were actually imposed when we dared to put our creditors’ ultimatum to the Greek people in a referendum last July)?
In other words, was it the “Varoufakis effect” or the “Troika effect”?
To answer this question in ways that are helpful to investors, an analyst must at least make an effort to establish whether the observed correlation points to a causal link.
Reading our policy proposals and comparing them to the Troika’s program would have helped.
Unfortunately, this would have required work that some analysts prefer not to do.
The relevant question is whether we were right to confront the Troika – a central plank in our January 2015 electoral platform – or whether we should have signed up to our creditors’ “Greek program.”
My view is that we had no alternative but to resist the Troika’s plan.
The reason is simple: the Greek state became insolvent in early 2010.
From May 2010, this insolvency was addressed by means of sequential extend-and-pretend loans on conditions that were guaranteed to shrink national income, investment, and credit.
A case of insolvency was made increasingly worse by continuing to pretend that it was a mere liquidity problem.
Was the Greek economy on the mend in late 2014?
Of course not.
Nominal GDP never stopped shrinking, public and private debt continued to become less and less sustainable, and all along investment and credit remained comatose.
Without debt restructuring, a low target for the primary budget surplus (net of debt payments), a “bad bank” to deal with non-performing loans, and a comprehensive reform agenda that tackles the worst cases of rent seeking, Greece is condemned to permanent depression.
Alas, the Troika was in politically motivated denial and deeply uninterested in our policy proposals.
Time and again, they simply demanded capitulation.
To be sure, we could have handled that confrontation better.
But for an analyst to blame the victim of such financial violence is not only morally reprehensible, but also constitutes terrible service to his clients (who, for example, may be lulled into a false sense that Greece is on the mend now that Varoufakis has been forced out).
Thankfully, there are diligent analysts, like Mohamed El-Erian, to whom sensible investors can turn.
And their verdict is clear: Greece’s downturn in 2015 was due to the “Troika effect.”
Yes, political risk in Europe is clear and present.
But it emanates from the Troika’s unwillingness to reform itself and to rethink its failed policies.
Author’s postscript: Following the publication of this article, the pernicious “Troika effect” became even clearer when it was revealed that the chart Holger Schmieding used to demonstrate the “Varoufakis effect” was rather economical with the truth.
The original chart (published here) shows clearly that business confidence dove at the end of 2014, well before the Greek election and my appointment as Minister of Finance.
In Schmieding’s letter to his investors, the horizontal axis was stretched to show that business confidence fell well into 2015, once I was in office.
Nothing could better illustrate that investors have much to fear from analysts like Schmieding.
The Political Consequences of Financial Crises
LONDON – I may not be the only finance professor who, when setting essay topics for his or her students, has resorted to a question along the following lines: “In your view, was the global financial crisis caused primarily by too much government intervention in financial markets, or by too little?”
When confronted with this either/or question, my most recent class split three ways.
Roughly a third, mesmerized by the meretricious appeal of the Efficient Market Hypothesis, argued that governments were the original sinners.
Their ill-conceived interventions – notably the US-backed mortgage underwriters Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as the Community Reinvestment Act – distorted market incentives.
Some even embraced the argument of the US libertarian Ron Paul, blaming the very existence of the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort.
Another third, at the opposite end of the political spectrum, saw former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan as the villain.
It was Greenspan’s notorious reluctance to intervene in financial markets, even when leverage was growing dramatically and asset prices seemed to have lost touch with reality, that created the problem.
More broadly, Western governments, with their light-touch approach to regulation, allowed markets to career out of control in the early years of this century.
The remaining third tried to have it both ways, arguing that governments intervened too much in some areas, and too little in others.
Avoiding the question as put is not a sound test-taking strategy; but the students may have been onto something.
Now that the crisis is seven years behind us, how have governments and voters in Europe and North America answered this important question?
Have they shown, by their actions, that they think financial markets need tighter controls or that, on the contrary, the state should repudiate bailouts and leave financial firms to face the full consequences of their own mistakes?
From their rhetoric and regulatory policies, it would appear that most governments have ended up in the third, fence-sitting camp.
Yes, they have implemented a plethora of detailed controls, scrutinizing banks’ books with unprecedented intensity and insisting on approving cash distributions, the appointment of key directors, and even job descriptions for board members.
But they have ruled out any future government or central-bank support for ailing financial institutions.
Banks must now produce “living wills” showing how they can be wound down without the authorities’ support.
The government will wash its hands of them if they run into trouble: the era of “too big to fail” is over.
Perhaps this two-track approach was inevitable, though it would be good to know the desired end-point.
Is it a system in which market discipline again dominates, or will regulators sit on the shoulders of management for the foreseeable future?
But what have voters concluded?
In the first wave of post-crisis elections, the message was clear in one sense, and clouded in another.
Whichever government was in power when the crisis hit, whether left or right, was booted out and replaced by a government of the opposite political persuasion.
That was not universally true – see Germany’s Angela Merkel – but it certainly was true in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and elsewhere.
France moved from right to left, and the UK went from left to right.
But voters’ verdict on their governments was more or less identical: things went wrong on your watch, so out you go.
But now we can see a more consistent trend developing.
Three German economists, Manuel Funke, Moritz Schularik, and Christoph Trebesch, have just produced a fascinating assessment based on more than 800 elections in Western countries over the last 150 years, the results of which they mapped against 100 financial crises.
Their headline conclusion is stark: “politics takes a hard right turn following financial crises.
On average, far-right votes increase by about a third in the five years following systemic banking distress.”
The Great Depression of the 1930s, which followed the Wall Street crash of 1929, is the most obvious and worrying example that comes to mind, but the trend can be observed even in the Scandinavian countries, following banking crises there in the early 1990s.
So seeking to explain, say, the rise of the National Front in France in terms of President François Hollande’s personal and political unpopularity is not sensible.
There are greater forces at work than his exotic private life and inability to connect with voters.
The second major conclusion that Funke, Schularik, and Trebesch draw is that governing becomes harder after financial crises, for two reasons.
The rise of the far right lies alongside a political landscape that is typically fragmented, with more parties, and a lower share of the vote going to the governing party, whether of the left or the right.
So decisive legislative action becomes more challenging.
At the same time, a surge of extra-parliamentary mobilization occurs: more and longer strikes and more and larger demonstrations.
Control of the streets by government is not as secure.
The average number of anti-government demonstrations triples, the frequency of violent riots doubles, and general strikes increase by at least a third.
Greece has boosted those numbers recently.
The only comforting conclusion that the three economists reach is that these effects gradually peter out.
The data tell us that after five years, the worst is over.
That does not seem to be the way things are moving now in Europe, if we look at France’s recent election scare, not to mention Finland and Poland, where right-wing populists have now come to power.
Maybe the answer is that the clock starts ticking on the five years when the crisis is fully over, which is not yet true in Europe.
So politics seems set to remain a difficult trade for some time.
And the bankers and financiers who are widely blamed for the crisis will remain in the sin bin for a while yet, until voters’ expectations of economic and financial stability are more consistently satisfied.
Financial Crisis and War
PRINCETON – The approach of the hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of World War I in 1914 has jolted politicians and commentators worried by the fragility of current global political and economic arrangements.
Indeed, Luxembourg’s prime minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, recently argued that Europe’s growing north-south polarization has set the continent back by a century.
The lessons of 1914 are about more than simply the dangers of national animosities.
The origins of the Great War include a fascinating precedent concerning how financial globalization can become the equivalent of a national arms race, thereby increasing the vulnerability of the international order.
In 1907, a major financial crisis emanating from the United States affected the rest of the world and demonstrated the fragility of the entire international financial system.
The response to the current financial crisis is replaying a similar dynamic.
Walter Bagehot’s 1873 classic Lombard Street described the City of London as “the greatest combination of economic power and economic delicacy that the world has ever seen.”
In one influential interpretation, popularized by the novelist, Labour Party MP, and future Nobel Peace Prize laureate Norman Angell in 1910, the interdependency of the increasingly complex global economy made war impossible.
But the opposite conclusion was equally plausible: Given the extent of fragility, a clever twist to the control levers might facilitate a military victory by the economic hegemon.
The aftermath of the 1907 crash drove the hegemonic power of the time – Great Britain – to reflect on how it could use its financial clout to enhance its overall strategic capacity.
That is the conclusion of an important recent book, Nicholas Lambert’s study of British economic planning and the First World War, entitled Planning Armageddon.
Lambert demonstrates how, in a grand strategic gamble, Britain began to marry its military – and especially naval – predominance and its global financial leadership.
Between 1905 and 1908, the British Admiralty developed the broad outlines of a plan for financial and economic warfare against Europe’s rising power, Germany.
Economic warfare, if implemented in full, would wreck Germany’s financial system and force it out of any military conflict.
When Britain’s naval visionaries confronted a rival in the form of the Kaiser’s Germany, they understood how power could thrive on financial fragility.
Pre-1914 Britain anticipated the private-public partnership that today links technology giants such as Google, Apple, or Verizon to US intelligence agencies.
London banks underwrote most of the world’s trade; Lloyds provided insurance for the world’s shipping.
These financial networks provided the information that enabled the British government to discover the sensitive strategic vulnerabilities of the opposing alliance.
For Britain’s rivals, the financial panic of 1907 demonstrated the necessity of mobilizing financial power themselves.
The US, for its part, recognized that it needed a central bank analogous to the Bank of England.
American financiers were persuaded that New York needed to develop its own commercial trading system to handle bills of exchange in the same way as the London market and arrange their monetization (or “acceptance”).
The central figure in pushing for the development of an American acceptance market was Paul Warburg, the immigrant younger brother of a great Hamburg banker who was the personal adviser to Germany’s Kaiser Wilhelm II.
The Warburg brothers, Max and Paul, were a transatlantic tandem, energetically pushing for German-American institutions that would offer an alternative to British industrial and financial monopoly.
They were convinced that Germany and the US were growing stronger year by year, while British power would erode.
Some of the dynamics of the pre-1914 financial world are now reemerging.
In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, financial institutions appear both as dangerous weapons of mass economic destruction, but also as potential instruments for the application of national power.
In managing the 2008 crisis, foreign banks’ dependence on US-dollar funding constituted a major weakness, and required the provision of large swap lines by the Federal Reserve.
Addressing that flaw requires renationalization of banking, and breaking up the activities of large financial institutions.
For European bankers, and some governments, current efforts by the US to revise its approach to the operation of foreign bank subsidiaries within its territory highlight that imperative.
They view the US move as a new sort of financial protectionism and are threatening retaliation.
Geopolitics is intruding into banking practice elsewhere as well.
Russian banks are trying to acquire assets in Central and Eastern Europe.
European banks are playing a much-reduced role in Asian trade finance.
Chinese banks are being pushed to expand their role in global commerce.
Many countries have begun to look at financial protectionism as a way to increase their political leverage.
The next step in this logic is to think about how financial power can be directed to national advantage in the case of a diplomatic conflict.
Sanctions are a routine (and not terribly successful) part of the pressure applied to rogue states like Iran and North Korea.
But financial pressure can be much more powerfully applied to countries that are deeply embedded in the global economy.
In 1907, in the wake of an epochal financial crisis that almost brought a complete global collapse, several countries started to think of finance primarily as an instrument of raw power that could and should be turned to national advantage.
That kind of thinking brought war in 1914.
A century later, in 2007-2008, the world experienced an even greater financial shock, and nationalistic passions have flared up in its wake.
Destructive strategies may not be far behind.
The Makings of a 2020 Recession and Financial Crisis
NEW YORK – As we mark the decennial of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, there are still ongoing debates about the causes and consequences of the financial crisis, and whether the lessons needed to prepare for the next one have been absorbed.
But looking ahead, the more relevant question is what actually will trigger the next global recession and crisis, and when.
The current global expansion will likely continue into next year, given that the US is running large fiscal deficits, China is pursuing loose fiscal and credit policies, and Europe remains on a recovery path.
But by 2020, the conditions will be ripe for a financial crisis, followed by a global recession.
There are 10 reasons for this. First, the fiscal-stimulus policies that are currently pushing the annual US growth rate above its 2% potential are unsustainable.
By 2020, the stimulus will run out, and a modest fiscal drag will pull growth from 3% to slightly below 2%.
Second, because the stimulus was poorly timed, the US economy is now overheating, and inflation is rising above target.
The US Federal Reserve will thus continue to raise the federal funds rate from its current 2% to at least 3.5% by 2020, and that will likely push up short- and long-term interest rates as well as the US dollar.
Meanwhile, inflation is also increasing in other key economies, and rising oil prices are contributing additional inflationary pressures.
That means the other major central banks will follow the Fed toward monetary-policy normalization, which will reduce global liquidity and put upward pressure on interest rates.
Third, the Trump administration’s trade disputes with China, Europe, Mexico, Canada, and others will almost certainly escalate, leading to slower growth and higher inflation.
Fourth, other US policies will continue to add stagflationary pressure, prompting the Fed to raise interest rates higher still.
The administration is restricting inward/outward investment and technology transfers, which will disrupt supply chains. It is restricting the immigrants who are needed to maintain growth as the US population ages.
It is discouraging investments in the green economy. And it has no infrastructure policy to address supply-side bottlenecks.
Fifth, growth in the rest of the world will likely slow down – more so as other countries will see fit to retaliate against US protectionism.
China must slow its growth to deal with overcapacity and excessive leverage; otherwise a hard landing will be triggered.
And already-fragile emerging markets will continue to feel the pinch from protectionism and tightening monetary conditions in the US.
Sixth, Europe, too, will experience slower growth, owing to monetary-policy tightening and trade frictions.
Moreover, populist policies in countries such as Italy may lead to an unsustainable debt dynamic within the eurozone.
The still-unresolved “doom loop” between governments and banks holding public debt will amplify the existential problems of an incomplete monetary union with inadequate risk-sharing.
Under these conditions, another global downturn could prompt Italy and other countries to exit the eurozone altogether.
Seventh, US and global equity markets are frothy.
Price-to-earnings ratios in the US are 50% above the historic average, private-equity valuations have become excessive, and government bonds are too expensive, given their low yields and negative term premia.
And high-yield credit is also becoming increasingly expensive now that the US corporate-leverage rate has reached historic highs.
Moreover, the leverage in many emerging markets and some advanced economies is clearly excessive.
Commercial and residential real estate is far too expensive in many parts of the world.
The emerging-market correction in equities, commodities, and fixed-income holdings will continue as global storm clouds gather.
And as forward-looking investors start anticipating a growth slowdown in 2020, markets will reprice risky assets by 2019.
Eighth, once a correction occurs, the risk of illiquidity and fire sales/undershooting will become more severe.
There are reduced market-making and warehousing activities by broker-dealers.
Excessive high-frequency/algorithmic trading will raise the likelihood of “flash crashes.”
And fixed-income instruments have become more concentrated in open-ended exchange-traded and dedicated credit funds.
In the case of a risk-off, emerging markets and advanced-economy financial sectors with massive dollar-denominated liabilities will no longer have access to the Fed as a lender of last resort.
With inflation rising and policy normalization underway, the backstop that central banks provided during the post-crisis years can no longer be counted on.
Ninth, Trump was already attacking the Fed when the growth rate was recently 4%.
Just think about how he will behave in the 2020 election year, when growth likely will have fallen below 1% and job losses emerge.
The temptation for Trump to “wag the dog” by manufacturing a foreign-policy crisis will be high, especially if the Democrats retake the House of Representatives this year.
Since Trump has already started a trade war with China and wouldn’t dare attack nuclear-armed North Korea, his last best target would be Iran.
By provoking a military confrontation with that country, he would trigger a stagflationary geopolitical shock not unlike the oil-price spikes of 1973, 1979, and 1990.
Needless to say, that would make the oncoming global recession even more severe.
Finally, once the perfect storm outlined above occurs, the policy tools for addressing it will be sorely lacking.
The space for fiscal stimulus is already limited by massive public debt.
The possibility for more unconventional monetary policies will be limited by bloated balance sheets and the lack of headroom to cut policy rates.
And financial-sector bailouts will be intolerable in countries with resurgent populist movements and near-insolvent governments.
In the US specifically, lawmakers have constrained the ability of the Fed to provide liquidity to non-bank and foreign financial institutions with dollar-denominated liabilities.
And in Europe, the rise of populist parties is making it harder to pursue EU-level reforms and create the institutions necessary to combat the next financial crisis and downturn.
Unlike in 2008, when governments had the policy tools needed to prevent a free fall, the policymakers who must confront the next downturn will have their hands tied while overall debt levels are higher than during the previous crisis.
When it comes, the next crisis and recession could be even more severe and prolonged than the last.
A Crisis Playbook for Big Tech
OXFORD – The predictions were wrong: the global economy didn’t collapse after the 2008 financial crisis.
Buoyed by taxpayer-financed bailouts, banks recovered and business at most institutions stabilized.
But if there is one lingering casualty of that era, it is the erosion of public trust in the financial sector.
Ten years after the crisis began, Main Street still has little faith in Wall Street.
A similar crisis of confidence plagues the technology industry today.
As executives at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica rationalize their companies’ use and abuse of personal data, trust in technology firms is approaching a tipping point.
“Big Tech” can still salvage its reputation, but its most powerful companies will need to change fundamentally how they operate.
And to do that, they must avoid the mistakes that nearly crippled the financial sector a decade ago.
Five key lessons from the financial crisis should guide decision-making in the tech sector today.
First, consumer illiteracy can be costly.
Shortly before the housing bubble burst, many investors realized they had no understanding of the products they were buying; some didn’t even know they were buying anything.
Financial journalism contributed to this atmosphere of ignorance by focusing only on the potential gains, and ignoring the risks.
People engage with technology in similar ways.
Companies, governments, and businesses happily plug their entire operations into platforms they cannot control.
Doubt, if it does arise, is usually subdued, because the technology is too convenient to abandon.
But, just like perilous financial products, the only way to mitigate the risks of new technologies is to be fully educated about what could go wrong.
The second lesson is that hidden costs add up.
Before the financial crisis, many customers were sold products with undisclosed fees and financial add-ons that became massive liabilities.
Today, more investors recognize that higher returns imply higher risk, but in the technology business, hidden costs continue to entrap unsuspecting consumers.
Some of these costs are social – like being pressured by advertisers to buy products.
And others are more tangible, like giving away personal data in exchange for access to a service.
Third, inequitable pay and incentive structures are bad for business.
Much has been written about the extraordinary bonuses paid to investment bankers during the height of the financial crisis.
But the CEOs of Silicon Valley are no Robin Hoods, either.
Tech entrepreneurs might tell their investors they want to change the world, but many are intoxicated by the idea that the world will be better when they sell their business to the highest bidder.
Fourth, businesses that are male-dominated take more unnecessary risks.
When the history of the financial crisis was being written, many argued that greater gender diversity would have mitigated the damage.
In 2010, two years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Christine Lagarde, then-France’s finance minister, quipped that the crisis would have been less painful if “Lehman Sisters” had been managing the store.
The same logic applies to the tech sector today.
Finally, as we learned a decade ago, the global economy is deeply interconnected; no bank was too big to fail or to be rescued.
This is true for the largest technology companies as well.
The collapse of Amazon or Google – however invulnerable they may seem – would have devastating ripple effects.
While many argue that it would be unwise to regulate technology firms with a view to concerns over censorship and access to knowledge, these companies, like their financial-sector counterparts, have grown too big to be left to their own devices.
In the decade since the financial crisis erupted, structural changes have helped stabilize the banking and financial-services industry.
Regulations have increased transparency and improved consumer awareness.
But the old dynamics, power structures, and bloated pay scales have largely survived.
As a result, the sector’s reputation remains in tatters.
For the technology industry to avoid a similar fate, its leaders must increase consumers’ literacy about the products they offer – and the potential dangers they hold.
CEOs must support regulation, increase workplace diversity, and make compensation and incentive structures more equitable.
Above all, tech leaders should avoid the mistakes made by other industries navigating crisis.
And no industry offers a more relevant case study than the one that almost took down the global economy.
Finishing the Post-Crisis Job
LONDON – August 9, 2017, is the tenth anniversary of the decision by the French bank BNP Paribas to freeze some $2.2 billion worth of money-market funds.
Those of us who were active in financial markets at the time remember that event as the beginning of the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression.
Many economists and financial observers argue that we are still living with the consequences of that crisis, and with the forces that incited it.
This is partly true.
Many developed economies still have in place unconventional monetary policies such as quantitative easing, and both productivity and real (inflation-adjusted) wage growth appear to be mostly stagnant.
But it is important to put these developments in perspective.
Many people, including the Queen of England in November 2008, still ask: “Why did no one see it coming?”
In fact, many financial observers did warn that housing prices in the United States were rising untenably, especially given the lack of domestic personal savings among US consumers.
As Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs at the time, I had written three different papers over a number of years showing that the US current-account deficit was unsustainable.
Unfortunately, these findings largely fell on deaf ears, and the firm’s foreign-exchange salespeople probably got bored passing on yet more of the same pieces to their clients.
At one point in 2007, the US current-account deficit was reported to be 6-7% of GDP (it has since been revised down to around 5% for the full year).
This high figure reflected the fact that the US trade balance had been steadily deteriorating since the 1990s.
In the absence of any obvious negative consequences, however, complacency had set in, and the US continued to spend more than it saved.
Meanwhile, China had spent the 1990s exporting low-value-added products to the rest of the world, not least to US consumers.
In 2007, its current-account surplus was around 10% of GDP – the mirror image of the US.
Whereas the latter was saving too little, China was saving too much.
For some observers, this huge international imbalance was the source of the crisis.
In the years leading up to the crash, they argued that the global financial system was simply doing its job, by finding increasingly clever ways to recycle the surpluses.
Of course, we now know that it performed that job rather poorly.
Much has changed in the intervening decade.
In 2017, China will run a current-account surplus of 1.5-2% of GDP, and the US will most likely run a deficit of around 2% – but possibly as high as 3% – of GDP.
This is a vast improvement for the world’s two largest economies.
Still, other countries have built up ever-larger current-account imbalances over the past decade.
Chief among them is Germany, whose external surplus now exceeds 8% of GDP.
Germany’s current account suggests that there are deep imbalances that could lead to a new crisis if policymaking is not well coordinated.
The last thing that Europe needs is another sudden reversal, as we saw at the height of the Greek debt crisis.
The United Kingdom, for its part, will have a current-account deficit above 3% of GDP this year, which is nearly three times what it was ten years ago.
But that is not to say that the UK’s trade balance has significantly deteriorated.
Rather, it reflects the fact that the UK is a major financial center, and that investment returns have shifted more in the UK than elsewhere.
All told, the global economy today is much healthier than it was ten years ago.
Many are disappointed that real global GDP growth since the crisis has undershot performance in the previous decade.
But since 2009 – the worst year of the recession – the global economy has grown at an average rate of 3.3%, just as it did in the 1980s and 1990s.
Of course, this is largely owing to China, the only BRIC country (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) that has met my growth expectations for the decade (although India is not too far behind).
The size of China’s economy has more than trebled in nominal terms since 2007, with GDP rising from $3.5 trillion to around $12 trillion.
As a result, the aggregate size of the BRIC economies is now around $18 trillion, which is larger than the European Union and almost as big as the US.
There will inevitably be another financial bubble, so it is worth asking where it might occur.
In my view, it is unlikely to emerge directly from the banking sector, which is now heavily regulated.
The bigger concern is that many leading companies across different industries have continued to focus excessively on quarterly profits, because that determines how executives are remunerated.
Policymakers should take a hard look at the role of share buybacks in this process.
To her credit, in the Conservative Party’s 2017 election manifesto, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that her government would do this.
One hopes that May’s government follows through.
Doing so could strike a symbolic blow against the underlying malaise of post-crisis economic life.
The West needs real investments and higher productivity and wage growth – not more economically unjustifiable profits.
A Financial Early-Warning System
NEW YORK – Recent market volatility – in emerging and developed economies alike – is showing once again how badly ratings agencies and investors can err in assessing countries’ economic and financial vulnerabilities.
Ratings agencies wait too long to spot risks and downgrade countries, while investors behave like herds, often ignoring the build-up of risk for too long, before shifting gears abruptly and causing exaggerated market swings.
Given the nature of market turmoil, an early-warning system for financial tsunamis may be difficult to create; but the world needs one today more than ever.
Few people foresaw the subprime crisis of 2008, the risk of default in the eurozone, or the current turbulence in financial markets worldwide.
Fingers have been pointed at politicians, banks, and supranational institutions.
But ratings agencies and analysts who misjudged the repayment ability of debtors – including governments – have gotten off too lightly.
In principle, credit ratings are based on statistical models of past defaults; in practice, however, with few national defaults having actually occurred, sovereign ratings are often a subjective affair.
Analysts at ratings agencies follow developments in the country for which they are responsible and, when necessary, travel there to review the situation.
This process means that ratings are often backward-looking, downgrades occur too late, and countries are typically rerated based on when analysts visit, rather than when fundamentals change.
Moreover, ratings agencies lack the tools to track consistently vital factors such as changes in social inclusion, the country’s ability to innovate, and private-sector balance-sheet risk.
And yet sovereign ratings matter tremendously.
For many investors, credit ratings dictate where and how much they can invest.
Ratings affect how much banks are willing to lend, and how much developing countries – and their citizens – must pay to borrow.
They inform corporations’ decisions regarding whom to do business with, and on what terms.
Given the problems with ratings agencies, investors and regulators recognize the need for a different approach.
Investors have tried to identify good alternatives – and have largely failed.
Assessments of risk such as sovereign interest-rate spreads and credit default swaps react (and often over-react) fast; but, because they reflect only the market’s understanding of risk, they are not a systematic mechanism for uncovering hidden risks and avoiding crises.
Indeed, the recent sudden rise in market volatility suggests that they are as bad as rating agencies at detecting the early warning signs of trouble.
Regulators, meanwhile, are now starting to require banks to develop their own internal ratings processes.
The problem is that few institutions have the tools and expertise to do this alone.
A comprehensive assessment of a country’s macro investment risk requires looking systematically at the stocks and flows of the national account to capture all dangers, including risk in the financial system and the real economy, as well as wider risk issues.
As we have seen in recent crises, private risk taking and debt are socialized when a crisis occurs.
So, even when public deficits and debt are low before a crisis, they can rise sharply after one erupts.
Governments that looked fiscally sound suddenly appear insolvent.
Using 200 quantitative variables and factors to score 174 countries on a quarterly basis, we have identified a number of countries where investors are missing risks – and opportunities.
China is a perfect example.
The country’s home developers, local governments, and state-owned enterprises are severely over-indebted.
China has the balance-sheet strength to bail them out, but the authorities would then face a choice: embrace reform or rely once again on leverage to stimulate the economy.
Even if China continues on the latter course, it will fail to achieve its growth targets and will look more fragile over time.
Brazil should have been downgraded below investment grade last year, as the economy struggled with a widening fiscal deficit, a growing economy-wide debt burden, and a weak and worsening business environment.
The corruption scandal at energy giant Petrobras is finally causing ratings agencies to reassess Brazil, but the move comes too late, and their downgrades probably will not be sufficient to reflect the true risk.
Other emerging markets also look fragile and at risk of an eventual downgrade.
In the eurozone, shadow ratings already signaled red flags in the late 2000s in Greece and the other countries of the periphery.
More recently, Ireland and Spain may deserve to be upgraded, following fiscal consolidation and reforms.
Greece, however, remains a basket case.
Even with substantial reform to improve its growth potential, Greece will never be able to repay its sovereign debt and needs substantial relief.
An assessment of sovereign risk that is systematic and data-driven could help to spot the risks that changing global headwinds imply.
To that extent, it provides exactly what the world needs now: an approach that removes the need to rely on the ad hoc and slow-moving approach of ratings agencies and the noisy and volatile signals coming from markets.
Financial Hypocrisy
This year marks the tenth anniversary of the East Asia crisis, which began in Thailand on July 2, 1997, and spread to Indonesia in October and to Korea in December.
Eventually, it became a global financial crisis, embroiling Russia and Latin American countries, such as Brazil, and unleashing forces that played out over the ensuing years: Argentina in 2001 may be counted as among its victims.
There were many other innocent victims, including countries that had not even engaged in the international capital flows that were at the root of the crisis.
Indeed, Laos was among the worst-affected countries.
Though every crisis eventually ends, no one knew at the time how broad, deep, and long the ensuing recessions and depressions would be.
It was the worst global crisis since the Great Depression.
As the World Bank’s chief economist and senior vice president, I was in the middle of the conflagration and the debates about its causes and the appropriate policy responses.
This summer and fall, I revisited many of the affected countries, including Malaysia, Laos, Thailand, and Indonesia.
It is heartwarming to see their recovery.
These countries are now growing at 5% or 6% or more – not quite as fast as in the days of the East Asia miracle, but far more rapidly than many thought possible in the aftermath of the crisis.
Many countries changed their policies, but in directions markedly different from the reforms that the IMF had urged.
The poor were among those who bore the biggest burden of the crisis, as wages plummeted and unemployment soared.
As countries emerged, many placed a new emphasis on “harmony,” in an effort to redress the growing divide between rich and poor, urban and rural.
They gave greater weight to investments in people, launching innovative initiatives to bring health care and access to finance to more of their citizens, and creating social funds to help develop local communities.
Looking back at the crisis a decade later, we can see more clearly how wrong the diagnosis, prescription, and prognosis of the IMF and United States Treasury were.
The fundamental problem was premature capital market liberalization.
It is therefore ironic to see the US Treasury Secretary once again pushing for capital market liberalization in India – one of the two major developing countries (along with China) to emerge unscathed from the 1997 crisis.
It is no accident that these countries that had not fully liberalized their capital markets have done so well.
Subsequent research by the IMF has confirmed what every serious study had shown: capital market liberalization brings instability, but not necessarily growth.
(India and China have, by the same token, been the fastest-growing economies.)
Of course, Wall Street (whose interests the US Treasury represents) profits from capital market liberalization: they make money as capital flows in, as it flows out, and in the restructuring that occurs in the resulting havoc.
In South Korea, the IMF urged the sale of the country’s banks to American investors, even though Koreans had managed their own economy impressively for four decades, with higher growth, more stability, and without the systemic scandals that have marked US financial markets with such frequency.
In some cases, US firms bought the banks, held on to them until Korea recovered, and then resold them, reaping billions in capital gains.
In its rush to have westerners buy the banks, the IMF forgot one detail: to ensure that South Korea could recapture at least a fraction of those gains through taxation.
Whether US investors had greater expertise in banking in emerging markets may be debatable; that they had greater expertise in tax avoidance is not.
The contrast between the IMF/US Treasury advice to East Asia and what has happened in the current sub-prime debacle is glaring.
East Asian countries were told to raise their interest rates, in some cases to 25%, 40%, or higher, causing a rash of defaults.
In the current crisis, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank cut interest rates.
Similarly, the countries caught up in the East Asia crisis were lectured on the need for greater transparency and better regulation.
But lack of transparency played a central role in this past summer’s credit crunch; toxic mortgages were sliced and diced, spread around the world, packaged with better products, and hidden away as collateral, so no one could be sure who was holding what.
And there is now a chorus of caution about new regulations, which supposedly might hamper financial markets (including their exploitation of uninformed borrowers, which lay at the root of the problem.)
Finally, despite all the warnings about moral hazard, Western banks have been partly bailed out of their bad investments.
Following the 1997 crisis, there was a consensus that fundamental reform of the global financial architecture were needed.
But, while the current system may lead to unnecessary instability, and impose huge costs on developing countries, it serves some interests well.
It is not surprising, then, that ten years later, there has been no fundamental reform.
Nor, therefore, is it surprising that the world is once again facing a period of global financial instability, with uncertain outcomes for the world’s economies.
A Banker’s Revolution
KUALA LUMPUR – Financial regulators are generally known for taking a measured and cautious approach to change.
But in the developing world, that reputation is being turned upside down.
In some of the world’s poorest countries, central bankers have proved willing to make bold decisions – embracing innovative approaches in their quest to broaden participation in the formal financial system, increase financial stability, and put their countries on the path to inclusive, sustainable economic growth.
Increasing financial inclusion requires fundamentally rethinking how a country’s financial system is structured and operates.
It also frequently necessitates the use of instruments outside of the central bankers’ traditional toolkit.
In Kenya, for instance, officials altered the regulatory framework to allow for the growth of mobile money.
In Malaysia, the central bank took a lead role in raising the public’s level of financial literacy.
And in the Philippines, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas helped double the number of access points where consumers could obtain financial services, supporting the opening of 517 micro-banking offices, many of them in municipalities with no traditional bank branches.
Likewise, in 2011, the Bank of Tanzania made a specific commitment to increase financial inclusion under the Alliance for Financial Inclusion’s Maya Declaration, a commitment by policymakers in the developing world to unlock the social and economic potential of the poor.
The result was dramatic and vastly exceeded expectations.
Tanzania reached its goal of providing 50% of its adult citizens with access to banking a year ahead of schedule, making the country a global leader in digital financial services.
As in neighboring Kenya, the game changer was the widespread adoption of mobile money.
“It may sound maverick,” said Benno Ndulu, the bank’s governor. “But we must let innovation run ahead of regulation.”
While East Africa is blazing the trail when it comes to electronic money, other parts of the world are adopting different innovative approaches.
Last year in Colombia, Congress passed a law creating a new type of financial institution called a Specialized Electronic Deposit and Payment Institution.
While not technically banks, these institutions are able to accept customer deposits and payments electronically through mobile phones or at licensed locations like a post office.
The effort is part of a larger national strategy, launched in 2014, to provide 76% of adults with financial access and 56% with active savings accounts by the end of 2016.
And in the Pacific region, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, and Vanuatu have banded together to create the Pacific Islands Regional Initiative (PIRI), which will enable every Pacific Island state, even those without a central bank, to share knowledge on improving access, quality, and usage of financial services in geographically challenging environments.
Each of these efforts started as a country-led initiative, born of particular challenges and designed to meet the specific needs of the local population.
But the accumulation of experience is proving invaluable.
As lessons are shared and successes provide inspiration for others, the impact is becoming exponential, with even the smallest countries demonstrating that they have a significant contribution to make.
Meanwhile, as central banks change how they operate, retail banks are responding with new ways of doing business.
Kenya’s Equity Bank has grown enormously by explicitly targeting the financially excluded; in just six years, it has expanded from a half-million customers to almost six million.
Telecommunication companies are also pioneering new services.
Tigo, for example, now serves more than 56 million customers in 14 countries in Latin America and Africa with products such as cross-border mobile payments and cashless services for sales agents.
As with any period of great change, it is not easy to see what lies ahead.
As Stephen Kehoe, Head of Global Financial Inclusion at Visa, recently noted, “The last seven years provide absolutely no indication of what the next seven years will be.”
What is clear, however, is that there still remains much to be done – and that the opportunities are nearly limitless.
Bringing the world’s two billion unbanked people out of the shadows and into the mainstream financial system will require new partnerships among regulators, the private sector, non-profits, regional bodies, and international organizations.
That may seem like a tall order, but filling it would help build a brighter future for everyone.
Financial Inclusion and Beyond
CAMBRIDGE – Because traditional financial services are not designed for small depositors and borrowers, several non-traditional models have been able to scale up rapidly in this untapped market.
But, without a strategic policy roadmap to guide further financial-technology (fintech) development, these new “connector” models will remain limited in terms of the services they can provide.
In Kenya, the success of M-Pesa, a mobile payments app, has been nothing short of transformational.
It took PayPal two NASDAQ listings and almost two decades operating in the world’s largest economy to reach 188 million active customers and $282 billion in annual payments.
Although M-Pesa has been operating for less than a decade in a much lower-income market, it had nearly 17 million active users conducting more than $50 billion in cashless transactions last year.
Similarly, bKash now dominates the payments system in Bangladesh to such a degree that “bKashing” has become common Bengali parlance, just as “Xeroxing,” “Hoovering,” and “Googling” are in English.
Other models, such as Microensure and Bima, have also gained ground, offering micro-insurance solutions in emerging countries.
Jan Dhan Yojana, a high-priority Indian federal-government program that provides access to the banking sector for the poor, has enabled 250 million new bank accounts to be opened in less than two years.
New fintech products will have to clear several hurdles to move beyond just improving access to financial services.
Services fostering financial-inclusion must deliver a high volume of low-value output, which means they often have to rely on partnerships to meet certain consumer demands.
Problems arise when these partners have their own constraints or different priorities.
For example, Microensure and Bima have made insurance solutions available to millions of people; but their services ultimately depend on independent insurers to allocate capital and underwrite insurance policies.
Likewise, while there are green shoots of insurance-industry growth in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, global insurers must constantly adapt to regulatory changes in their primary or home markets, and it is unclear if they have the capacity to expand meaningfully into low-income countries.
Or consider M-Pesa itself.
Four years ago, it formed a partnership with the Commercial Bank of Africa to add a lending tool, M-Shwari, to its suite of products.
It has since opened more loan accounts than any Kenyan bank.
But such accounts still number less than a quarter of active M-Pesa users, and M-Shwari still supports only small 30-day loans.
M-Shwari is not a core part of either partner’s business.
Nor is it the only product of its kind on the market.
The most recent competitor to challenge M-Pesa is mVisa, a partnership between Visa Inc. and two other Kenyan banks.
With $400 million in 2016 revenues at stake, Safaricom – M-Pesa’s parent company – will likely focus on defending its core offering before it tries to introduce new products.
In Safaricom’s current list of new product priorities to expand financial inclusion, saving-and-loan products are ranked almost last.
Unfettered innovation and entrepreneurship are necessary for connecting the poor to the formal financial system; but, from a policy and development perspective, we need to shift our efforts toward improving the larger ecosystem to realize new fintech products’ full potential.
For example, M-Pesa’s cashless transactions are underpinned by cash contributed by its customers, which is held in trust at any given time.
Interest income from these funds is currently disbursed through the M-Pesa Foundation.
With a carefully constructed system, this money could be put to even greater productive use.
India’s Jan Dhan Yojana program has mobilized an estimated $6 billion from newly acquired customers, which could be used to provide additional tailored products.
Emerging fintech services can take a lesson from the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, which was quick in leveraging its payments platform, Alipay.
After Alibaba launched its money market fund, Yu’e Bao, in June 2013, it began reinvesting its Alipay customers’ unproductive micro-deposits.
By the end of 2015, the Yu’e Bao fund manager was overseeing $165 billion in assets and had converted Alipay’s millions of small, financially unsophisticated savers into investors collecting respectable returns.
To develop its platform, Alibaba relied on big data to manage the fund’s unique liquidity dynamics; and it benefited from China’s unsettled regulatory framework, though this could change in the future.
The Chinese context may be unique; and, indeed, there are growing concerns about risks inherent in the Yu’e Bao model.
But regulators and fintech firms should take note of examples like Alipay to develop rational strategic possibilities for this emerging sector.
Most important, they should remember that access to finance is not an end in itself, but a means to improve one’s lot.
A recent Indian Express investigation revealed what can happen when access to financial services is provided in a vacuum.
The paper found several instances where officials at Indian public-sector banks were depositing one rupee into customer accounts without customers’ knowledge.
These officials were apparently under pressure to reduce the number of zero-balance accounts, all of which, it turns out, were related to the Jan Dhan Yojana program.
Similar chicanery, we now know, was a routine practice at the US bank Wells Fargo.
The difference is that customers at the bottom of the pyramid have few banking alternatives.
Financial-services access is a much needed start, but it must lead somewhere.
Banking on the Unbanked
TORONTO – In a sea of gloomy news, one bright headline appears on the horizon.
The World Bank’s latest figures on individuals’ bank accounts, to be released next spring, are expected to show that the number of people holding accounts at banks or other formal financial institutions has grown.
The last time the World Bank published its Global Findex report, in April 2015, an estimated 700 million adults, mainly in developing countries, had obtained access to financial services during the previous three years.
That amounted to an increase of more than 21% in the global number of “banked” individuals.
Because broader access to financial services helps to create a path out of poverty, any increase in this metric is a positive sign for human development.
But my organization won’t be declaring victory when the new report comes out.
No matter what the World Bank data show, universal financial inclusion for the world’s poorest remains a distant goal.
At the moment, some two billion adults remain excluded from formal financial services.
Excessive documentation requirements, high account fees, limited access to bank branches, and the perception that financial institutions are “only for the rich” are among the most persistent obstacles to overcome.
At the Mastercard Foundation, we are committed to helping to remove these barriers for the world’s poorest.
This month in Accra, Ghana, we convened the fifth annual Symposium on Financial Inclusion, bringing together hundreds of financial services providers, policymakers, academics, and development experts to examine how to broaden and deepen financial inclusion.
We have been hosting this global conference since 2013, and each year, a familiar concern emerges: financial institutions could do more to focus on the needs of their poorest clients.
Because banks often do not consider the behaviors and aspirations of poor customers, they do not always offer the products and services the poor need.
If the industry’s priorities changed, barriers to inclusion would fall.
Reversing this trend should be easier than it is.
After all, when people prosper, so do banks.
Poor people tend to save more money when they can access bank accounts or make mobile payments.
With savings comes increased overall prosperity.
Children do better in school when parents can easily pay fees.
Women become more empowered to start businesses.
Poor households can better cope with adverse shocks like crop failure, illness, or natural disaster.
The positive economic knock-on effects are obvious.
With bank accounts, budding entrepreneurs can establish their creditworthiness and tap responsible, formal lenders.
And with capital, small enterprises can grow into larger businesses, employing others, especially young people.
Technology has helped close the gap in recent years.
The success of digital payment platforms, such as the M-Pesa mobile app in Kenya, demonstrates how quickly vulnerable clients will take up and use inexpensive products and services if they are designed with users’ needs in mind.
Moreover, financial technology firms in Africa and Asia are finding innovative ways to analyze data generated by poor people’s activities, and using that data to design and deliver better banking services.
Non-traditional approaches are also emerging, such as reaching the unbanked poor via small, independent businesses that they already use and trust.
But much of the onus for inclusion will remain on financial institutions.
One argument I often hear is that the financial services sector is risk-averse.
Given banks’ fiduciary obligations to their customers, this is not an entirely bad trait.
Yet banks and other financial institutions should realize that risk protection is perfectly compatible with service to poor customers.
By ignoring poor people’s needs, financial institutions are overlooking a massive potential market.
To reach hundreds of millions of new clients, the world’s financial institutions need only walk a metaphorical mile in the shoes of a poor person. They would then see that no one should be excluded because of inaccurate, outdated, or unfair assumptions.
Today, more people than ever are benefiting from access to modern and responsible financial services.
No doubt, next year’s World Bank data will indicate even greater gains.
But to achieve a world where no one is excluded, the industry must place the needs of poor clients at the center of its business strategies.
Only then will the good news about financial inclusion become great.
Why Financial Markets Underestimate Risk
CAMBRIDGE – During most of 2017, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) has been at the lowest levels of the last decade.
Recently, the VIX dipped below nine, even lower than in March 2007, just before the subprime mortgage crisis nearly blew up the global financial system.
Investors, it seems, are once again failing to appreciate just how risky the world is.
Known colloquially as the “fear index,” the VIX measures financial markets’ sensitivity to uncertainty – that is, the perceived probability of large fluctuations in the stock market’s value – as conveyed by stock index option prices.
A low VIX signals a “risk-on” period, when investors “reach for yield,” exchanging US Treasury bills and other safe-haven securities for riskier assets like stocks, corporate bonds, real estate, and carry-trade currencies.
This is where we are today, despite the variety of actual risks facing the economy.
While each of those risks will probably remain low in a given month, the unusually large number of them implies a reasonably strong chance that at least one will materialize over the next few years.
The first major risk is the bursting of a stock-market bubble.
Major stock-market indices hit record highs in September, in the United States and elsewhere, and equity prices are high relative to benchmarks like earnings and dividends.
Robert Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio is now above 30 – a level previously reached only twice, at the peaks of 1929 and 2000, both of which were followed by stock-market crashes.
We also face the risk of a bursting bond-market bubble.
Former US Federal Reserve Board Chair Alan Greenspan recently suggested that the bond market is even more overvalued (or “irrationally exuberant”) than the stock market.
The market is accustomed to falling bond yields: both corporate and government bonds were on a downward trend from 1981 to 2016.
But interest rates can’t go much lower than they are today; in fact, they are expected to rise, particularly in the US, though the European Central Bank and other major central banks also appear to be entering a tightening cycle.
If, say, an increase in inflation generates expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates more aggressively, a stock- or bond-market crash might result.
Geopolitical risk is also high – indeed, it has rarely been higher than it is today, just as faith in the stabilizing influence of US global leadership has rarely been lower.
The most acute risk relates to North Korea’s advancing nuclear program, but there are also substantial risks in the Middle East and elsewhere.
These risks are being exacerbated by US President Donald Trump, who has made a number of foreign-policy missteps, from mishandling the North Korea crisis to threatening to abrogate the Iran nuclear agreement.
So far, the consequences of Trump’s wild rhetoric on the domestic front have been limited, because most of it has not been translated into legislation.
But on the international front, it could have disastrous implications.
Beyond Trump’s capriciousness is a broader crisis in US politics.
Though showdowns in the US Congress over the debt ceiling did not result in a government shutdown this month, US leaders have only kicked the can down the road to the end of the year, when the stakes could well be higher and the stalemate more intractable.
The US may even face a constitutional crisis, if Special Counsel Robert Mueller were to find, for example, evidence of illegal contact between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.
The last time the VIX was as low as it is today, in 2006 and early 2007, one could also draw up a lengthy list of potential crises.
Most obvious, housing prices in the United Kingdom and the US were at record highs relative to benchmarks like rent, raising the risk of a collapse.
Yet markets acted as if risk was low, driving down the VIX and US Treasury bill rates, and driving up prices of stocks, junk bonds, and emerging-market securities.
When the housing market did crash, it was regarded as a surprise.
The crash lay outside any standard probability distribution that could have been estimated from past data, analysts declared, and was therefore a black swan event, or a case of “Knightian uncertainty,” radical uncertainty, or unknown unknowns.
After all, the analysts argued, housing prices had never fallen in nominal terms before.
But, while nominal housing prices had not fallen in the US in the previous 70 years, they had fallen in Japan in the 1990s and in the US in the 1930s.
This was, therefore, not a case of Knightian uncertainty, but of classical uncertainty, in which the data set generating the probability distribution was unnecessarily limited to a few decades of domestic observations.
In this sense, it is the “black swan” term that fits best – indeed, better than those who use it realize.
Nineteenth-century British philosophers cited black swans as the quintessential example of a phenomenon whose occurrence could not be inferred from observed data.
But that, too, reflected a failure to consider data from enough countries or centuries.
(The black swan is an Australian species that had been identified by ornithologists in the eighteenth century.)
This type of failure to take a sufficiently broad view turns out to be a key reason why investors periodically underestimate risk.
The formulas for pricing options, for example, require a statistical estimate of the variance.
Likewise, the formula for pricing mortgage-backed securities requires a statistical estimate of the frequency distribution of defaults.
Analysts estimate these parameters by plugging in just the last few years of data for the given country.
Moreover, in the boom-bust cycle described by Hyman Minsky, a period of low volatility lulls investors into a false sense of security, leading them to become over-leveraged and ultimately producing a crash.
Perhaps investors will re-evaluate the risks affecting the economy today, and the VIX will adjust.
But, if history is any guide, this will not happen until the negative shock, whatever it is, actually hits.
Whistling Past the Geopolitical Graveyard
NEW YORK – With Emmanuel Macron’s defeat of the right-wing populist Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election, the European Union and the euro have dodged a bullet.
But geopolitical risks are continuing to proliferate.
The populist backlash against globalization in the West will not be stilled by Macron’s victory, and could still lead to protectionism, trade wars, and sharp restrictions to migration.
If the forces of disintegration take hold, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU could eventually lead to a breakup of the EU – Macron or no Macron.
At the same time, Russia has maintained its aggressive behavior in the Baltics, the Balkans, Ukraine, and Syria.
The Middle East still contains multiple near-failed states, such as Iraq, Yemen, Libya, and Lebanon.
And the Sunni-Shia proxy wars between Saudi Arabia and Iran show no sign of ending.
In Asia, US or North Korean brinkmanship could precipitate a military conflict on the Korean Peninsula.
And China is continuing to engage in – and in some cases escalating – its territorial disputes with regional neighbors.
Despite these geopolitical risks, global financial markets have reached new heights.
So it is worth asking if investors are underestimating the potential for one or more of these conflicts to trigger a more serious crisis, and what it would take to shock them out of their complacency if they are.
There are many explanations for why markets may be ignoring geopolitical risks.
For starters, even with much of the Middle East burning, there have been no oil-supply shocks or embargos, and the shale-gas revolution in the United States has increased the supply of low-cost energy.
During previous Middle East conflicts – such as the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979, and Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 – oil-supply shocks caused global stagflation and sharp stock-market corrections.
A second explanation is that investors are extrapolating from previous shocks, such as the attacks of September 11, 2001, when policymakers saved the day by backstopping the economy and financial markets with strong monetary and fiscal policy easing.
These policies turned post-shock market corrections into buying opportunities, because the fall in asset prices was reversed in a matter of days or weeks.
Third, the countries that actually have experienced localized asset-market shocks – such as Russia and Ukraine after Russia’s annexation of Crimea and incursion into Eastern Ukraine in 2014 – are not large enough economically to affect US or global financial markets.
Similarly, even as the UK pursues a “hard Brexit,” it still only accounts for around 2% of global GDP.
A fourth explanation is that the world has so far been spared from the tail risks associated with today’s geopolitical conflagrations.
There has not yet been a direct military conflict between any major powers, nor have the EU or eurozone collapsed.
US President Donald Trump’s more radical, populist policies have been partly contained.
And China’s economy has not yet suffered from a hard landing, which would create sociopolitical instability.
Moreover, markets have trouble pricing such “black swan” events: “unknown unknowns” that are unlikely, but extremely costly.
For example, the market couldn’t have predicted 9/11.
And even if investors think that another major terrorist attack will come, they cannot know when.
A confrontation between the US and North Korea could also turn into a black swan event, but this is a possibility that markets have happily ignored.
One reason is that, notwithstanding Trump’s bluster, the US has very few realistic military options: North Korea could use conventional weapons to wipe out Seoul and its surroundings, where almost half of South Korea’s population lives, were the US to strike.
Investors may be assuming that even if a limited military exchange occurred, it would not escalate into a full-fledged war, and policy loosening could soften the blow on the economy and financial markets.
In this scenario, as with 9/11, the initial market correction would end up being a buying opportunity.
But there are other possible scenarios, some of which could turn out to be black swans.
Given the risks associated with direct military action, the US is now alleged to be using cyber weapons to eliminate the North Korean nuclear threat against the US mainland.
This may explain why so many of North Korea’s missile tests have failed in recent months.
But how will North Korea react to being militarily decapitated?
One answer is that it could launch a cyber attack of its own.
North Korea’s cyber-warfare capabilities are considered to be just a notch below those of Russia and China, and the world got an early glimpse of them in 2014 when it hacked into Sony Pictures.
A major North Korean cyber attack could disable or destroy parts of the US’s critical infrastructure, and cause massive economic and financial damage.
That remains a risk even if the US can sabotage North Korea’s entire industrial system and infrastructure.
Or, faced with disruption of its missile program and regime, North Korea could go low-tech, by sending a ship with a dirty bomb into the ports of Los Angeles or New York.
An attack of this kind would most likely be very hard to monitor or stop.
So, while investors may be right to discount the risk of a conventional military conflict between the US and North Korea, they also may be underestimating the threat of a true black swan event, such as a disruptive cyberwar between the two countries or a dirty bomb attack against the US.
Would an escalation on the Korean Peninsula be an opportunity to “buy the dip,” or would it mark the beginning of a massive market meltdown?
It is well known that markets can price the “risks” associated with a normal distribution of events that can be statistically estimated and measured.
But they have more trouble grappling with “Knightian uncertainty”: risk that cannot be calculated in probabilistic terms.
A Hacker’s Market?
NEW YORK – Never in the history of written communication could 140 characters have the impact that they can have now.
Two weeks ago, after gaining access to the Associated Press’s main Twitter account (@AP), the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) posted a fake tweet reporting two explosions in the White House and the injury of President Barack Obama.
Within seconds, US financial markets dropped by about 1%.
Minutes later, Twitter was abuzz with refutations.
Reporters at the White House tweeted that they felt no explosion, and AP reporters and the AP Politics Twitter account announced that @AP had been hacked.
At his afternoon briefing, White House press secretary Jay Carney confirmed that Obama was indeed unharmed.
Financial markets returned to their pre-hoax level.
The @AP Twitter hoax represents systemic risk that cannot be eliminated, for it arises from the interaction of highly integrated financial markets and increasingly democratized news delivery.
Given strong incentives for malicious parties to perpetrate such hoaxes, we should expect to see an increase in incidents.
Financial markets are vulnerable to manipulation, because they are not in the business of evaluating the truth.
Trading often favors first movers, so being fast but wrong can still be profitable.
Imagine that a sophisticated trading firm has invested significant resources to develop an algorithm that quickly evaluates the potential market impact of news, and then automatically sends orders to trade based on that predicted impact.
When that algorithm parses a tweet from the AP containing important keywords (explosion, White House, and Obama), it will send orders to sell with the expectation that the market will drop as others – first, slower algorithms, then even slower humans – start to process the same news.
The first mover is happy to make such trades without verifying that the news is true.
If it is true, the market will stay down or continue dropping, and the first mover will profit from the sales that it has made.
If the story is a hoax, the market will probably return to its earlier, fairly valued level, and the first mover will break even on its sales, and possibly profit from any position purchased as a hedge when the market was down.
The first mover’s algorithm worked, regardless of the story’s veracity.
The likely losers in the @AP Twitter hoax were later movers who did not react quickly to the news, but reacted instead to the market’s movement.
These late movers were also likely to have been sophisticated electronic or institutional traders; some were probably using arbitrage-based strategies that relied on the futures market for a calculation of the fair price.
The market’s vulnerability to hoax stories is thus difficult to eliminate, for it is inherent in its structure.
It cannot be regulated away or fixed by technology or surveillance.
Even if markets moved more slowly, there would still be a first mover who responded before such a news story was revealed as a hoax.
This dynamic is similar to that of an asset bubble, albeit faster.
In a bubble, valuations are based on collectively evaluated evidence, and those who enter the market earliest often benefit.
Whether evaluating an assumption about the rise of house prices or whether a news story is true, the market does not provide a definitive answer instantaneously.
If protecting against hoaxes is not the market’s purview, can news agencies or new media entities like Twitter prevent such deception?
To be sure, they have suffered reputational damage from this fiasco and will likely try to improve.
But their efforts will not be enough.
Twitter’s vulnerabilities were technically understood before this event, and the service was already moving toward a more sophisticated authentication model (a password paired with a one-time key from a text message or other device).
Twitter will likely implement this soon.
It should also consider adding an optional “two-key” system, in which an independent signoff from a separate account is required before a proposed tweet is broadcast.
But, while such measures would increase the difficulty of hacking the system, no technological fix can make it impenetrable.
What about the AP’s vulnerabilities?
Attackers launched a “phishing” attempt against the AP’s emails shortly before the hoax tweet was sent.
Phishing attacks, in which an employee is duped into sending a password to a third party or clicking an untrusted link that installs malicious software, represent a hybrid of cultural and technological failures.
As attackers become more sophisticated, they send better-crafted emails, sometimes impersonating trusted sources that lure unwary users.
Crafting a culture of security is difficult and often at odds with the dynamic and decentralized work environment of a fast-moving newsroom.
As technologies change, so must awareness of vulnerabilities, and this awareness must be disseminated through means other than corporate memos that are disconnected from day-to-day business realities.
Empirically, few firms get this right: America’s National Public Radio and the BBC were both recently hacked by the SEA, while McDonald’s and Burger King recently had their Twitter accounts compromised.
The proliferation of security lapses means that people are more likely to shrug their shoulders than to cast the first stone at a company that is breached.
Finally, the AP is unlikely to face financial penalties for this mistake.
A lawsuit for losses stemming from the hoaxed tweet would face nearly insurmountable obstacles.
Because few mechanisms can prevent the proliferation of hoaxed tweets, and given the high-profile response that successful hackers can expect, Twitter will remain a vehicle of malicious hoaxes, even as technological barriers make attacks more challenging.
Indeed, the SEC recently approved the use of social media like Facebook and Twitter for publicly traded companies’ disclosures to investors.
Imagine what might happen if @BP_America tweets: “#Explosion reported at Gulf well.
Details to follow.”
The incentives to try to hack such accounts are obvious: not only significant publicity for hackers, but highly lucrative profit opportunities from the almost inevitable stock-market movements that will result.
On Twitter, as elsewhere, caveat emptor.
The Private Sector and the SDGs
WASHINGTON, DC – Achieving the ambitious global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – which include ending poverty, improving global health, ensuring universal education, and mitigating climate change by 2030 – will cost a lot of money.
The total will be far more than governments can make available, and the gap cannot be closed by official development assistance, now at $132 billion per year.
The private sector, as well as updated financial markets, will be essential.
Until recently, international organizations and governments had relatively well-defined roles in the global development and sustainability agenda, whereas the private sector’s participation in the process was often viewed through the lens of its contributions to economic growth, job creation, and tax revenue.
That must now change, with the private sector taking on a broader, more integrated role in the development agenda.
The private sector can become a financier, shifting trillions of dollars of capital toward developing economies.
And it can play an important role as an implementer, translating profits into sustained economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection.
The principles underpinning such measures are anchored in SDG target 12.6, which encourages “companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle.”
Financial and asset-management institutions can provide positive incentives to such companies – those that incorporate sustainability, long-term thinking, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance criteria in core business models – by allocating assets accordingly.
Such a move would go a long way toward promoting long-term progress on the SDGs.
Fortunately, many companies already fit this description.
A 2016 survey of CEOs, conducted by the United Nations Global Compact and Accenture showed that many business leaders already view solving “societal challenges as a core element in the search for competitive advantage.”
And almost half of all CEOs surveyed believe that “business will be the single most important actor in delivering the SDGs.”
According to a recent report published by Moody’s, interest in investments relating to climate change and sustainable development by institutional investors has grown rapidly in recent years.
Now, institutional investors with long histories of ESG investments, such as the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), are being joined by a growing number of their peers.
Some are even opting to divest from any company with exposure to industries or business practices that present sustainability challenges.
This trend toward sustainable investment will undoubtedly accelerate.
But, even without the agreement, the appeal of such investments stands: evidence indicates that integration of ESG considerations – when implemented intelligently and measured and reported transparently – could help investments outperform expectations, for both companies and investors.
Add to that financial-market incentives, and huge amounts of capital could be attracted to ESG investments.
Nonetheless, significant challenges remain, including uncertain performance expectations and evolving disclosure regimes.
Despite innovation in the financial products channeling ESG investment, the supply of ESG instruments, such as green bonds, remains insufficient.
Another challenge relates to data.
Good data on ESG investment are indispensable, as they enable investors and companies to determine whether their outlays in this area will promote or impede the achievement of the SDGs.
To this end, we need to develop a robust, transparent reporting framework that allows companies to report on financial and non-financial performance.
That framework must also support the private sector and investors in their effort to combine profit maximization with the pursuit of long-term economic, social, and environmental objectives.
Integrated corporate reporting and disclosure of material ESG information can facilitate the creation of an efficient financial system that advances sustainable economic growth, while supporting achievement of the SDGs.
The development of such an integrated reporting framework currently is being led by a few national and international organizations, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).
Their main objectives are to enable companies and organizations to set sustainability targets and key performance indicators; to monitor, prepare, and disclose comparative data measuring their economic and ESG performance; and to integrate sustainable production and consumption practices in company business strategies and models.
Global awareness of this topic is growing.
Recently, Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the G20’s Financial Stability Board, and Michael Bloomberg, a former New York City mayor and CEO of Bloomberg LP, issued an announcement regarding market data on climate.
Given the magnitude of the task, however, it is important also to ensure effective coordination and harmonization of these efforts with the relevant standard-setters, regulators, and professional organizations.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission, for one, is already discussing these issues, as it analyzes options to respond to investor and business needs regarding ESG.
New ESG reporting frameworks can help to attract billions of dollars from institutional investors to support the effort to achieve the SDGs.
But that is only one example of how the public and private sectors can work together to identify opportunities to advance the SDGs.
If we take advantage of these possibilities, public-private cooperation can enable millions of people to lift themselves out of poverty and help to build a more peaceful, prosperous, and secure world.
The Next Phase of Finance
WASHINGTON, DC – The decade since the global financial crisis has been tumultuous, to say the least.
True, no great war has erupted, and we have more or less avoided the mistakes of the Great Depression, which led in the 1930s to greater protectionism, bank failures, severe austerity, and a deflationary environment.
But renewed market tensions indicate that these risks have not been eradicated so much as papered over.
In a sense, the story of the 2008 financial crisis begins when the global order was created from the ashes of World War II.
Initiatives like the Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund), the Marshall Plan, and the European Economic Community supported the reconstruction of significant portions of the world economy.
Despite the Cold War (or perhaps because of it), they also re-started the globalization that WWII had brought to a halt.
This globalization process was interrupted during the late 1960s and early 1970s, owing to the Vietnam War, the suspension of the US dollar’s convertibility into gold, the 1973 oil price shock, and the great stagflation.
But the United States and the United Kingdom then underwent a kind of conservative revolution and a revival of neoliberal economic policies, including widespread deregulation, trade liberalization, and unprecedented capital-account openness.
While this redesigned globalization process helped to fuel growth and development, its effects were uneven, and the financial and economic changes it wrought outpaced legal and ethical adaptation.
Particularly consequential, innovative financial instruments were used with abandon, subject to only loose supervision and weak regulation.
As a result, finance eventually became the master of the world economy, rather than its servant.
Given all of this, when the crisis struck, it was deep and far-reaching, and today’s strengthening economic recovery has not overcome the understandable but devastating loss of trust in the financial system that followed.
This has been made apparent by political developments in the US and Europe.
US President Donald Trump’s administration continues to tout an “America First” policy approach, reflected, most recently, in the imposition of large tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
The United Kingdom’s vote for Brexit reflects a similar backlash.
Meanwhile, state-led capitalism offers China’s economy its own protections.
But polarizing new models of competition and resistance to trade are not the way to restore trust.
Instead, we need to reassert control over the financial sector, to ensure that it is serving the economy, not vice versa, by advancing a set of goals upon which the world agrees – beginning with those established at three momentous conferences in 2015.
At the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, participants set economic, social, and environmental priorities with which financing flows and policies for sustainable development should be aligned.
At the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in New York, UN member countries formally adopted an ambitious new global agenda.
And at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 21) in Paris, countries agreed to hold global warming well below 2° Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
Articulating these goals was an important first step.
But if the world is serious about achieving these shared goals, an effective mechanism for financing them must be established, supported by well-designed regulations that create the right incentives.
And, so far, the world has not made nearly enough progress on this front, as the continued misallocation of capital shows.
Stakeholders must take a longer-term view of business operations and investment strategies.
Finance must be made genuinely useful, balancing progress toward agreed goals – guided by existing global targets – with the need to generate sufficient financial returns to ensure that progress is sustainable.
We must keep saying it, and keep doing it.
There is no other option.
In some quarters, commitment to global goals has so far been too weak.
In the case of the US and the Paris climate agreement, that commitment has been rescinded outright.
But, to succeed, everyone must be on board.
This includes multilateral lenders, which need to revise old tools and rapidly develop new ones, in order to mobilize private-sector capital.
The private sector, for its part, must be open to an updated approach to public-private partnerships.
Simply paying lip service to change, while clinging to outdated modes of working, is not an option.
More broadly, we need to work to ensure that the benefits of technology are shared by all.
To that end, we should follow the advice of David Lipton, the IMF’s first deputy managing director, and move beyond the fashionable “OHIO” approach, focused on getting one’s “own house in order,” to the more demanding California – or “CA” – strategy of “collective action.”
The path ahead will not be easy.
But this is no excuse for apathy.
As investors, consumers, voters, and citizens, we must make our voices heard, in order to ensure that finance is used to promote shared values and the common good.
Only then can we go beyond merely avoiding another devastating crisis and build a better future.
Who’s Right on US Financial Reform?
CAMBRIDGE – Eight years after triggering a crisis that nearly brought down the global financial system, the United States remains plagued by confusion about what reforms are needed to prevent it from happening again.
As Americans prepare to choose their next president, a better understanding of the policy changes that would minimize the risk of future crises – and which politicians are most likely to implement them – is urgently needed.
What Americans are sure about is that they are angry with the financial sector.
This is reflected in the success of recent Hollywood movies such as The Big Short (which has been rightly praised for making complex instruments like derivatives broadly understandable).
And it is reflected in the current presidential campaign – most notably, in remarkable support for Senator Bernie Sanders’s leftist bid for the Democratic nomination.
At the center of Sanders’s campaign is a proposal to break up the big Wall Street banks into little pieces, thereby ensuring that no bank is so big that its failure would endanger the rest of the financial system.
The appeal of that goal is understandable.
But achieving it would require a massive sledgehammer.
Though the American banking system historically featured thousands of small banks, the “too big to fail” phenomenon is not exactly new.
The first bank that was declared “too big to fail” was Continental Illinois, which received a bailout in 1984 from President Ronald Reagan.
With banks now bigger than ever – America’s four largest each held more than $1 trillion in assets in 2011 – breaking them down to the point that no segment is systemically important would be a long and complex process, to say the least.
Merely turning the deregulatory clock back 30 years would not do the trick.
But even if Sanders did somehow manage to break up the banks sufficiently, it would not solve the problem.
After all, the US experienced a run on depositary institutions in the 1930s, when its financial system still comprised thousands of small banks.
Yet Canada, with a financial system dominated by just five large banks, sailed through the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 more easily than almost any other country.
Yet Sanders has indicated that he would even prohibit anyone with past experience on Wall Street from serving in his administration.
Such blanket statements and superficial judgments do not belong in the selection of individuals for important positions.
Consider Gary Gensler, a former co-head of finance at Goldman Sachs, whose appointment as Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Sanders tried (and failed) to block in 2009.
In that position, to the consternation of many former Wall Street colleagues, Gensler spent five years working vigorously to implement financial-reform legislation, including pursuing the aggressive regulation of derivatives.
Gensler also supported the prosecution of five financial institutions that had colluded to manipulate the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor, the benchmark rate that some major banks charge one another for short-term loans).
Attacking banks is emotionally satisfying.
But it won’t prevent financial crises.
In fact, the financial industry’s biggest problems lie elsewhere: hedge funds, investment banks, and other non-bank financial institutions that face less regulatory oversight and restrictions (such as on capital standards and leverage) than commercial banks.
Recall that Lehman Brothers was not a commercial bank, and AIG was an insurance company.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton – Sanders’s opponent for the Democratic nomination – recognizes the need to place a high priority on regulating non-banks, and she has proposed specific measures to do so.
For example, she is calling for a small tax targeting certain kinds of high-frequency trading prone to abuse.
Clinton also aims to close the “carried interest” loophole that currently allows hedge-fund managers to pay lower tax rates on their incomes than almost everyone else, and she proposes imposing a “risk fee” on big financial institutions that would rise as they grow.
Clinton’s proposed risk fee resembles one advanced by President Barack Obama’s administration in 2010 in order to discourage risky activity by the largest banks, while helping to recoup some revenue from bailouts.
But that plan was thwarted by three Republican senators who would support critical financial-reform legislation – the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act – only if the fee was dropped.
Even without the risk fee for large banks, the Dodd-Frank legislation was a step in the right direction.
Among other things, it increased transparency for derivatives, raised capital requirements for financial institutions, imposed additional regulations on “systemically important” institutions, and, per the suggestion of Senator Elizabeth Warren, established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
But Dodd-Frank was far from complete.
Making matters worse, many in Congress have spent the last six years chipping away at it, such as by exempting auto dealers from the CFPB and restricting the budgets of the regulatory agencies.
Those who worked to undermine the financial regulatory-reform legislation – mostly Republicans – appear to have paid no political price for it.
Meanwhile, those who, like Gensler, worked tirelessly to implement the reforms are judged according to superficial criteria by the very politicians who should support them.
There is a place in political campaigns for bumper-sticker slogans.
And there is definitely a place for ambitious goals.
But the danger is that those who are attracted to inspirational rallying cries and sweeping proposals will lack the patience required to identify which side to support in the numerous complex battles over financial regulation that take place every year.
To get the details of financial regulation right, the US needs leaders with the wisdom, experience, and perseverance to identify the right measures, push for their enactment, and then implement them effectively.
If such people are not the ones who receive political support, we should not be surprised if the financial sector again escapes effective regulation and crises recur.
Fighting the Next Global Financial Crisis
NEW HAVEN – What do people mean when they criticize generals for “fighting the last war”?
It’s not that generals ever think they will face the same weapon systems and the same battlefields.
They certainly know better.
The error, to the extent that the generals make it, must operate at a more subtle level.
Generals are sometimes slow to get around to developing plans and ordnance for those new weapon systems and battlefields.
And, just as important, they sometimes assume that the public psychology and narratives that influence their soldiers' morale are the same as in the last war.
That is also true for regulators whose job is to prevent financial crises.
For the same reasons, they may be slow to change in response to new situations.
They tend to adapt only gradually to changing public psychology.
The need for regulation depends on public perceptions of the last crisis, and, as George Akerlof and I argued in Animal Spirits, these perceptions depend heavily on changing popular narratives.
The latest progress reports from the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in Basel outline definite improvements in stability-enhancing financial regulations in 24 of the world’s largest economies.
Their “Dashboard” tabulates progress in 14 different regulatory areas.
For example, the FSB gives high marks for all 24 countries in implementing the Basel III risk-based capital requirements.
But the situation is not altogether reassuring.
These risk-based capital requirements may not be high enough, as Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig argued in their influential book The Bankers New Clothes.
And there has been much less progress in a dozen other regulatory areas that the FSB tabulates.
Consider, for example, regulations regarding money market funds, which, according to the FSB, only a few countries have developed since 2008.
Money market funds are an alternative to banks for storing one’s money, offering somewhat higher interest rates, but without the insurance that protects bank deposits in many countries.
As with bank deposits, investors can take their money out at any time.
And, like bank deposits, the funds are potentially subject to a run if a large number of people try to withdraw their money at the same time.
On September 16, 2008, a few days after the run on the US bank Washington Mutual began and the day after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy was announced, a major United States money market fund, Reserve Primary Fund, which had invested in Lehman debt, was in serious trouble.
With assets totaling less than it owed to investors, the fund seemed to be on the verge of a run.
As panic rose among the public, the federal government, fearing a major run on other money market funds, guaranteed all such funds for one year, starting September 19, 2008.
The reason why this run was so alarming as to require unprecedented government support stems from the narratives underlying it.
In fact, the Reserve Primary Fund did not lose everything.
It merely “broke the buck,” meaning that it couldn’t pay one dollar for a dollar on the books; but it could still pay $0.97.
So why a crisis?
After all, bank depositors regularly lose more when unexpected inflation erodes their savings’ real purchasing power (only the nominal value of those deposits is insured).
But the narratives don’t focus on that.
The loss of real value due to inflation hasn’t been a prominent theme of the public narrative in the US for decades, because sustained price stability has caused people to forget about it.
But they hadn’t forgotten about the Great Depression of the 1930s, even though most people alive today weren’t alive then.
In 2008, the Great Depression narrative was being recycled everywhere, with all its colorful stories of financial panic and angry crowds forming around closed banks.
Moreover, trusted authorities had seemed to say again and again that such events were historically remote and could not happen again.
In the 2008 angry zeitgeist, the public reaction to a relatively minor event took on stunning proportions.
It took almost six years after the crisis for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to reduce money market funds’ vulnerability, by requiring in 2014 a “floating NAV” (net asset value), which means that prime money market funds no longer promise to pay out a dollar for a dollar’s nominal value.
They will pay out whatever the depositor’s share in the accounts is.
This does not insure the funds’ investors against losses.
Yet this plausibly will help prevent runs because it means sudden withdrawals by some won’t damage the accounts of others who did not withdraw.
The international regulatory framework has changed for the better since 2008, but no such changes can anticipate all the kinds of change in narratives that underlie public animal spirits.
Regulators could have imposed a floating NAV decades ago; they didn’t because they didn’t foresee a narrative that would make money market funds unstable.
Regulatory authorities could not have been expected to predict the sudden public attention to the newly discovered risk of runs on nonbank financial companies.
As long as we have an economic system that produces growth by rewarding inspired actors and investors, we will face the risk that adverse talk and stories can suddenly and temporarily overwhelm the inspiration.
Regulators must counter the risks implied by structures that are intrinsically destabilizing, as the money market funds were.
But the most urgent regulations will always be time- and context-specific, because narratives change.
And how these narratives resonate with the public may once again reveal chinks in our financial armor.
Is Financial Repression Here to Stay?
LONDON – There are several definitions of financial repression – and the repressors and the repressed tend to see things differently.
But what financial repression usually involves is keeping interest rates below their natural market level, to the benefit of borrowers at the expense of savers.
The borrowers are often governments, and in many emerging economies the state has funded its extravagances by paying bank depositors derisory rates of interest.
But in the last seven years, since central banks in developed countries pushed down their base rates almost to zero, we have seen a First-World version of financial repression.
A recent research report from the insurer Swiss Re describes who has won and lost as a result, and questions the sustainability of the policies pursued by institutions such as the United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England.
The report’s argument is that while the stated motivation for ultra-loose monetary policy might be to guard against deflation and promote economic growth at a time when demand is weak, low interest rates also help governments fund their debt very cheaply.
Moreover, as we enter the eighth year of aggressive easing, unintended consequences are starting to appear – notably asset-price bubbles, increasing economic inequality (as wealthier investors able to hold equities benefit at the expense of small savers), and the risk of higher inflation in the future.
The jury may be out on the last point, but the first two are well established.
Many countries now have over-heated property and equity markets; in the US, the S&P 500 index since 2009 has closely tracked the expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet.
As a result, price-earnings (P/E) ratios, which reflect investors’ enthusiasm for equities, are now high by historical standards (Swiss Re has a Financial Market Excess index, which has returned to its 2007 level).
Moreover, according to the Swiss Re report, “monetary policy and central bank asset purchases have aggravated economic inequality via equity price inflation.”
The top 1% of US households have enjoyed a 50% gain in their financial wealth, while the bottom 90% have registered only a 12% profit.
The bottom 20% have probably not benefited at all.
Not surprisingly, central banks do not like this argument.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen insists that years of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing were not intended to make it easier for the US government to fund its deficit.
She argues that focusing on asset prices ignores the role – helpful for all income groups – of the Fed’s monetary policy in maintaining growth and thus warding off the threat of a wholesale depression.
But central banks accept that their policies have led to distortions in financial markets.
For example, institutional investors, especially insurance companies and pension funds, have suffered badly.
They are major holders of fixed-interest securities, and their investment income has fallen sharply.
The returns they can provide to investors and pensioners have similarly fallen.
Logically, therefore, individuals need to save much more to guarantee their income in retirement.
That in itself may have a depressing effect on the economy, partly offsetting the monetary stimulus.
Indeed, it may be one reason why highly expansionary policies by the Fed and other central banks have taken so long to generate growth.
A further distortion stems from the prudential regulation adopted in reaction to the global financial crisis.
The imposition of higher capital requirements on riskier investments has pushed financial institutions into holding government debt, which in turn means that they have less money available to lend for productive investment.
Most countries have yet to see investment recover to pre-crisis levels.
On this analysis, a return to “normal” interest rates cannot come soon enough.
The alternative is further financial repression and, with it, low investment, rising economic and social tensions, and the emergence of a generation of impoverished pensioners.
Like Monty Python’s city-terrorizing “Hell’s Grannies,” tomorrow’s elderly will surely make their voices heard.
But can we really expect the old normal – positive long-term interest rates on government bonds – to return?
Maybe it is unreasonable for investors to expect positive rates on safe assets in the future.
Perhaps we should expect to pay central banks and governments to keep our money safe, with positive returns offered only in return for some element of risk.
One reason is that investment may never reach its previous levels.
If a service-based economy simply has less need for expensive fixed capital, why should we expect a return to the days when business investment was a strong component of demand?
Apps are cheap.
Furthermore, excess savings could be more than just a cyclical phenomenon.
Individuals may have come to value future consumption, in retirement, over current consumption – the reverse of the traditional relationship.
We are beginning to appreciate that in our productive years we must work harder, because our retirement years will be longer and healthier, and the income support provided by our governments and employers will be far less generous than they used to be.
In other words, it is rational to save more now.
In the long run, such a brave new world might not be an intolerable place.
But the transition from here to there will be very challenging for financial firms, be they banks, asset managers or, particularly, insurers.
The types of products that the latter offer to their customers will need to change, and the mix of assets in which they invest will be different, too.
The question for regulators is whether, in responding to the financial crisis, they have created perverse incentives that are working against a recovery in long-term private-sector investment.
The Financial Sector’s Climate Imperative
PARIS – In the decade since the global financial crisis, mechanisms to boost the financial system’s resilience have been widely discussed.
But while some progress has been made, the largely piecemeal approach that has been pursued may yet prove inadequate to support long-term financial stability.
And a waning bull market means that the day of reckoning may not be far off.
It is impossible to say when the next crisis will erupt, let alone how long it will last or how damaging it will be.
But there is no doubt that the risks we face merit a more holistic approach, much like what was called for immediately after the 2008 crisis (though those calls lost steam as markets recovered).
This means agreeing on and implementing a new vision for governing the global economy; assessing it rigorously and adjusting it as needed; and ensuring full accountability for every stakeholder.
This vision must comprehend profound and ongoing changes, from increasingly concentrated market power to increasingly automated decision-making.
It must also consider China’s rise, which demands that China be incorporated more fully into governance bodies, which will have far-reaching implications, especially as the country emerges as a less benevolent global actor.
Furthermore, this vision must contend with rising nationalism and isolationism, exemplified by US President Donald Trump’s “America First” approach and his trade war with China.
And it must recognize that the effectiveness of macroeconomic tools – both monetary and fiscal – is more limited today than in 2008.
Finally, this new vision must reflect a clear decision about the extent to which we are committed to addressing climate and sustainability challenges.
Despite the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which changed the paradigm in which we talk about climate change, world leaders have remained reluctant to do what is needed to make a real difference.
We cannot continue to deceive ourselves by touting lofty goals while working only at the margins.
If we are serious about building resilience, we need to press ahead with tough systemic changes that address how we produce and consume energy and finance our economies.
This will require effective leadership. But, while collaboration among governments has helped drive some climate action, growing fragmentation within the international community has made the limits of this approach clear.
A more effective strategy may be to establish a coalition of civil societies and major financial and non-financial institutions to lead progress toward shared goals.
Such progress will demand, among other things, vastly improved accounting and reporting, together with smart regulatory reforms.
Moreover, it will require that market participants put in place appropriate incentives and mandates to consider sustainability and climate action in decision-making.
These can – and, in some cases, already do – include adjusted bonus schemes for managers, relevant monitoring requirements, and environmental labeling on consumer packaging.
Reputational factors, and even the soft-power influence of local governments, which are increasingly concerned with environmental risk, can also play a role in motivating companies to pursue a green transformation.
The financial sector, in particular, lacks the right incentives to contribute to addressing the climate challenge, because financial institutions’ decision-making is guided primarily – even exclusively – by monetary profit-seeking.
This is short-sighted and untenable.
Financial institutions need new incentives to reshape their operations, including their investments.
For example, portfolio managers could have their bonuses partly tied to their investments’ performance on climate metrics.
These changes need not undermine economic growth.
On the contrary, many climate solutions – such as the shift toward renewable energy – help to generate jobs, and can even increase corporate profitability.
In fact, replacing outdated and polluting infrastructure with modern and efficient alternatives represents one of the key investment opportunities of the century.
But this is about much more than profits.
As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in its recent report, the world’s current trajectory is leading to environmental devastation.
Already, natural disasters are becoming more frequent and intense.
As extreme weather events continue to multiply, large-scale destruction, migration, and conflict will become endemic.
We are at a pivotal moment in history, and we will need to muster the bravery and conviction needed to undertake strong action.
We must not only implement solutions, but also test and refine them regularly – not after a decade – guided by clear, evidence-based objectives and measures.
Only then can we ensure that not just our financial systems, but all of the structures that underpin global stability are sufficiently resilient.
To paraphrase Winston Churchill, we are faced with a choice between destruction and the status quo.
If we choose the latter, we will have the former.
The Quiet Financial Revolution Begins
LAGUNA BEACH – Steadily and indisputably, the financial services industry – with which we all interact, whether as borrowers, savers, investors, or regulators – has embarked on a multiyear transformation.
This process, slow at first, has been driven by the combined impact of two sets of durable forces.
On one hand, top-down factors – regulatory change, unusual pricing, and what Nouriel Roubini has cleverly termed the “liquidity paradox” – are at work.
Then there are disruptive influences that percolate up from below: changing customer preferences and, even more important, outside visionaries seeking to transform and modernize the industry.
Beginning at the top, the regulatory pendulum is still swinging toward tighter supervision of traditional financial institutions, particularly large banks and insurance companies deemed “systemically important.”
Moreover, re-designed regulatory frameworks, phased implementation, and stepped-up supervision will gradually extend to other segments, including asset management.
This will contribute to further generalized de-risking within the regulated sectors, as part of a broader financial-sector movement toward a “utilities model” that emphasizes larger capital cushions, less leverage, greater disclosure, stricter operational guidelines, and a lot more oversight.
The pricing environment compounds the impact of tighter regulation.
Like utilities, established financial institutions are facing external constraints on their pricing power, though not of the traditional form.
Rather than being subjected to explicit price regulations and guidelines, these institutions operate in a “financial repression” regime in which key benchmark interest rates have been held at levels below what would otherwise prevail.
This erodes net interest margins, puts pressure on certain fee structures, and makes certain providers more cautious about entering into long-term financial relationships.
As a result of these two factors, established institutions – particularly the large banks – will be inclined to do fewer things for fewer people, despite being flush with liquidity provided by central banks (the “liquidity paradox”).
And banks and broker-dealers can be expected to provide only limited liquidity to their clients if a large number of them suddenly seek to realign their financial positioning at the same time.
But this is not just about them.
The fact is that providers of all long-term financial products, particularly life insurance and pensions, have no choice these days but to streamline their offerings, including a reduction of those that still provide longer-term guarantees to clients looking for greater financial security.
The impact on the financial-services industry of these top-down factors will gradually amplify the importance of the bottom-up forces.
Over time, this second set of factors will fuel more direct and efficient provision of services to a broader set of consumers, contributing to a reconfiguration of the industry as a whole.
For starters, customer expectations will evolve as the millennial generation increasingly accounts for a larger portion of earning, spending, borrowing, saving, and investing.
With many of these newer clients favoring “self-directed” lives, providers of financial services will be pressed to switch from a product-push mindset to offering more holistic solutions that allow for greater individual customization.
Market-communication functions will also be forced to modernize as more clients expect more credible and substantive “any place, any time, and any way” interactions.
Then there is the influence of outside disruptors.
Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, expressed it well in his 2015 shareholder letter, observing that “Silicon Valley” is coming.
These new entrants want to apply more advanced technological solutions and insights from behavioral science to an industry that is profitable but has tended to under-serve its clients.
Airbnb and Uber have demonstrated that disruption from another industry is particularly powerful, because it involves enabling efficiency-enhancing structural changes that draw on core competencies and strategies that the incumbent firms lack.
Many other companies (for example, Rent the Runway, which provides short-term rentals of higher-end fashion) are in the process of doing the same thing.
Be it peer-to-peer platforms or crowd-funding, outside disruptors already are having an impact at the margin of finance, particularly in serving those who were previously marginalized by traditional firms or had lost trust in them.
The end result will be an industry that serves people via a larger menu of customizable solutions.
Though traditional firms will seek to adjust to maintain their dominance, many will be challenged to “self-disrupt” their thinking and operational approach.
And, while emerging firms will offer better services, they will not find it easy to overcome immediately and decisively the institutional and regulatory inertia that anchors traditional firms’ market position.
As a result, a proliferation of financial providers is likely, with particularly bright prospects for institutional partnerships that combine the more agile existing platforms with exciting new content and approaches.
Failure at the Financial Stability Board
WASHINGTON, DC – At least since the fall of 2008, leading economies’ officials have agreed – in principle – that something must be done about financial firms that are “too big to fail.”
Great efforts, including countless international meetings, working papers, and communiqués have been devoted to this end.
Earlier this month, the Basel-based Financial Stability Board (FSB) announced, to some fanfare, the completion of a major stage in this project.
But the announcement only served to underscore how little progress has been made.
The world’s largest banks remain too big to fail, and this is likely to have dire consequences in the near future.
The problem of too big to fail is not new – the phrase was first used in the United States in the 1980s.
It refers to any firm – usually in the financial sector – whose failure would have major negative spillover effects for the rest of the financial system and for the real (non-financial) part of the economy.
Prior to September 2008, there was some doubt as to whether large non-bank financial firms would be regarded as too big to fail.
Bear Stearns came close to failing earlier that year, before the Federal Reserve stepped in to facilitate a purchase by JPMorgan Chase.
Bear Stearns’ shareholders did not do well and much of its management immediately left the scene, but creditors were fully protected (in fact, ensuring this protection was a central motivation for the Fed’s intervention).
When Lehman Brothers came under severe pressure in September 2008, uncertainty reigned in financial markets (and at the top of Lehman): perhaps the Fed would help out again in some fashion.
By all accounts, the US Treasury and the Fed did indeed consider providing assistance, but then held back, worried about overstepping their legal authority and sufficiently confident that permitting Lehman to fail would not have dire consequences for the broader economy.
The second view proved to be spectacularly wrong.
Within 24 hours of Lehman’s failure, the US authorities were scrambling to prevent asset fire sales, a run on money market mutual funds, the collapse of other investment banks (such as Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs), and even the demise of large, integrated, global banks (such as Citigroup).
While deploying an unprecedented amount of financial firefighting equipment, officials and lawmakers – on both sides of the Atlantic – were clear that this was a “never again” situation.
As soon as the fires were out, they pledged, they would work diligently to ensure that the “next Lehman” could fail in a government-managed “resolution” process that would not cause panic and a collapse of credit.
This task was taken up at the international level by the FSB, established after the G-20 summit in London in April 2009.
After many years of working closely with leading national authorities (including in the US and Europe), on November 9 the FSB published “Removing Remaining Obstacles to Resolvability,” along with a number of related technical papers.
Unfortunately, there are three flaws in the FSB’s framework that will prevent it from being effectively applied to large global banks.
First, by definition, global banks operate across borders, and there is no agreement among different national authorities regarding how to respond in a crisis.
There is, arguably, better communication than there was before 2008, but when the chips are down, this will be worth little.
The countries involved have different legal rules, different procedures for protecting local assets, and different court systems.
A major international treaty could address all of this, but the immediate prospects for one are nonexistent.
Second, the FSB proposes to require a Total Loss Absorbing Capacity for all large banks.
But TLAC is just jargon for saying that these banks should fund themselves with both equity and “bail-in-able debt” – debt that can be converted to equity (or wiped out) when there is an official resolution event.
All this really means is that some debt can fall dramatically in value when government officials pull the trigger.
This may seem elegant in theory, but it is completely unworkable in practice.
In any real crisis, the authorities’ real fear is that the fall in one asset price (the equity value of big banks) will cause other asset-price declines – leading to a broader contraction of credit.
The idea of “loss-absorbing debt” is an oxymoron.
Third, what really matters for financial systems is the extent of equity financing – including how much equity banks are required to have.
Current levels are so low – debt funds around 95% of total credit exposure in most big US banks (and a slightly higher share in big European banks) – that banks’ equity can be substantially wiped out by even moderate negative shocks.
The good news is that the Fed increasingly seems to be taking this point on board – and inching toward higher capital requirements for the biggest banks.
Unfortunately, the failure of the international FSB approach means that the Fed must largely go it alone.
The Spider of Finance
LONDON – The global system of financial regulation is extraordinarily complex.
Partly for that reason, it is little understood.
In order to explain it to my students at Sciences Po in Paris, I have devised a kind of wiring diagram that shows the connections among the different bodies responsible for the various components of oversight.
It makes a circuit board look straightforward.
Many people show some spark of recognition at the mention of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which sets capital standards for banks.
They may also have heard of the Bank for International Settlements, the central banks’ central bank, in which the Basel Committee sits.
And the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which sets standards for exchanges and securities regulators, has name recognition in some quarters.
But when you get to the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, brows furrow.
There are many other groupings.
The International Accounting Standards Board does roughly what you might expect, though the Americans, while members, do not in fact use its standards – which are now confusingly called International Financial Reporting Standards.
But the IASB has spawned other committees to oversee auditing.
There is even – reminiscent of Hermann Hesse’s last novel, The Glass Bead Game – an international body that audits the bodies that audit the auditors.
The Financial Action Task Force sounds dynamic, like a rapid-response team one might send to a troubled country.
In fact, it is the part of the OECD that monitors the implementation of anti-money-laundering standards.
Why it is part of the OECD when its remit is global is a mystery few can explain.
This elaborate architecture (and there is a lot more) was assembled piecemeal in the 1980s and 1990s.
Until the Asian financial crisis, it was a web without a spider at its center.
When Hans Tietmeyer, a former head of the Bundesbank, was asked by G-7 finance ministers to review its effectiveness, he recommended a new spider, known as the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), which would examine the financial system as a whole and try to identify vulnerabilities that might cause future trouble.
I was a member of the FSF for five years.
I confess that I am rather afraid of spiders, but even an arachnophobe like me found little reason to be worried.
The FSF was not a scary creature, and the individual regulators, national and international, were largely left to their own devices, with all of the unhappy consequences with which we have become acquainted.
Before 2007, there was little political interest in tougher global standards, and individual countries resisted the idea that an international body might interfere in their sovereign right to oversee an unsound banking system.
So when the next crisis hit, the FSF was found wanting, and in 2009 the G-20 governments decided that a tougher model was needed – the Financial Stability Board.
The FSB has now been in operation for five years, and is currently working on some new proposals to deal with too-big-to-fail banks, which will be on the menu of the forthcoming G-20 meeting in Brisbane (along with surf and turf, Pavlovas, and other Australian delicacies).
There is not (yet) an international group that audits the FSB’s effectiveness.
But if there were, what would it say about the FSB’s performance so far, under the leadership of Mario Draghi and then of Mark Carney, each of whom did the job in his spare time, while running important central banks?
On the asset side of the balance sheet, the auditors would be bound to note that the Board has done much useful work.
Its regular reports to the G-20 pull together the diverse strands of regulation in a clear and comprehensible way.
There is no better source of information.
They would also record that pressure from the FSB has accelerated the work of sectoral regulators.
The second Basel accord took more than a decade to conclude; Basel 3 was drawn up in little more than 24 months (though implementation is taking quite long).
The performance of the IOSCO and the IAIS has similarly been sharpened by the need to report progress through the FSB.
The Board has also issued some valuable warnings in its so-called “vulnerabilities” assessments.
It has pointed to emerging tensions in the system, without falling into the trap of forecasting ten of the next three crises.
And its peer review mechanism is prodding individual countries to strengthen their regulatory institutions.
Nonetheless, a frank assessment would acknowledge that this spider has so far caught few flies.
To switch animal metaphors, it is a watchdog without teeth.
It can neither instruct the other regulators what to do (or not do) nor force member countries to comply with new regulations.
Indeed, the entire edifice of global financial regulation is built on a “best endeavors” basis.
The FSB’s charter, revised in 2012, says that signatories are subject to no legal obligations whatsoever.
Unlike the World Trade Organization, for example, no international treaty underpins the FSB, which means that countries cannot be sanctioned for failing to implement the standards to which they are ostensibly committed.
So a fair verdict would be that the FSB has done no more and no less than what its political masters have been prepared to allow it to do.
There is no political will to create a body that could genuinely police international standards and prevent countries from engaging in competitive deregulation – and prevent banks from engaging in regulatory arbitrage.
It seems that we must await the next crisis for that resolve to emerge.
In the meantime, the FSB, with all of its weaknesses, is the best we have.
The Debtor Prisoner’s Dilemma
PRINCETON – Any economic slowdown increases debt burdens, whether for households or for states.
Today, both are looking for ways to reduce the weight of debt – and some would prefer to escape it.
Deeply frustrated and angry people – especially in southern Europe – frequently hold up Argentina’s defiance of the international community in 2001 as a model.
Argentina then used a mixture of coercion and negotiation to get out from under the mountain of debt that it incurred in the 1990’s, effectively expropriating foreign creditors, who were viewed as dangerous and malign.
In the 1990’s, Argentina tied its hands with a dollar-pegged currency in order to enhance its credibility as a borrower.
The strategy worked too well: the large credit inflows that it attracted triggered an inflationary boom that reduced the country’s competitiveness.
By 2001, a combination of devaluation (exit from the currency straitjacket) and partial default was inevitable.
Default was followed by nominally voluntary restructurings in which creditors were invited to take some losses.
Up to now, the Argentine model has seemed successful, yielding substantial economic growth for the country since 2001.
That is what has made the model so appealing to debt-burdened southern Europeans.
But a recent New York court ruling against Argentina in a case brought by a holdout hedge-fund creditor has dramatically raised the stakes of sovereign default and bankruptcy.
When holdouts are rewarded by court decisions, and the rights of recalcitrant creditors are recognized in other jurisdictions, efforts at “voluntary” restructuring become unsustainable.
More and more parties will resist writing down some debt in favor of trying to seize whatever assets they can.
For Argentina, the writing is now on the wall.
One of the creditors favored in the New York case, Elliott Capital, had already successfully requested the seizure in Ghana of the Argentine Navy’s three-mast sailing ship ARA Libertad.
If the fallout of the New York decision is an extensive Argentine default on other obligations, foreign trade will become practically impossible, many goods will become scarce, and domestic inflation will increase further.
In short, the Argentine model of debt reduction in the 2000’s has collapsed as completely as its borrowing model in the 1990’s did.
Two fundamental facts have created an apparently insoluble dilemma for the global economy, and have turned countries like Argentina and Greece into victims of an impossible logic.
First, debt continually grows; second, there is no really satisfactory way of getting rid of it.
The financial sector’s explosive growth over the past two decades has fueled the accumulation of exceptionally large volumes of debt.
In the absence of some positive shock – such as an acceleration of GDP growth – servicing that debt becomes impossible for at least some borrowers.
Real debt defaults are historically rare.
For both borrowers and creditors, the risks and costs are enormous.
The borrower is cut off from international markets, and essential imports can no longer be purchased, while large-scale defaults threaten to plunge creditors into insolvency.
The consequence is a complicated game – currently exemplified by the saga of Greek voluntary restructuring – in which both sides stare into the abyss and then turn away from the out-and-out conflict that would send them plummeting into it.
Latin America experienced this dilemma in the 1980’s, when its debt arithmetic had become unsustainable.
At the outset of that crisis, major US financial institutions’ capital exposure to Latin America was near 200%, making candid recognition of debt unsustainability the surest route to wiping out the global financial system.
Most of the big Latin American debtors took extraordinary pains to avoid an explicit default.
The only sustained exception was Peru, which defaulted in 1985 and became an international pariah.
Of the largest borrowers, only Brazil, in 1987, formally defaulted – and only briefly.
As President José Sarney, backing down, admitted, “The fact is that we cannot destroy the international system.
We can scratch it, but it can destroy us.”
Instead, banks in the 1980’s offered new money in an attempt to extricate themselves from the crisis.
Managing modern debt crises always involves the extraordinary logic of throwing good money after bad in the hope of masking the underlying unsustainability.
The same logic has been applied in the euro crisis, with official money taking the place of private-sector exposure.
The emergence of inextinguishable debt replicates other troubling aspects of contemporary life.
Governments, businesses, and individuals all face the build-up of other sorts of liabilities in the form of accumulations of information that cannot be deleted.
E-mail, Facebook, and Twitter accounts all produce a permanent record that perpetually accompanies users, even when their circumstances change.
The legacy of the past continually resurfaces to constrain action in the present.
Just as countries might want to wipe out their debt and start anew, individuals might like to erase their electronic past in a dramatic act of liberation.
But that would destroy the useful together with the embarrassing or irrelevant.
If a clean start is impossible, the best that can be done is to try to bury the old information with such an inflationary flood of new data that it simply dwindles into insignificance.
The analogue in the world of debt negotiation is that a new start that allows borrowing to begin all over again is also impossible.
A cleanup is impossible. That leaves only one solution: pile on new claims to such an extent that old debts appear paltry.
Those who cannot forget the past are condemned to inflate it.
The Harm of Regulatory Disharmony
LONDON – In the alphabet soup of institutions involved in the regulation of global financial markets, the FMLC – the Financial Markets Law Committee – is not very prominent.
Given that it is based only in London, having grown out of an initiative by the Bank of England 20 years ago, and that most of its members are lawyers, most banks have not even heard of it (though some of them are represented on its Council).
But the services provided by the FMLC have never been more necessary.
The FMLC’s mission is to identify and propose solutions to issues of legal uncertainty in financial markets that might create risks in the future.
As a recent FMLC paper showed, the wave of new regulations implemented since the global financial crisis – many of which were poorly planned or inconsistent across countries – has left a jumbled landscape of legal uncertainties.
Consider banks’ capital requirements.
The Basel 3 Accord, adherence to which increased the liquidity of all banks and decreased their leverage, is viewed as a firm standard in some parts of the world.
But, in others, it is regarded as a minimum to which additional rules may be added.
Such “super-equivalence” or, more colloquially, “gold-plating” creates inconsistencies across jurisdictions, thereby facilitating regulatory arbitrage.
Likewise, the European Union, in contrast to the United States, regards the leverage ratio as a supervisory optional extra, known as a “Pillar 2 measure” (which permits supervisors to add additional capital buffers to address a particular bank’s idiosyncratic risks).
And, though both the US and the EU prohibit proprietary trading, they each define it differently.
There are also inconsistencies between the US and the EU in derivatives-market reform, which the Financial Stability Board has warned could undermine the objectives, set out by the G-20, of greater standardization of contracts and enhanced transparency.
And, whereas the Basel standards continue to refer extensively to credit ratings as the basis for assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers, the Dodd-Frank Act in the US moves away from reliance on ratings.
Such differences – and the FMLC Council lists many more – reflect a dangerous shift in the world’s approach to regulation.
The early post-crisis enthusiasm for new, globally agreed regulatory standards has given way to a range of national initiatives, driven by domestic political agendas, with little regard for cross-border compatibility.
More problematic, the peer-review procedures that have been introduced so far will do little, if anything, to resolve the problem.
Nor do the memoranda of understanding drawn up by national financial regulators offer hope of salvation.
According to the FMLC paper, “they are usually the subject of interpretative disagreement, are not legally binding, do not benefit from any binding dispute-resolution mechanisms, and do not prevent national authorities from acting unilaterally.”
So what can be done?
The FMLC makes four important recommendations.
First, the Financial Stability Board should help to reduce avoidable inconsistencies across countries by propagating a set of high-level principles to which all member countries would be expected to conform when introducing new regulations.
Indeed, the need for such principles should have been recognized in 2009, when the wave of re-regulation began.
Second, to address existing regulatory conflicts, the FMLC recommends establishing a “conflict of regulation” framework to determine which legal regime – that of a global firm’s home country or that of its local subsidiary’s host country – has jurisdiction in a specific cross-border dispute.
The alternative of relying on a third-party multilateral organization to act as mediator in such disputes, the report explains, has little support from G-20 countries.
Third, the FMLC proposes expanding the Financial Stability Board’s mandate.
That body, which emerged from the old Financial Stability Forum in 2009 with few powers and no formal status, has only recently become a separate legal entity.
Strengthening its powers – to include, for example, the establishment of principles for addressing cross-border legal inconsistencies – could go a long way toward addressing the problems raised by regulatory disparities.
Finally, the FMLC calls for the establishment of a permanent G-20 secretariat to improve continuity and coordination across G-20 presidencies.
As it stands, political priorities are constantly in flux, with individual dossiers losing their centrality, and even vanishing, from year to year.
Regulatory uncertainty may not seem like the most exciting topic, which is probably why the FMLC report has attracted so little attention.
But, as the 2008 global financial crisis starkly demonstrated, it can render markets dysfunctional, with ambiguity about different regulators’ responsibilities making it difficult, even impossible, to address the problems caused by failing firms.
(Former US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner’s crisis memoir makes that point painfully clear.)
When I chaired the United Kingdom’s regulatory body, the Financial Services Authority, I believed in the idea that lawyers should be on tap, not on top.
But they should always be heard.
The FMLC’s influential lawyers have spoken.
The world should listen.
How Healthy Is the Global Financial System?
LONDON – In recent weeks, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic have affirmed that the financial system is sound and stable.
The US Federal Reserve announced in June that all US banks passed its latest annual stress test.
And Fed Chair Janet Yellen has now suggested that we might not experience another financial crisis “in our lifetimes.”
At the same time, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) – which monitors regulatory practices around the world to ensure that they meet globally-agreed standards – has declared, in a letter to G20 leaders, that “toxic forms of shadow banking” are being eliminated.
In short, ongoing measures to buttress the global financial system have undoubtedly paid off, especially when it comes to strengthening capital cushions and cleaning up balance sheets in important parts of the banking system.
The latest assurances from policymakers are comforting to those of us who worry that not enough has been done to reduce systemic financial risk and to ensure that banks serve the real economy, rather than threaten its wellbeing.
Yet it is too soon to give the financial system as a whole a clean bill of health.
Efforts to shore up the banking sector in some parts of Europe are still lagging far behind.
And, more important, financial risks have continued to migrate to non-bank activities.
After irresponsible risk-taking almost tipped the global economy into a multi-year depression in 2007-2008, regulators and central banks in advanced economies launched a major effort to strengthen their financial systems.
To that end, they focused initially on banks, which have since bolstered their risk-absorbing capital cushions, cleansed murky balance sheets, increased liquidity, enhanced transparency, narrowed the scope of high-risk activities, and partly realigned internal incentives to discourage reckless behavior.
Moreover, the process for resolving failing and failed banks has been improved.
In addition to strengthening the banking sector, policymakers have also made progress toward standardizing derivative markets and making them more robust and transparent, which also reduces the risk of future taxpayer bailouts for irresponsible institutions.
Moreover, the system for payments and settlement has been made safer, thereby lowering the threat of a “sudden stop” in economic activity, like the one that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008.
It has been encouraging to watch national authorities coordinate their efforts under the auspices of the FSB.
Better coordination has reduced the risk of regulatory arbitrage, and address the threat that banks will be, as former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King memorably put it, “international in life but national in death.”
The United States and the United Kingdom took the lead on reform, and Europe has been catching up.
Assuming that it does, as policymakers there intend, Yellen’s assurance of a “much stronger” banking system in the US will apply to all of the other systemically important banking jurisdictions in the developed world, too.
And the FSB’s confident assertion that “reforms have addressed the fault lines that caused the global financial crisis” will receive more support.
Still, it is too early to declare victory.
Although the FSB describes the financial system as “safer, simpler and fairer,” it also acknowledges “nascent risks that, if left unchecked, could undermine the G20’s objective for strong, sustainable and balanced growth.”
As an observer and participant in global capital markets, three of these risks stand out to me.
First, as more carefully regulated banks have ceased certain activities, voluntarily or otherwise, they have been replaced by non-banks that are not subject to the same supervisory and regulatory standards.
Second, certain segments of the non-bank system are now in the grips of a “liquidity delusion,” in which some products risk over-promising the liquidity they can provide for clients transacting in some areas – such as high-yield and emerging-market corporate bonds – that are particularly vulnerable to market volatility.
And at the same time, exchange-traded funds have proliferated, while financial intermediaries have shrunk relative to bigger and more complex end users.
Third, the financial system has yet to feel the full impact of technological disruptions fueled by advances in big data, artificial intelligence, and mobility, which already are in the process of upending a growing number of other established sectors.
And the financial-technology (fintech) activities that have expanded are inadequately regulated, and have yet to be tested by a full market cycle.
To be sure, another systemic financial crisis that threatens growth and economic prosperity worldwide likely won’t originate in the banking system.
But it would be premature to assert that we have put all the risks confronting the financial system behind us.
Because risks have morphed – and migrated out of the banking system – regulators and supervisors will have to step up their efforts and widen their focus to see beyond the banks.
After all, as Greg Ip of the Wall Street Journal pointed out in 2015, “Squeezing risk out of the economy can be like pressing on a water bed: the risk often re-emerges elsewhere.
So it goes with efforts to make the financial system safer since the financial crisis.”
The Overselling of Financial Transaction Taxes
CAMBRIDGE – However November’s presidential election in the United States turns out, one proposal that will likely live on is the introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT).
While by no means a crazy idea, an FTT is hardly the panacea that its hard-left advocates hold it out to be.
It is certainly a poor substitute for deeper tax reform aimed at making the system simpler, more transparent, and more progressive.
As American society ages and domestic inequality worsens, and assuming that interest rates on the national debt eventually rise, taxes will need to go up, urgently on the wealthy but some day on the middle class.
There is no magic wand, and the politically expedient idea of a “Robin Hood” tax on trading is being badly oversold.
True, a number of advanced countries already use FTTs of one sort or another.
The United Kingdom has had a “stamp tax” on stock sales for centuries, and the US had one from 1914 to 1964.
The European Union has a controversial plan on the drawing boards that would tax a much broader array of transactions.
The presidential campaign of US Senator Bernie Sanders, which dominates the intellectual debate in the Democratic Party, has argued for a broad-based tax covering stocks, bonds, and derivatives (which include a vast array of more complex instruments such as options and swaps).
The claim is that such a tax will help repress the forces that led to the financial crisis, raise a surreal amount of revenue to pay for progressive causes, and barely impact middle-class taxpayers.
So far, Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has embraced a narrower version that would target mainly high-speed traders, who account for a large percentage of all stock transactions, and whose contribution to social welfare is open to question.
Clinton, however, may well shift closer to Sanders’s position over time, as she has on other issues.
Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has not yet articulated a coherent position on the topic, but his views often come down remarkably close to those of Sanders.
The idea of taxing financial transactions dates back to John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s and was taken up by Yale professor and Nobel laureate James Tobin (who, incidentally, was my undergraduate professor) in the 1970s.
The idea, in Tobin’s words, was to “throw sand in the wheels” of financial markets to slow them down and make them hew more closely to economic fundamentals.
Unfortunately, this rationale has not held up particularly well either in theory or in practice.
Particularly misguided is the idea that FTTs would have significantly muted the buildup to the 2008 financial crisis.
Centuries of experience with financial crises, including in countries with FTTs, strongly suggests otherwise.
What is really needed is better regulation of financial markets.
The unwieldy and deeply imperfect 2010 Dodd Frank legislation, with its thousands of pages of provisions, is a stopgap measure; few serious people view it as a long-term solution.
A far better idea is to force financial firms to issue much more equity (stock), as Stanford University’s Anat Admati has proposed.
The more banks are forced to evaluate risks based on shareholder losses rather than government bailouts, the safer the system will be.
(On this score, Boston University professor Laurence Kotlikoff’s more radical ideas for taking leverage out of the financial system merit serious attention, even if his own quixotic presidential campaign otherwise goes unnoticed).
The fundamental problem with FTTs is that they are distortionary; for example, by driving down stock prices, they make raising capital more expensive for firms.
In the long run, this lowers labor productivity and wage levels.
True, all taxes are distorting, and the government has to raise money somehow.
Yet economists view FTTs as particularly troublesome because they distort intermediate activity, which amplifies their effects.
A modest tax that is narrowly targeted, like the UK’s, does not seem to cause much harm; but the revenue is modest.
To get more revenue requires casting the net much wider.
For this reason, the Sanders plan covers derivative instruments that would circumvent the FTT (for example, by allowing people to trade income streams on assets without trading ownership).
But extending the tax to derivatives is a messy business, because their complexities make it difficult to define precisely what should be taxed.
And as the impact of the tax expands, it becomes hard to know what the ultimate effects on the real economy will be.
It is certainly difficult to determine whether the outsize revenue estimates of the Sanders campaign could be realized; many studies suggest otherwise.
The claim is that the US can collect more than five times the amount the UK collects on its narrow tax – an amount equal to more than 10% of revenue from personal income tax.
The problem is that trading will likely collapse in many areas, and many financial trades will be executed in other countries.
If economic growth is affected, eventually other tax revenues will fall, and if government bonds are covered, borrowing costs will rise.
The US desperately needs comprehensive tax reform, ideally a progressive tax on consumption.
In any case, a properly designed FTT can be no more than a small part of a much larger strategy, whether for reforming the tax system or for regulating financial markets.
Financing Education for All
NEW YORK – Of all of the investments needed to achieve sustainable development, none is more important than a quality education for every child.
In a knowledge-based world economy, a good education is vital for finding decent work; achieving good health; building functioning communities; developing the skills to be a dependable parent; and growing up to be an engaged and responsible citizen.
Indeed, it is no surprise that the most brutish and violent groups in the world, such as Nigeria’s Boko Haram, attack education.
And it was right on the mark to award the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize to Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager shot by the Taliban for her brave advocacy of girls’ education.
When the world’s governments launch the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) this September, they will rightly put education for all children at the forefront, alongside ending extreme poverty, hunger, and death from preventable and treatable causes.
Yet, while many poor countries have increased domestic financing for education, the international community has not yet done its part.
Aid for education remains too low and too fragmented.
In advance of adopting the SDGs, at the Conference on Financing for Development in July, the world has the chance to put real resources behind the Education SDG.
The three major types of partners convening in Addis Ababa – governments, philanthropists, and top companies – should pool resources to enable impoverished countries to scale up education, especially at the pre-K and secondary levels.
The time has come to create a Global Fund for Education to ensure that even the world’s poorest children have the chance to receive a quality education at least through secondary school.
This is how malaria, AIDS, and vaccine-preventable diseases have been battled successfully in the past 15 years.
The United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, and other governments teamed up with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, private companies like Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Ericsson, Sumitomo Chemical, and others to ensure that life-saving vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics could reach the poorest of the poor.
The results have been remarkable: millions of lives have been saved, and economic growth has been boosted.
We must now do the same for education.
Though access to primary schooling has expanded dramatically over the past two decades, a transformative breakthrough in quality learning and secondary education has remained out of reach – until now.
The spread of computers, mobile phones, and broadband coverage to the poorest regions of the world could – and should – ensure that every child in low-income countries has access to the same trove of online information and quality learning materials as children in high-income countries.
Scaling up the use of information and communications technology (ICT), together with improved access to educational innovations, trained teachers and village education workers, and better measurement of learning outcomes, would enable low- and middle-income countries to create high-quality education systems within the next 15 years.
In the meantime, students in impoverished rural schools that currently lack books, electricity, and trained teachers would be connected online – via solar panels and wireless broadband – to quality educational materials, free online courses, and other schools, thereby closing a resource gap that, until recently, seemed insurmountable.
The world even has the organizational leadership to make this possible.
The Global Partnership for Education is a worldwide coalition of governments and NGOs that has been working for more than a decade with the world’s poorest countries to help them scale up quality education.
Yet, despite the GPE’s tremendous success in encouraging poor countries to mobilize their own budget resources to expand the reach and quality of their educational programs, rich countries have not adequately supported this effort by closing the financing gap these countries face.
The GPE should be supported to help build a true Global Fund for Education to ensure that every low-income country that puts in place an effective national strategy and domestic financing would have international support to accomplish its goals.
The additional financing required is modest.
UNESCO recently estimated the annual education “financing gap” of low- and lower-middle-income countries – to cover education up through lower secondary school – to be around $22 billion.
Ensuring the scale-up of upper-secondary school and ICT access might raise the needed annual sum to around $40 billion, with detailed cost estimates still to be made.
Such aid would be needed only until today’s poor countries achieve enough economic progress to cover the education bill on their own.
That $40 billion might seem like a lot of money, but consider this: The world’s richest 80 people have an estimated net worth of around $2 trillion dollars.
If they would devote just 1% of their net worth each year, they would cover half the global financial need.
Facebook, Google, Ericsson, Huawei, Samsung, Microsoft, Cisco, and other ICT giants could cover at least another $10 billion per year, in cash and in kind.
A few forward-looking governments could then close the remaining $10 billion gap.
As we have seen with immunization, this is the kind of partnership that is needed to take the SDGs from rhetoric to reality.
The beauty of a new Global Fund for Education is that, once it got underway, it would quickly attract supporters from around the world.
Arab governments would want to ensure that all Arabic-speaking children receive a decent ICT-backed education; Brazil and Portugal would surely contribute to ensure that Africa’s many Portuguese speakers benefit from scaled-up education systems.
Innovative high-tech companies would scramble to put their learning tools in front of the world’s children.
Local universities would train teachers and villagers on how to maximize the potential of these new technologies.
The stars – the SDGs, the ICT giants, mobile broadband, online learning, and philanthropists – are aligning for such a scenario.
A Global Fund for Education, announced at the Conference on Financing for Development, would be the best news possible for today’s children everywhere and a dazzling inauguration for the SDGs.
Europe’s Dysfunctional Growth Compact
BRUSSELS – Recently, a €10 billion ($13 billion) shortfall in this year’s European Union budget came to light.
As a result, the EU cannot reimburse member states for recent unexpected expenditures, including emergency outlays, such as aid to Italian earthquake victims, and spending aimed at boosting economic growth and employment, such as the accelerated absorption of unused Structural and Cohesion Funds.
Member states have refused the European Commission’s request for extra contributions to cover the shortfall, causing talks over next year’s budget to collapse.
Meanwhile, negotiations over the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), the central-planning instrument for the use of EU funds, have broken down, owing to disagreement over key issues, including the size of the budget and the composition of expenditure.
The decision has been postponed until early next year.
The situation has highlighted the ambiguity surrounding the EU budget’s role in European integration.
While all EU leaders have advocated using the budget to stimulate economic growth, little action is being taken.
This raises doubts about the so-called “growth compact” launched by the European Council in June, particularly about the political commitment to mobilize €120 billion quickly by reallocating unused Structural and Cohesion Funds and increasing the European Investment Bank’s lending capacity.
Indeed, although European governments have agreed to encourage faster absorption of EU funds in crisis countries, they have refused to pay into the EU budget to enable the funds’ disbursement.
This contradiction signals that national interests continue to prevail in EU budget negotiations, which are often exploited for domestic political gain in member states.
Unless a mechanism is introduced that facilitates the rapid disbursement of EU funds, thus insulating the budget from destructive politicization, these funds cannot be used to stimulate growth in times of crisis.
Not all member states contribute equally to the EU budget; some are net contributors, while others are net beneficiaries.
At the end of EU-financed investment projects – payments for which are agreed and executed in the annual budget framework – the money is transferred to the beneficiary.
Cash to net beneficiaries is paid in by net contributors.
One country’s inflow of EU money is thus another country’s outflow – and these are grants, not loans.
As a result, agreement every seven years on overall expenditures is inadequate to preclude conflict on annual budgets.
Nonetheless, steps can be taken to prevent political deadlock in budget negotiations, while increasing the budget’s flexibility so that it can be used to stimulate growth.
For example, some leveraging of the budget could be allowed, although this would spark controversy, given that EU treaties require that the budget remains balanced at all times.
But the EU budget has already enabled an indirect form of leveraging: the European Commission’s use of implicit budget guarantees to raise capital on financial markets.
These funds are used to provide financial assistance to non-eurozone EU countries through the Medium-Term Financial Assistance Facility, to eurozone countries through the now-expired European Financial Stabilization Mechanism, and to partner third countries.
Between the MTFA, the EFSM, and payments to third countries, the total exposure this year is €70.5 billion.
Some borrowing over the seven-year MFF period may be possible, while upholding the medium-term objective of a balanced budget.
Such leveraging of the EU budget would complement the recently established European Stabilization Mechanism (the successor to the EFSM) and the MTFA.
Countries receiving assistance should be given the option of applying for an anticipated disbursement of EU funds.
Following a request by a member state, the Commission would be entitled to borrow on capital markets under the implicit EU budget guarantee, with the maximum amount determined by the size of the country’s unused (pre-allocated) Structural and Cohesion Funds.
The capital would be repaid in annual installments as the funds become available through the EU budget, while the national co-financing rate would apply to interest payments.
This framework would reduce incentives for using annual EU budget negotiations to advance political agendas.
Net contributors would be locked into a relationship with the markets – a convincing creditor.
At the same time, imposing conditionality on this kind of disbursement would enhance legitimacy, as opposed to the current framework, in which beneficiaries seek entitlements.
Indeed, all EU countries – not just eurozone members – would benefit from such a framework.
Such an initiative could co-exist with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy’s proposal to create a risk-sharing mechanism only for eurozone countries.
The revamped growth compact would more effectively allocate European resources and increase the flexibility of permanent transfers from rich to poor countries – provided that the money is used for productive investment.
Van Rompuy’s budget would also help to stabilize the eurozone in the event that asymmetric shocks require temporary transfers from unaffected to crisis-stricken countries.
In fact, the two instruments may well be complementary in eurozone countries.
Crises are typically associated with a drop not only in actual growth, but also in a country’s growth potential, owing to deferred investment.
A risk-sharing facility could limit the decline in actual growth after a crisis, while prompt EU-financed investment would prevent a country from shifting to a lower growth path.
Financing International Cooperation
NEW YORK – Today, the provision of public goods and services at the global and regional level is dangerously inadequate.
The United Nations system, the European Union, and other multilateral organizations are under great stress, because their budgets are inadequate to meet their responsibilities.
While a few free-market ideologues may still argue that profit-motivated corporations should run the world without governments, experience proves otherwise.
Governments are essential to provide universal access to vital services such as health and education; infrastructure such as highways, railways, and the power grid; and funding for scientific research and early-stage technology.
Governments are also needed to tax the rich and transfer income to the poor.
Otherwise our societies will become dangerously unequal, unjust, and unstable – as is occurring in the US today.
Governments in successful high-income countries collect at least 25% of the national income in taxes to carry out these functions.
In the world’s most successful economies, notably the social democracies of Northern Europe, governments tax around 50% of the national income.
They use these revenues for three vital functions: public services, public investments, and transfer payments from rich to poor.
These three public functions are urgently needed beyond the national level.
Groups of neighboring countries – such as the EU and the African Union (AU) – need public services, public investments, and transfer payments that cut across national borders, and that often involve dozens of countries simultaneously.
Regional groups need adequate regional budgets to carry out their vital functions.
In the same way, the UN as a whole needs an adequate budget to finance global efforts to fight climate change, protect the oceans, end extreme poverty, resist nuclear proliferation, and stop local conflicts through the UN Security Council before they become global disasters.
The EU, AU, and other regional groups should be building regional power grids based on renewable energy (such as wind, solar, and hydro power) instead of fossil fuels.
These groups should also be transferring funds from the richest to the poorest regions to eliminate pockets of persistent poverty.
And they should be protecting nature across borders and investing much more in science and technology to take advantage of the digital revolution.
Yet the budget resources available for such multilateral cooperation are a pittance.
While many EU member states tax at least 25% of national income for public spending at the national and local levels, the funding available for the EU-wide budget is just 1% of the member countries’ combined income.
Some additional funding is available through the European Investment Bank, but this is for investment projects that can be funded on a market basis.
The reason for the underfunding is obvious.
Taxes are under the jurisdiction of national and local governments, which jealously guard their tax prerogatives.
The national governments agreed to transfer only 1% of national income to Brussels for EU-wide purposes.
The result is an EU with very big aspirations and a very small operating budget.
Still worse, the nationalists in Europe (such as the United Kingdom’s Brexiteers) claim that the EU budget is too large, not woefully small.
No country could hold itself together on just 1% of the national income.
And it may happen that the EU, too, will be unable to maintain itself on such a tiny budget.
EU-wide public services, investments, and transfers are a tiny fraction of what is needed to have a truly effective union.
The situation is even more dire at the global level.
The UN’s regular budget is a mere $2.7 billion per year, or just 0.003% of the world’s $90 trillion total income.
Its total annual revenue, including additional contributions of member states for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, is around $50 billion, or 0.06% of the world income – a fraction of the real need.
UN member states rightly adopt bold measures such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement, yet lack the financial means to implement them.
Even though the UN budget is small, the US government routinely attacks the institution for being bloated and too expensive.
The US pays around 22% of the annual $2.7 billion regular budget, or some $600 million each year, but this is less than $2 per American!
Adding in peacekeeping and other payments, the total annual US contribution per year comes to around $10 billion, or roughly $30 per capita.
By being so miserly, the US does itself a disservice.
The ultimate costs to the US, and the world, of chronic under-investment in global needs could run into the tens of trillions of dollars.
In addition to payments through the UN, high-income countries make direct payments to poorer countries in the form of official development assistance.
Combined net ODA totals around $150 billion each year, or just 0.31% of the income of the donor countries, compared with the long-promised 0.7% of income for ODA.
Because these global transfers are so small, extreme poverty persists in a world of plenty.
And long-standing pledges by rich countries to provide poor countries with at least $100 billion per year in climate-related financing are still unfulfilled.
The world must get serious about matching multilateral money with multilateral needs.
The EU should quickly double the EU budget to 2% of EU income, and more over time.
Likewise, the world should devote at least 2% of world income to global public goods and services to end extreme poverty, fight climate change, protect nature, save millions of destitute people from premature deaths, ensure schooling for all children, and uphold peace through the UN.
The time has come to think about new global taxes – on corporate incomes, offshore accounts, international financial transactions, billionaires’ net wealth, and pollution – to pay for an interconnected world under stress.
With creativity, cooperation, and foresight, we can mobilize new revenues to turn our great global wealth into sustainable wellbeing for all.
Financing the Green Economy
ADDIS ABABA – At the climate-change summit in Copenhagen last December, political leaders expressed a strong will to urgently combat global warming.
As we approach the next climate-change summit in Cancún, Mexico, this December, the international community must deliver concrete results and move forward to address the challenge.
Finance is a key ingredient of the global response to climate change.
In this regard, at the Copenhagen summit developed countries committed themselves to the goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. These funds would be transferred to developing countries in the context of meaningful – and transparently implemented – mitigation measures taken on their behalf.
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s High-level Advisory Group on Climate Finance (AGF), which we chaired, was established to identify practical proposals for how developed countries can mobilize this level of climate financing by 2020.
The 21-member group included heads of state and ministers from both developed and developing countries, representatives from international organizations, experts on public finance and development, and leaders from the private sector.
Admittedly, the current global economic environment has placed public finances in many developed countries under extreme pressure.
Nevertheless, the AGF’s report concludes that reaching the goal of raising $100 billion a year by 2020, while challenging, is feasible.
It will require a mix of new public sources, a scaling-up of existing public sources, and increased private flows.
Among the AGF’s conclusions, which we have presented to the UN Secretary-General, there are some important messages:
First, a carbon price in the range of $20-25 per ton of CO2 by 2020 is key to mobilizing climate finance at this level.
Carbon prices expand the potential for both public and private financing by raising public revenue and creating private-sector demand for emission reductions.
Second, new public mechanisms can mobilize tens of billions of dollars annually, an important step towards the $100-billion goal.
Examples include the auctioning of emissions allowances, carbon taxes, and the pricing of emissions from international transport.
Policy instruments based on carbon pricing are particularly attractive, because they raise revenue for adaptation to climate change in developing countries while creating incentives for mitigation in developed countries.
Third, international private investment flows are essential.
It is the private sector that will finance most low-carbon, sustainable growth.
Public funding should help leverage climate-friendly private investments.
The multilateral development banks, in close collaboration with the UN system, can play a significant multiplier role in this regard.
Several sources of financing for adaptation and mitigation efforts in developing countries could be made operational relatively quickly.
We need to make progress on establishing the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund, including, possibly, regional and thematic vehicles, such as an Africa Green Fund.
Ensuring economic growth and addressing climate change do not have to be opposing goals. They can and should go hand in hand; what we need is climate-resilient, low-carbon growth.
It is now up to governments, international institutions, and the private sector to draw on our analysis in support of climate action.
Financing Health and Education for All
NEW YORK – In 2015, around 5.9 million children under the age of five, almost all in developing countries, died from easily preventable or treatable causes.
And up to 200 million young children and adolescents do not attend primary or secondary school, owing to poverty, including 110 million through the lower-secondary level, according to a recent estimate.
In both cases, massive suffering could be ended with a modest amount of global funding.
Children in poor countries die from causes – such as unsafe childbirth, vaccine-preventable diseases, infections such as malaria for which low-cost treatments exist, and nutritional deficiencies – that have been almost totally eliminated in the rich countries.
In a moral world, we would devote our utmost effort to end such deaths.
In fact, the world has made a half-hearted effort.
Deaths of young children have fallen to slightly under half the 12.7 million recorded in 1990, thanks to additional global funding for disease control, channeled through new institutions such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.
When I first recommended such a fund in 2000, skeptics said that more money would not save lives.
Yet the Global Fund proved the doubters wrong: More money prevented millions of deaths from AIDS, TB, and malaria.
It was well used.
The reason that child deaths fell to 5.9 million, rather to near zero, is that the world gave only about half the funding necessary.
While most countries can cover their health needs with their own budgets, the poorest countries cannot.
They need about $50 billion per year of global help to close the financing gap.
Current global aid for health runs at about $25 billion per year.
While these numbers are only approximate, we need roughly an additional $25 billion per year to help prevent up to six million deaths per year.
It’s hard to imagine a better bargain.
Similar calculations help us to estimate the global funding needed to enable all children to complete at least a high-school education.
UNESCO recently calculated the global education “financing gap” to cover the incremental costs – of classrooms, teachers, and supplies – of universal completion of secondary school at roughly $39 billion.
With current global funding for education at around $10-15 billion per year, the gap is again roughly $25 billion, similar to health care.
And, as with health care, such increased global funding could effectively flow through a new Global Fund for Education.
Thus, an extra $50 billion or so per year could help ensure that children everywhere have access to basic health care and schooling.
The world’s governments have already adopted these two objectives – universal health care and universal quality education – in the new Sustainable Development Goals.
An extra $50 billion per year is not hard to find.
One option targets my own country, the United States, which currently gives only around 0.17% of gross national income for development aid, or roughly one-quarter of the international target of 0.7% of GNI for development assistance.
Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom each give at least 0.7% of GNI; the US can and should do so as well.
If it did, that extra 0.53% of GNI would add roughly $90 billion per year of global funding.
The US currently spends around 5% of GDP, or roughly $900 billion per year, on military-related spending (for the Pentagon, the CIA, veterans, and others).
It could and should transfer at least $90 billion of that to development aid.
Such a shift in focus from war to development would greatly bolster US and global security; the recent US wars in North Africa and the Middle East have cost trillions of dollars and yet have weakened, not strengthened, national security.
A second option would tax the global rich, who often hide their money in tax havens in the Caribbean and elsewhere.
Many of these tax havens are UK overseas territories.
Most are closely connected with Wall Street and the City of London.
The US and British governments have protected the tax havens mainly because the rich people who put their money there also put their money into campaign contributions or into hiring politicians’ family members.
The tax havens should be called upon to impose a small tax on their deposits, which total at least $21 trillion.
The rich countries could enforce such a tax by threatening to cut off noncompliant havens’ access to global financial markets.
Of course, the havens should also ensure transparency and crack down on tax evasion and corporate secrecy.
Even a deposit tax as low as 0.25% per year on $21 trillion of deposits would raise around $50 billion per year.
Both solutions would be feasible and relatively straightforward to implement.
They would underpin the new global commitments contained in the SDGs.
At the recent Astana Economic Forum, Kazakhstan’s President Nursultan Nazarbayev wisely called for some way to tax offshore deposits to fund global health and education.
Other world leaders should rally to his call to action.
Our world is immensely wealthy and could easily finance a healthy start in life for every child on the planet through global funds for health and education.
A small shift of funds from wasteful US military spending, or a very small levy on tax havens’ deposits – or similar measures to make the super-rich pay their way – could quickly and dramatically improve poor children’s life chances and make the world vastly fairer, safer, and more productive.
There is no excuse for delay.
Education Saved My Life
NEW YORK – My family was murdered before I could tie my shoes.
As a young boy in Sierra Leone, years that should have been playful and carefree were spent fighting in someone else’s war.
For me, childhood was a nightmare; escape always seemed impossible.
But when the war officially ended, in 2002, I began finding ways to recover.
One of the most important has been an opportunity I couldn’t have imagined as an angry, illiterate, nine-year-old soldier: school.
I am living proof of the transformative power of education.
Thanks to hard work and lots of good fortune, I managed to graduate from high school and then university.
Now, in just a few months, I will begin graduate classes at the Fordham University School of Law, an unimaginable destination for most of the former child soldiers in my country.
And yet, throughout my brief educational journey, one question has always nagged me: why did luck play such a crucial role?
After all, education is supposed to be a universal human right.
If only it were that simple.
Today, more than 260 million children are out of school, and over 500 million boys and girls who do attend are not receiving a quality education, as the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity discovered.
By 2030, more than half of the world’s school-age children – some 800 million kids – will lack the basic skills needed to thrive or secure a job in the workplace of the future.
Addressing this requires money.
But while education may be the best investment a government can make to ensure a better future for its people, education financing worldwide is far too low.
In fact, education accounts for just 10% of total international development aid, down from 13% a decade ago.
To put this in perspective, developing countries receive just $10 per child annually in global education support, barely enough to cover the cost of a single textbook.
In an age of self-driving cars and smart refrigerators, this dearth of funding is simply unacceptable.
Over the past few years, I have advocated on behalf of three global education initiatives – the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity (Education Commission), the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), and the Education Cannot Wait fund (ECW).
I have done so eagerly, because these organizations are working collectively toward the same goal: to raise funds to make quality education for every child, everywhere, more than a matter of luck.
One of the best ways to do this is by supporting the International Finance Facility for Education, an initiative spearheaded by the Education Commission that could unlock the greatest global investment in education ever recorded.
Young people around the world understand what’s at stake.
Earlier this month, Global Youth Ambassadors, representing their peers in nearly 80 countries, presented a petition signed by more than 1.5 million children to United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres calling for the UN to support the finance facility.
By leveraging roughly $2 billion in donor guarantees, the finance facility aims to make $10 billion in grant and concessional funding available to countries that need it most.
If adopted widely, the program could make it possible for developing countries to provide quality education to millions more children, including refugees, young girls, and former child soldiers like me.
Politicians often say that young people are the leaders of tomorrow.
That’s true; we are.
But platitudes not backed by financial support are meaningless.
Simply put, the world must unite to fund quality education for everyone.
The International Finance Facility for Education – which is already backed by the World Bank, regional development banks, GPE, ECW, and numerous UN agencies – is among the best ways to make that happen.
Twenty years ago, law school was an impossible dream for me.
Today, thanks to hard work, global support, and much good fortune, my future is brighter than it has ever been.
But my story should not be an exception.
To ensure that others can gain a quality education and follow the path that has opened up to me, we must remove luck from the equation.
Finding the Keys to National Prosperity
NEW YORK – In many of history’s most successful economic reforms, clever countries have learned from the policy successes of others, adapting them to local conditions.
In the long history of economic development, eighteenth-century Britain learned from Holland; early nineteenth-century Prussia learned from Britain and France; mid-nineteenth-century Meiji Japan learned from Germany; post-World War II Europe learned from the United States; and Deng Xiaoping’s China learned from Japan.
Through a process of institutional borrowing and creative adaptation, successful economic institutions and cutting-edge technologies spread around the world, and thereby boost global growth.
Today, too, there are some great opportunities for this kind of “policy arbitrage,” if more countries would only take the time to learn from other countries’ successes.
For example, while many countries are facing a jobs crisis, one part of the capitalist world is doing just fine: northern Europe, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia.
Germany’s unemployment rate this past summer was around 5.5%, and its youth unemployment rate was around 8% – remarkably low compared with many other high-income economies.
How do northern Europeans do it?
All of them use active labor market policies, including flex time, school-to-work apprenticeships (especially Germany), and extensive job training and matching.
Likewise, in an age of chronic budget crises, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland run near-balanced budgets.
All three rely on budget rules that call for cyclically adjusted budget balance.
And all three take a basic precaution to keep their entitlement spending under control: a retirement age of at least 65.
This keeps costs much lower than in France, and Greece, for example, where the retirement age is 60 or below, and where pension outlays are soaring as a result.
In an age of rising health-care costs, most high-income countries – Canada, the European Union’s Western economies, and Japan – manage to keep their total health-care costs below 12% of GDP, with excellent health outcomes, while the US spends nearly 18% of GDP, yet with decidedly mediocre health outcomes.
And, America’s is the only for-profit health system of the entire bunch.
A new report by the US Institute of Medicine has found that America’s for-profit system squanders around $750 billion, or 5% of GDP, on waste, fraud, duplication, and bureaucracy.
In an age of soaring oil costs, a few countries have made a real difference in energy efficiency.
The OECD countries, on average, use 160 kilograms of oil-equivalent energy for every $1,000 of GDP (measured at purchasing power parity).
But, in energy-efficient Switzerland, energy use is just 100 kg per $1,000 of GDP, and in Demark it is just 110 kg, compared with 190 kg in the US.
In an age of climate change, several countries are demonstrating how to move to a low-carbon economy.
On average, the rich countries emit 2.3 kg of CO2 for every kg of oil-equivalent unit of energy.
But France emits just 1.4 kg, owing to its enormous success in deploying safe, low-cost nuclear energy.
Sweden, with its hydropower, is even lower, at 0.9 kg.
And, while Germany is abandoning domestic production of nuclear energy for political reasons, we can bet that it will nonetheless continue to import electricity from France’s nuclear plants.
In an age of intense technological competition, countries that combine public and private research and development (R&D) financing are outpacing the rest.
The US continues to excel, with huge recent breakthroughs in Mars exploration and genomics, though it is now imperiling that excellence through budget cuts.
Meanwhile, Sweden and South Korea are now excelling economically on the basis of R&D spending of around 3.5% of GDP, while Israel’s R&D outlays stand at a remarkable 4.7% of GDP.
In an age of rising inequality, at least some countries have narrowed their wealth and income gaps.
Brazil is the recent pacesetter, markedly expanding public education and systematically attacking remaining pockets of poverty through targeted transfer programs.
As a result, income inequality in Brazil is declining.
And, in an age of pervasive anxiety, Bhutan is asking deep questions about the meaning and nature of happiness itself.
In search of a more balanced society that combines economic prosperity, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability, Bhutan famously pursues Gross National Happiness rather than Gross National Product.
Many other countries – including the United Kingdom – are now following Bhutan’s lead in surveying their citizenry about life satisfaction.
The countries highest on the ladder of life satisfaction are Denmark, Finland, and Norway.
Yet there is hope for those at lower latitudes as well.
Tropical Costa Rica also ranks near the top of the happiness league.
What we can say is that all of the happiest countries emphasize equality, solidarity, democratic accountability, environmental sustainability, and strong public institutions.
So here is one model economy: German labor-market policies, Swedish pensions, French low-carbon energy, Canadian health care, Swiss energy efficiency, American scientific curiosity, Brazilian anti-poverty programs, and Costa Rican tropical happiness.
Of course, back in the real world, most countries will not achieve such bliss anytime soon.
But, by opening our eyes to policy successes abroad, we would surely speed the path to national improvement in countries around the world.
The Globalization Disconnect
NEW HAVEN – While seemingly elegant in theory, globalization suffers in practice.
That is the lesson of Brexit and of the rise of Donald Trump in the United States.
And it also underpins the increasingly virulent anti-China backlash now sweeping the world.
Those who worship at the altar of free trade – including me – must come to grips with this glaring disconnect.
Truth be known, there is no rigorous theory of globalization.
The best that economists can offer is David Ricardo’s early nineteenth-century framework: if a country simply produces in accordance with its comparative advantage (in terms of resource endowments and workers’ skills), presto, it will gain through increased cross-border trade.
Trade liberalization – the elixir of globalization – promises benefits for all.
That promise arguably holds in the long run, but a far tougher reality check invariably occurs in the short run.
Brexit – the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union – is just the latest case in point.
Voters in the UK objected to several of the key premises of regional integration: free labor mobility and seemingly open-ended immigration, regulation by supranational authorities in Brussels, and currency union (which has serious flaws, such as the lack of a fiscal transfer mechanism among member states).
Economic integration and globalization are not exactly the same thing, but they rest on the same Ricardian principles of trade liberalization – principles that are falling on deaf ears in the political arena.
In the US, Trump’s ascendancy and the political traction gained by Senator Bernie Sanders’s primary campaign reflect many of the same sentiments that led to Brexit.
From immigration to trade liberalization, economic pressures on a beleaguered middle class contradict the core promises of globalization.
As is often the case – and particularly in a presidential election year – America’s politicians resort to the blame game in confronting these tough issues.
Trump has singled out China and Mexico, and Sanders’s opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership – the proposed trade deal between the US and 11 Pacific Rim countries – has pushed Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party’s nominee, to adopt a similar stance.
In short, globalization has lost its political support – unsurprising in a world that bears little resemblance to the one inhabited by Ricardo two centuries ago.
Ricardo’s arguments, couched in terms of England’s and Portugal’s comparative advantages in cloth and wine, respectively, hardly seem relevant for today’s hyper-connected, knowledge-based world.
The Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson, who led the way in translating Ricardian foundations into modern economics, reached a similar conclusion late in his life, when he pointed out how a disruptive low-wage technology imitator like China could turn the theory of comparative advantage inside out.
Nor is it just a problem with an antiquated theory.
Recent trends in global trade are also flashing warning signs.
According to the International Monetary Fund, annual growth in the volume of world trade has averaged just 3% over the 2009-2016 period – half the 6% rate from 1980 to 2008.
This reflects not only the Great Recession, but also an unusually anemic recovery.
With world trade shifting to a decidedly lower trajectory, political resistance to globalization has only intensified.
Of course, this isn’t the first time that globalization has run into trouble.
Globalization 1.0 – the surge in global trade and international capital flows that occurred in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries – met its demise between World War I and the Great Depression.
Global trade fell by some 60% from 1929 to 1932, as major economies turned inward and embraced protectionist trade policies, such as America’s infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930.
But the stakes may be greater if today’s more powerful globalization were to meet a similar fate.
In contrast to Globalization 1.0, which was largely confined to the cross-border exchange of tangible (manufactured) goods, the scope of Globalization 2.0 is far broader, including growing trade in many so-called intangibles – once nontradable services.
Similarly, the means of Globalization 2.0 are far more sophisticated than those of its antecedent.
The connectivity of Globalization 1.0 occurred via ships and eventually railroads and motor vehicles.
Today, these transportation systems are far more advanced – augmented by the Internet and its enhancement of global supply chains.
The Internet has also enabled instantaneous cross-border dissemination of knowledge-based services such as software programming, engineering and design, medical screening, and accounting, legal, and consulting work.
The sharpest contrast between the two waves of globalization is in the speed of technology absorption and disruption.
New information technologies have been adopted at an unusually rapid rate.
It took only five years for 50 million US households to begin surfing the Internet, whereas it took 38 years for a similar number to gain access to radios.
Sadly, the economics profession has failed to grasp the inherent problems with globalization.
In fixating on an antiquated theory, they have all but ignored the here and now of a mounting worker backlash.
Yet the breadth and speed of Globalization 2.0 demand new approaches to cushion the blows of this disruption.
Unfortunately, safety-net programs to help trade-displaced or trade-pressured workers are just as obsolete as theories of comparative advantage.
America’s Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program, for example, was enacted in 1962 for the manufacturing-based economy of yesteryear.
According to a report published by the Peterson Institute, only two million US workers have benefited from TAA since 1974.
The design of more enlightened policies must account for the powerful pressures now bearing down on a much broader array of workers.
The hyper-speed of Globalization 2.0 suggests the need for quicker triggers and wider coverage for worker retraining, relocation allowances, job-search assistance, wage insurance for older workers, and longer-duration unemployment benefits.
As history cautions, the alternative – whether it is Brexit or America’s new isolationism – is an accident waiting to happen.
It is up to those of us who defend free trade and globalization to prevent that, by offering concrete solutions that address the very real problems that now afflict so many workers.
Firebombing the Messenger in Armenia
Late last month, while putting the finishing touches on the next edition of our newspaper, Haykakan Zhamanak (The Armenian Times), we heard an explosion outside our office.
Staff members rushed to find my car on fire.
That explosion was not unanticipated – nor was the announcement by Armenia’s police that the car had caught fire due to technical problems.
But the real problem is censorship, for the explosion was but the latest offensive in Armenia’s hidden war against the press.
For us the battle for press freedom began in 1999, soon after founding our newspaper, then named Oragir (Diary).
It made an instant impact, but not in the way we hoped.
Throughout 1999 there were more court cases against Oragir than against all other Armenian media combined since independence in 1991.
In one case, the prosecutor’s office brought criminal charges against me as editor-in-chief: I was accused of slandering an Armenian political figure and of insulting a state official. As a result, the court sentenced me to one year in prison.
By a lucky twist, however, on the day the court ruled, Lord Russell Johnston, Chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, was in Armenia.
Lord Johnston expressed his opinion about my case in his talks with the authorities, which then decided not to send me to prison.
I remained free, only to be monitored by the police.
A second trial against our newspaper had worse consequences: a $25,000 fine (a huge sum here) based on allegations that we had damaged the reputation of the Mika Armenia Company, controlled by the so-called Karabakh clan that helps rule Armenia.
The court’s verdict was based on falsified documents.
Following the verdict, bailiffs confiscated our equipment, prohibited the publishing house from printing our newspaper, and, most importantly, seized our business bank accounts, rendering us unable to pay the fine.
These events were initiated by a court wrangle with Serzh Sargsyan, then the Minister of National Security and Internal Affairs.
We demanded an apology for his impugning our paper’s reputation; he accused of us of libel.
These manipulations worked: Oragir was closed down, which forced us to appear under the name Haykakan Zhamanak .
When my time under police supervision ended, the prosecutor’s office quickly brought a new criminal case of slander against me.
This time, Armenia’s chief of civil aviation had sued me.
Investigations lasted several months, before pressure from international organizations and public opinion forced the prosecutor to drop the charges.
Later, after his dismissal from his post, that same civil aviation chief confessed that Armenian President Robert Kocharyan had advised him to file his lawsuit.
At a press conference just hours after my car exploded, I announced my suspicion that the explosion had been organized by Gagik Tsarukyan, an MP nicknamed “Dodi Gago” (“dod” means stupid in Armenian) and one of the country’s richest men and a close friend of the president’s family.
Many Armenians believe that Tsarukyan has carte blanche to do whatever he wants, when he wants.
Indeed, he even gets to write his own history.
For although Gagik Tsarukyan was convicted of a sexual crime in the Soviet era, two years ago Armenia’s courts exonerated him by vacating the decision of the Soviet court.
Indeed, there is something of a taboo on writing about Tsarukyan, and with good reason: not only is he rich, but also he controls an army of obedient skinheads.
Armenia frequently sees skinheads attacking reporters covering opposition rallies and once severely beating a leading opposition politician.
Five years ago, Tsarukyan himself led his thugs in a break-in at our office, taking my staff hostage for several hours.
Recently, after reading some unflattering articles about him in our paper, Tsarukyan tried to invite me to a meeting.
I refused. Armenia’s paramount oligarch fumed.
He promised to punish me, and that he would act the next time Haykakan Zhamanak criticized any well-known person.
The car explosion occurred the day after we rebuked Armenia’s Police Chief.
None of us are surprised that the police are unwilling to investigate my car’s explosion.
They began to do so only ten days later, when the fire brigade stated that the fire was likely the result of an explosion incited by “outside interference.”
Such harassment is the everyday stuff of journalism in what Vladimir Putin calls the “post-Soviet space.”
Armenia may have adopted in 1995 a new Constitution with fine phrases about freedom of speech, but both the petty harassments and the mortal threats of the Soviet era remain.
Of course, we never believed that press freedom would come easily. We understood from the start that we would have to fight for it everyday.
But we never imagined the terrifying lengths to which the state – working hand-in-hand with the new oligarchic rich – would go to defeat our cause.
We will not be defeated.
An incinerated car is a small price to pay in the battle for freedom.
Firewalls to Freedom
NEW YORK – Even the most cold-hearted realists would agree that the failure of Communist censorship played a role in the collapse of the Iron Curtain: Voice of America, the fax machine, rock ‘n’ roll, and the lure of Western capitalism helped to win over the people of the Soviet Bloc.
Today, similar hopes are often vested in the Internet, with high expectations that the wealth of online information might trigger the same kind of censorship failure in contemporary authoritarian states that we saw in Eastern Europe – and with the same results.
Such expectations are not entirely unfounded, because most Internet censorship systems are not perfect.
But, while anybody with a little know-how can figure out how to circumvent, say, the “Great Firewall of China,” Internet filtering is only one layer of Chinese Internet censorship.
It is also supplemented by an increasingly sophisticated system of manipulation and spin.
While the blocking of foreign Web sites was eased during the Olympics, deletion of politically sensitive content from Chinese blogs and chat rooms continued unabated throughout 2008.
Now, a new crackdown against “vulgar” Internet content is being used to clean up politically sensitive writings – including discussion of Charter 08 , a pro-democracy treatise signed by thousands of Chinese who discovered it online.
Contrary to Western expectations, most of this domestic Internet censorship is carried out not by the government's Internet police, but by Chinese Web hosting companies, which are being held legally responsible for what their users publish.
Indeed, the Chinese Internet is evolving and adapting in ways that shore up the regime’s legitimacy.
Hundreds of thousands of people are employed as freelance Web commentators, working to spin discussions in chat rooms and on blogs in a more patriotic, pro-government direction.
Nationalistic young people, proud of China’s newfound global economic and political power, gladly volunteer their time to show off their patriotism on the Internet.
Meanwhile, China is looking to Russia, which may have invented an entirely new model of controlling the Internet without recourse to censorship.
Having established full control of traditional media, the Kremlin is now moving full-speed into the virtual world.
The authorities’ strategy is not new: establish tight control over the leading publishing platforms and fill them with propaganda and spin to shape online public opinion.
The fate of LiveJournal – the most influential blogging platform in Russia, which is often used to express dissent and protest against the government – is one unfortunate example.
In less than three years, this popular online resource has been transformed from a respectable American start-up to a shady Moscow-based enterprise, co-owned by the Kremlin’s favorite oligarchs.
Government propaganda abounds, too, generated by new media operators like Konstantin Rykov, a 29-year-old Duma deputy and the founder of New Media Stars, the Kremlin’s favorite Internet firm.
Whenever manipulation efforts fail, cyber-attacks offer yet another powerful tool to crack down on dissent without triggering public accusations of formal censorship.
This is what happened to a Georgian (known by the screen name cyxymu) who used his blog on LiveJournal to criticize how both governments handled last summer’s war.
A series of cyber-attacks followed, and was so devastating that the entire service – with its millions of other blogs – crashed, forcing LiveJournal administrators to delete his account temporarily.
As contemporary authoritarian regimes learn how to manage and engineer information flows, we must understand that promoting and protecting free speech in places like China and Russia is not a simple matter of “tearing down the wall.”
Given these governments’ complex strategies for regulating what their citizens do online – ranging from establishing effective control of private media and telecoms businesses to allowing people to blow off steam without going too far – we should be more realistic about the true extent of the Internet’s transformational potential.
An Agenda for Global Fiscal Activism
LONDON – Two important events loom on the calendar this month: the United States’ presidential election on November 8, and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond’s first Autumn Statement on November 23.
Obviously, the latter will not be as significant an event as the former, but it nonetheless will have important consequences beyond the United Kingdom.
So far this year, economics has had to compete with more emotional issues, such as personal attacks in the US election, and UK voters’ decision to leave the European Union.
But in both the US and the UK – and not only there – we can expect to hear more about active fiscal policies, especially with respect to infrastructure.
In the communiqué released after September’s G20 summit, the group’s leaders repeatedly mentioned steps to boost world growth through infrastructure investment, and argued for more coordination among monetary, fiscal, and structural policies.
Although recent data from the US and China – and surprisingly also from the eurozone and the UK – suggest that GDP growth in the fourth quarter could improve upon the sluggish performance earlier in the year, a strong case can still be made for fresh policies to strengthen the world economy.
After recently leading the UK’s Review on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), and having thought long and hard about educational initiatives, I believe that it is time for a more adventurous response to both long-term and cyclical challenges, especially for developing countries.
And reading Jeffrey D. Sachs’s recent commentary, “The Case for Sustainable Investment,” only strengthens my conviction that policymakers and key development-finance institutions have a huge opportunity.
Fiscal activism need not stop at infrastructure.
In the Review on AMR, we showed that global GDP could suffer a $100 trillion loss over the next 34 years if we do not make certain public-health interventions between now and 2050.
Those interventions would cost around $40 billion over a decade, which is to say that the investment needed to prevent $100 trillion in lost growth costs less than 0.1% of current global GDP.
As an astute investor friend pointed out to me, this would be the equivalent of a 2,500% return.
Investments in health and education are crucial for the developing world’s long-term prospects.
As someone closely associated with the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), it seems obvious to me that the New Development Bank (NDB) – or the BRICS Development Bank, as it was formerly known – can and should help these and other emerging economies cooperate in both areas.
The Review on AMR concluded that ten million annual deaths will be attributable to drug-resistant infections by 2050, and that drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis could cause one-quarter of them.
It seems only reasonable that the NDB should announce steps to support pharmaceutical research into new TB treatments and vaccines, particularly for drug-resistant strains, given that TB is especially prevalent in the BRICS.
And, beyond the BRICS, the other low-income countries that the NDB is trying to help will suffer even more without a proactive approach.
Similarly, many people in the BRICS and low-income countries do not have access to quality primary education, so the case for a major spending boost in this area should be clear.
Sachs makes the same point, and former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who is now United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, has called for more creative financing methods and social enterprise in this sector.
The NDB, the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank should all be considering the activist fiscal-policy course developed countries are now charting for themselves.
And they should take it further, because the policy imperatives they face are ultimately all interrelated.
In the West, the turn toward fiscal activism reflects widespread recognition that monetary activism has outlived its usefulness, at least at the margin.
To be sure, central banks technically should do whatever it takes to meet their inflation targets; but excessive quantitative easing has imposed high costs, and seems to have favored the few at the expense of the many.
With monetary activism past its sell-by date, an active fiscal policy that includes stronger infrastructure spending is one of the only remaining options.
But it is not a free lunch, as many of its promoters often suggest, because policymakers cannot ignore the high levels of government debt across much of the developed world.
It will be interesting to see how Hammond navigates the path toward higher infrastructure spending, while sticking to the Conservative Party’s platform of fiscal responsibility.
And in the US, if we look beyond the fog of election-season opprobrium, it appears that both sides are in favor of more infrastructure spending.
That being the case, the next US administration (regardless of who wins), together with a new UK leadership struggling to demonstrate its post-Brexit “openness,” should extend fiscal activism beyond domestic infrastructure to global development more generally.
For example, with proper support, the World Bank could create new investment vehicles such as AMR or global-education bonds, which would support future development and salvage future global growth that may otherwise be lost.
The US and the UK both need to show that they can move beyond their highly sensitive – and, frankly, narrow-minded – domestic political issues.
And they should remember that without the export markets that the BRICS and other emerging countries represent, all attempts to rebalance their economies will be in vain.
Fiscal Apocalypse Now
As support for President George W. Bush in the United States has crumbled over the past year, perhaps the most surprising element is the revolt of economists and observers of economic policy.
Last week, Peggy Noonan, a speechwriter for both President Reagan and the first President Bush declared in the Wall Street Journal that had she known what George W. Bush’s fiscal policy would be, she would have voted for Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election.
“If I’d thought [that George W. Bush] was a big-spending Rockefeller Republican.... I wouldn’t have voted for him...,” Noonan wrote.
Bush “did present himself as a conservative...[and] conservatism is hostile, for reasons ranging from the abstract and philosophical to the concrete and practical, to high spending and high taxing....” And then she falls into near-complete despair: “Mr. Bush will never have to run again, and he is in a position to come forward and make the case, even if only rhetorically, to slow and cut spending.
He has not. And there’s no sign he will...”
Noonan is not quite correct.
George W. Bush presented himself not as a normal conservative, but as something he called a “compassionate conservative,” thus preserving a certain amount of ambiguity.
Some focused on the “conservative”: they expected the Bush administration’s fiscal policy to keep a tight rein on spending and to eliminate many programs in order to finance significant tax cuts.
Others focused on the “compassionate”: they expected Bush’s fiscal policy largely to eschew tax cuts and to adopt largely Democratic spending priorities, including expanded federal aid to education and a prescription drug benefit, thereby showing that Republicans could run a more cost-effective version of the social-welfare state.
Still others interpreted “compassionate conservatism,” as the commentator Andrew Sullivan put it, as a “smokescreen...necessary for any vaguely successful retrenchment of government power in an insatiable entitlement state.”
They expected tax cuts to be followed by a fangs-bared attack on social-welfare spending once deficits reemerged.
As a result, in 2000 and 2001 nobody was really sure of the Bush administration’s policy direction.
Was it traditional fiscal conservativism?
Was it to do what Democrats do, but do it better?
Was it to “starve the beast” by pumping up government debt to the point that social programs would have to be cut?
The first two priorities, if well designed and well implemented, are certainly honorable goals for a government to pursue.
The third is less honorable, and likely to fail: it relies on the dangerously weak premise that the party in power’s political adversaries will be more public-spirited and less ruthless when they return to government.
Of course, conservatives and Republicans could hope that their own favorite policy priorities would emerge as the administration’s preferred strategy.
Or they could be content with whichever of the three strategies that they expected to see, agreeing that, in any case, fiscal policy was always going to be much better than it would have been under Democratic rule.
But then a strange thing happened: the Bush administration did not order any of the three options that were thought to be on the menu. It chose something different entirely: big tax cuts, yes, but tax cuts that were badly designed from a genuine supply-side perspective aimed at boosting growth, as well as Democratic domestic spending priorities, but very badly implemented.
Moreover, the Bush administration combined its policies with an extraordinary reluctance to veto anything coming out of Congress, and, after the year or two that it took for this to become obvious, an inability to restrain Congress at all.
What emerged was neither traditional fiscal conservatism nor Democratic policies without Democrats nor starve-the–beast populism, but something that has no name.
An exchange between two characters in a scene from the movie “Apocalypse Now” captures an anti-ethic that characterizes the Bush administration’s policies as well:
Willard: “They told me that you had gone totally insane, and that your methods were unsound.”
Kurtz: “Are my methods unsound?”
Willard: “I don’t see any method at all, sir.”
It is not that Republicans and conservatives think that the Bush administration has adopted the wrong method, but that they don’t see any method at all that has driven them into their (late) fiscal-policy revolt.
And that is why so many of them now wish that they had had a different candidate to vote for back in 2000.
Can Fiscal Contraction Ever Boost Growth?
SANTIAGO – Europe’s recent experience suggests that a fiscal contraction cannot be expansionary.
When tried in Greece, government spending fell, taxes rose, and output collapsed.
The same thing happened, in less dramatic form, elsewhere on the continent.
Europe’s austerians, as the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman likes to call them, lost the argument.
But the lessons of the West need not apply to the rest.
In two South American countries, the idea that fiscal consolidation can spur growth should be revisited.
In Brazil, the government has been cutting an enormous fiscal deficit just as the economy is recovering from its deepest recession in decades (though the corruption scandal now embroiling President Michel Temer may derail that effort).
In Argentina, President Mauricio Macri’s administration could cut the deficit more aggressively than it has so far, without risking a return to stagnation.
Fiscal contraction can be expansionary if markets expect that tightening today will prevent larger and more disruptive budget cuts (or, worse, a full-fledged fiscal crisis) in the future.
In other words, the public debt must be so large, or growing so fast, that the government could soon lose the ability to borrow further.
That was true for Greece, but not for most other European countries.
Even in the depths of the euro crisis, they could still borrow abundantly at what remained, by historical standards, low interest rates.
Yet another condition is also crucial for fiscal tightening not to wreak havoc on output: the central bank must have room to cut interest rates and allow the currency to adjust.
Clearly, this was not the case with the European Central Bank, which kept running up against the now infamous zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.
And, by definition, eurozone members like Greece, Spain, and Portugal had no currency of their own to devalue in order to spur exports.
Little wonder, then, that fiscal austerity triggered a deep recession and a surge in unemployment.
But things look different across the South Atlantic.
Brazilian gross public debt is headed toward 80% of GDP, and real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates are among the world’s highest.
Given the fiscal trends that prevailed until recently, an eventual debt crisis was a distinct possibility.
That risk remains, especially if Temer’s problems prevent an indispensable pension reform from making its way through Congress (Brazil spends as much on pensions, as a share of GDP, as Italy does, even though its population is considerably younger).
But, despite the political turmoil, markets have been sufficiently calm for the Central Bank of Brazil to cut interest rates repeatedly.
In a heavily indebted country like Brazil, fiscal consolidation can have an unconventional effect on the exchange rate: to the extent that a smaller deficit assuages fears that the government will try to inflate away its debt burden, the currency strengthens.
Brazil’s economy is large and relatively closed, so a competitive real exchange rate is less crucial for growth than it would be in a small, open economy.
Indeed, because Brazilian corporates have borrowed extensively in dollars (a consequence of sky-high local interest rates), it could well be that an appreciating currency is expansionary in the short-run: companies can clean up their balance sheets without having to shed workers or curtail investment.
An appreciating currency is what the fiscal reform effort was delivering until Temer was recorded endorsing the payment of hush money to a jailed politician.
Then both S&P and Moody’s changed their outlook from stable to negative.
The currency, unsurprisingly, has weakened from a peak of 3.1 reais to the dollar in mid-April.
In Argentina, the economic achievements of Macri’s team, which inherited a colossal mess from the Peronist Kirchner dynasty that preceded his administration, have been heroic.
Nonetheless, the current macroeconomic policy mix could be improved.
Given that concerns about reigniting growth seemed paramount, and that Argentina’s gross public debt, at some 50% of GDP (27% in net terms), is not particularly large, Macri cut taxes and allowed the primary deficit to rise from 4% of GDP in Cristina Fernández de Kirchner’s last year as president to 4.3% in 2016.
The official target for 2017 is 4.2%.
The government has been borrowing abroad to cover the shortfall (the overall fiscal deficit was nearly 6% of GDP in 2016).
Because Macri reached a settlement with Argentina’s holdout creditors from the sovereign default in 2001, the private sector also has been able to resume foreign borrowing.
The resulting capital inflows have strengthened the currency.
Inflation has fallen, but it remains high, despite a strong peso.
So the central bank hiked its short-term interest rate in April.
A tighter fiscal policy would enhance the credibility of the anti-inflation program.
Falling inflation would make room for a more expansionary monetary policy, allowing the currency to depreciate in real terms and stimulating exports and growth.
Sustained growth in Argentina can come only from the expansion of tradables.
Greater certainty that the real exchange rate will be competitive can help unlock investment in agribusiness (Argentina has some of the world’s most competitive natural conditions), energy, and import-competing manufactures.
Delivering that certainty will not be easy, because much of the primary deficit reflects remaining energy subsidies to households and firms; increasing these so-called administered prices (of electricity and natural gas, among others) causes a one-off jump in the relevant price indices, and a temporary spike in inflation.
The name of the game, then, is to persuade consumers that the rise in inflation will be temporary, and for that a credible and strong fiscal anchor is key.
So fiscal consolidation in Brazil would strengthen the currency, while in Argentina it would create room for a more competitive real exchange rate.
Both effects are good for growth – and that is only in the short run.
Despite the International Monetary Fund’s mea culpa for underestimating the short-run adverse effects of fiscal austerity on European growth, over the longer term, Fund studies make clear, “reducing government debt is likely to raise output, as real interest rates decline and the lighter burden of interest payments permits cuts to distortionary taxes.”
One does not have to stick to the controversial 90%-of-GDP threshold identified by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff to believe that a stronger fiscal position can help long-term growth – especially in perennially low-savings, high-interest economies like Brazil.
Argentina and Brazil are not Spain and Portugal.
If fiscal adjustment can create opportunities for growth, they should seize it.
Fiscal Fibs and Follies
BERKELEY – Across the globe, the debate over fiscal consolidation has the distinct sound of two sides talking past one another.
On one side are those who insist that governments must move now, at all cost, to rein in budget deficits.
Putting public finances on a sustainable footing, they argue, is essential to reassure financial markets.
If concerted efforts are taken to balance budgets, confidence will be bolstered. And if confidence is bolstered, consumption and investment will rise.
In this view, cutting deficits will be expansionary.
As evidence that this is not merely a hypothetical possibility, advocates of fiscal consolidation point to cases like Denmark in the early 1980’s, Ireland in the late 1980’s, and Finland in the 1990’s.
On the other side are those who insist that additional public spending is still needed to support demand.
Private spending remains weak, not least where continued high unemployment has led consumers, concerned about future prospects, to pocket their wallets.
Moreover, the critics object, the evidence in support of expansionary fiscal consolidations is flawed.
In each case where fiscal consolidation supposedly was expansionary, the economy grew because of some third factor.
Denmark grew, despite fiscal cuts, because interest rates, initially in the double digits, came down.
Ireland and Finland grew, despite fiscal cuts, because the exchange rate fell sharply, boosting exports.
The world economy today, desperate for demand, can’t count on either mechanism.
Interest rates in many countries are already near zero. And all countries can’t depreciate their exchange rates at the same time.
So who is right?
Consider the following image: consumers and investors as passengers in a car hurtling directly toward a brick wall. In this case, the driver stepping on the brake will give the passengers more confidence.
Here, the plausible passengers are southern European firms. They understand that their countries’ fiscal positions are unsustainable.
They know that debt default would be disruptive.
Seeing the economy hurtling toward a brick wall, they are holding their collective breath, while evidence that the government is serious about stepping on the brake can induce them to exhale.
In this case, fiscal consolidation is likely to affect their investment spending positively.
This does not mean that Greece, Portugal, and Spain will expand as robustly as Denmark, Ireland, and Finland did in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
They can’t lower the exchange rate to aid exports.
But they can reduce interest rates by eliminating the perceived risk of sovereign default. Banks will be able to borrow from one another for less, and thus able to lend to firms for less.
This suggests that investment may respond better than the pessimists fear.
But what might work in southern Europe has no chance of working elsewhere.
In other G-20 economies, including the United States, Germany, China, and Japan, the car is still cruising down an open road.
Fiscal velocity may be considerable – that is, deficits may be large – but there is no sign of a brick wall ahead.
Interest rates on government debt are still low.
If the passengers were growing restive, they would rise. At this point, they have not.
In these countries, there is therefore no reason to think that fiscal consolidation would have a strong positive effect on confidence.
That possibility could arise sometime in the future, when the proverbial brick wall comes into view.
But it is not on the horizon yet, which means that there would be no positive private-spending response to buffer public-spending cuts.
As a result, budget cuts would be strongly contractionary.
Finally there are borderline cases, like Britain.
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne insists that his country’s fiscal trajectory is dangerously unsustainable, and he has proposed draconian cuts.
Others strongly disagree, noting the continued low level of interest rates, and that even under the previous government’s plan, net borrowing costs were already scheduled to fall by nearly two-thirds between 2010-11 and 2014-15.
It is almost as if governments like Britain’s are attempting to manipulate the private sector into believing that the dire conditions required for an expansionary fiscal consolidation have already been met.
It as if they are trying to terrorize the private sector, so that when the fiscal ax actually falls, consumers and investors will be sufficiently relieved that disaster has been averted that they will increase spending.
If so, leaders are playing a dangerous game that depends on encouraging more future spending by exciting consumers and investors now, while depressing actual spending just when it is most urgently needed.
Or maybe politicians don’t believe any of this and are simply intent on cutting spending for ideological reasons, irrespective of the economic consequences.
But who would be so cynical as to believe that?
Fiscal Follies in America and Beyond
Those of us who know that long-run fiscal imbalances are likely to end in disaster – high inflation, deep recession, financial crisis, or all three – scratch our heads in bemusement at the priorities of George W. Bush and his administration.
The Social Security “crisis” that he wants to spend his political capital on “resolving” ranks no higher than third among America’s fiscal problems in urgency and seriousness – and at a time when these problems have grown into a profound threat to global economic stability.
America’s gravest fiscal problem is the short- and medium-run deficit between tax revenues and spending.
This deficit is entirely of Bush’s own creation, having enacted – and now seeking to extend – tax cuts that are not cuts at all, because they merely shift the burden of fiscal consolidation onto future generations.
The second most serious problem is the looming long-term explosion in the costs of America’s health care programs.
This is also partly Bush’s doing, or, rather, not doing, as his first-term policy on health spending was to do virtually nothing to encourage efficiency and cost containment.
Instead, he enacted a Medicare drug benefit that promises to spend enormous amounts of money for surprisingly little in the way of better health care.
Surely a more competent administration would be worried about addressing these more severe and urgent fiscal problems.
Let’s pretend that the United States had such a government. What would it do?
Dealing with the short- and medium-run deficit would be fairly straightforward: decide how large a share of GDP the federal government should take up, set spending at that level, and set taxes so that the budget is balanced (or so that the debt-to-GDP ratio is not growing) over the business cycle.
Determine whether, overall, you would rather have in the medium term a federal government that spends, say, 16%, 20%, or 24% of GDP – and on what.
What is not straightforward is how to address the imminent explosion of health-care costs.
In fact, projections of rapidly rising Medicare and Medicaid spending in the US – and similarly rapidly-rising governmental health care expenditures elsewhere in the developed world – are not so such a problem to be solved as the side effects of an opportunity to be grasped.
The opportunity stems from the fact that our doctors and nurses, our pharmacists and drug researchers, our biologists and biochemists are learning to do wonderful things.
Many of these things are, and will be, expensive.
Many of them will also be desirable: longer, healthier, and higher quality lives as we learn more about the details of human biology.
Federal health-care spending will grow very rapidly over the next two generations because the things that health care money will be spent on will be increasingly wonderful, and increasingly valued.
But it will be difficult to grasp fully this opportunity.
It is highly likely that desired health expenditures will be enormous for some things and trivial for others.
This calls for insurance.
The problem is that private insurance markets do not work well when the buyer knows much more about what is being insured than the seller.
Obviously, one’s health is an area in which private information can be very private indeed.
This is, of course, why state-run health-care systems came into being.
But replacing private insurance with public insurance has its own problems: consider the parlous circumstances in which Britain’s National Health System finds itself, the result of generations of politically driven underinvestment in health care.
Moreover, the overall level of spending is likely to be large.
That means that without (and even with) state-run health-care systems, the rich will be able to afford more and better care than the poor.
To what extent do we accept a world where the non-rich die in situations in which the rich would live?
To what extent do we hold on to our belief that when it comes to saving lives, medical care should be distributed on the basis of patients’ needs, not their wealth?
Where and how would we tax the resources to put real weight behind egalitarian principles?
Sharply rising health-care costs will probably confront governments throughout the developed world with the biggest economic policy issues they will face over the next two generations.
The Bush administration has yet to realize this, but other governments are not thinking hard enough, either.
At best, they are seeking ways to keep health-care spending from rising, as though the genie of medical progress can be forced back into the bottle.
Instead, governments should embrace the promise of wonderful innovations in health care, and ask how fast spending should rise, and how that rise should be financed.
Fiscal Follies
NEW YORK – The fiscal stimulus that most advanced economies and emerging markets implemented during the 2008-2009 global recession – together with monetary easing and the backstopping of the financial system – prevented the Great Recession from turning into another Great Depression in 2010.
At a time when every component of private demand was collapsing, the boost from higher government spending and lower taxes stopped the global economy’s free-fall and created the basis for recovery.
Unfortunately, stimulus spending and the related bailout of the financial system, together with the recession’s effect on revenues, contributed to fiscal deficits on the order of 10% of GDP in most advanced economies.
According to the International Monetary Fund and others, these economies’ ratio of public debt to GDP will surpass 110% by 2015, compared to 70% before the crisis.
Aging populations in most advanced economies imply additional public debt in the long term, owing to non-fully-funded pension schemes and rising health-care costs.
Thus, in most advanced economies, deficits need to be reduced to avoid a fiscal train wreck down the line.
But much research, including a recent study by the IMF, suggests that raising taxes and reducing government spending has a negative short-term effect on aggregate demand, thereby reinforcing deflationary and recessionary trends – and undermining fiscal consolidation.
In an ideal world, where policymakers could credibly commit to medium- to long-term fiscal adjustment, the optimal and desirable path would be to commit today to a schedule of spending reductions and tax increases, phased in gradually over the next decade as the economy recovers.
That way, if the economy needed another targeted fiscal stimulus in the short run, financial markets would not respond by driving up borrowing costs.
Unfortunately, the fiscal policy currently adopted by various advanced economies deviates sharply from this path of credible medium-term consolidation combined with short-term additional stimulus.
In the US, we have the worst of all possible worlds.
On one hand, stimulus had become a dirty word – even within the Obama administration – well before the Republicans’ mid-term election victory ruled out another round altogether.
On the other hand, medium-term consolidation will be all but impossible in America’s current atmosphere of hyper-partisanship, with Republicans blocking any tax increase and Democrats resisting reforms of entitlement spending.
Nor is there any pressure from bond markets to concentrate the minds of policymakers.
In the periphery of the eurozone, the problem is the opposite: bond vigilantes are demanding that Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy front-load fiscal consolidation or watch their borrowing costs go through the roof, risking them their market access and triggering a public-debt crisis.
Markets don’t care that front-loaded fiscal consolidation is exacerbating recession and thus making the goal of reducing debt and deficits as a share of GDP near-impossible to achieve.
To avoid a persistent and destructive recession, the fiscal and structural reforms imposed by the bond vigilantes should be accompanied by other euro-zone policies that restore growth and prevent vicious debt dynamics.
The European Central Bank should ease monetary policy in order to weaken the value of the euro and bootstrap the periphery’s growth.
And Germany should cut taxes temporarily – rather than raising taxes, as planned – in order to increase disposable income and stimulate German demand for the periphery’s goods and services.
Alas, neither of the two biggest players in the euro zone is pursuing policies consistent with restoring sustained growth in the euro zone’s periphery.
The ECB’s monetary policy is too tight; and Germany is front-loading fiscal austerity.
Thus, the periphery is destined to a destructive deflationary and recessionary adjustment that will exacerbate the risks of recession, insolvency, eventual defaults and, possibly, exit from the euro.
In the United Kingdom, the new government gave several reasons for front-loading fiscal consolidation.
The bond vigilantes might have woken up if early austerity was not implemented; the deficit was very large and the public sector bloated; and it is always politically easier to implement tough measures early in an administration, when popular support is still high and the next election is far off.
Certainly, the UK was playing with fiscal fire and needed some commitment to earlier austerity.
But phasing in austerity more gradually, and thus back-loading the adjustment, would have posed less risk to the economy’s anemic recovery while maintaining a credible commitment to fiscal consolidation.
Instead, the government could well end up with no plan B in case plan A – massively front-loaded austerity – leads to a double-dip recession.
In short, an optimal path of fiscal austerity would, in most countries, imply a back-loaded but credible commitment to medium-term consolidation, together with short-term additional stimulus when necessary and allowed by market conditions, thereby avoiding the prospect of a deflationary and recessionary spiral.
Unfortunately, the main advanced economies are following a divergent path – which, in some cases, will lead them in the opposite direction in 2011.
As a result, the risks of debt deflation and eventual disorderly sovereign and private-sector defaults are rising.
Europe’s Fiscal Wormhole
BRUSSELS – The International Monetary Fund now estimates a 30% risk of deflation in the eurozone, and growth figures within the monetary union continue to disappoint.
But policymakers seem trapped in a cat’s cradle of economic, political, and legal constraints that is preventing effective action.
The fulfillment of policy rules appears to be impossible without growth, but growth appears to be impossible without breaking the rules.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble is politically committed to outdoing his country’s tough domestic fiscal framework to secure what he calls a “black zero” budget.
The French government is working to regain credibility on reform promises made in exchange for delays on fiscal adjustment, and Italy, with one of the highest debt burdens in the eurozone, has little room to use fiscal policy.
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is constrained by doubts about the legality of its “outright monetary transactions” (OMT) scheme – sovereign-bond purchases that could result in a redistributive fiscal policy.
With all of the rules pointing toward recession, how can Europe boost recovery?
A two-year €400 billion ($510 billion) public-investment program, financed with European Investment Bank bonds, would be the best way to overcome Europe’s current impasse.
Borrowing by the EIB has no implications in terms of European fiscal rules.
It is recorded neither as new debt nor as a deficit for any of the member states, which means that new government spending could be funded without affecting national fiscal performance.
Thus, some of the investment spending currently planned at the national level could be financed via European borrowing to relieve national budgets.
Such an indirect way of dealing with strict rules would also be easier than starting long and wearying negotiations on changes to the fiscal framework.
The EIB is worried that such a scheme could come at the cost of its triple-A rating.
Indeed, though it can currently borrow at 1.6% on a long maturity, it has used its recent capital-raising exercise to reduce leverage rather than substantially increase its loan portfolio, as would be warranted at a time of retrenchment in private lending.
In any case, a rating change would hardly affect funding costs in the current low-yield environment, as lower-rated sovereigns have demonstrated.
In addition, the ECB could purchase EIB bonds on secondary markets, which would help to keep funding costs low – or even reduce them.
More important, purchases of EIB bonds would enable the ECB to undertake quantitative easing without triggering the degree of controversy implied by intervening in 18 separate sovereign-bond markets, where concerns that ECB purchases would affect the relative pricing of sovereigns are very real.
Already, €200 billion of EIB bonds are available.
Adding €400 billion would increase the pool substantially.
Together with asset-backed securities, covered bonds, and corporate bonds, €1 trillion of assets – the threshold widely thought to make quantitative easing by the ECB credible – would be available for purchase.
A central question, of course, concerns the type of government spending that should qualify as investment spending, and which European investment projects should be supported.
It will be impossible to define new and sensible European projects worth €200 billion per year.
Common projects such as the European energy union will need more time to be precisely defined.
As a result, the bulk of investment now will have to come from national policymakers.
In part, this means that existing infrastructure projects that are supposed to be financed from national budgets could be funded by the EIB.
By removing some of the burden from national budgets, the current decline in public investment could be reversed.
Some of the new resources could also be used to allow for budget consolidation in France without pro-cyclical cuts.
France could get this helping hand in complying with the fiscal rules in exchange for serious and necessary structural reforms, as could Italy, where EIB-funded bonds would provide a much-needed growth stimulus without new government commitments.
In Germany, the freed-up resources could be used to accelerate existing investment projects while still meeting its black-zero pledge.
Similar arrangements could be found for the other eurozone countries.
To prevent the misuse of money, the European Commission should vet all national investment projects.
More broadly, the program would be an important step toward establishing the eurozone’s missing fiscal union.
That goal will be reached more quickly once the benefits of achieving it are apparent to all.
The Promise of Fiscal Money
ATHENS – Western capitalism has few sacred cows left.
It is time to question one of them: the independence of central banks from elected governments.
The rationale for entrusting monetary policy fully to central banks is well understood: politicians, overly tempted during the electoral cycle to create more money, pose a threat to economic stability.
While progressives have always protested that central banks can never be truly independent, because their autonomy from elected officials increases their dependence on the financiers they are meant to keep in check, the argument in favor of removing monetary policy from democratic politics has prevailed since the 1970s.
Setting aside the political controversy, central bank independence is predicated on an economic axiom: that money and debt (or credit) are strictly separable.
Debt – for example, a government or corporate bond that is bought and sold for a price that is a function of inflation and default risk – can be traded domestically.
Money, on the other hand, cannot default and is a means, rather than an object, of exchange (the currency market notwithstanding).
But this axiom no longer holds.
With the rise of financialization, commercial banks have become increasingly reliant on one another for short-term loans, mostly backed by government bonds, to finance their daily operations.
This liquidity acquires familiar properties: used as a means of exchange and as a store of value, it becomes a form of money.
And there’s the rub: as banks issue more inter-bank money, the financial system requires more government bonds to back the increase.
The growing inter-bank money supply fuels demand for government debt, in a never-ending cycle that generates tides of liquidity over which central banks have little control.
In this brave new financial world, central banks’ independence is becoming meaningless, because the money they create represents a shrinking share of the total money supply.
With the rise of inter-bank money, backed mostly by government debt, fiscal policy has become an essential factor in determining the quantity of actual money lubricating modern capitalism.
Indeed, the more independent a central bank is, the greater the role of fiscal policy in determining the quantity of money in an economy.
For example, in the eurozone, Germany’s tight fiscal policy is creating a shortage of bunds (German government bonds), which is limiting both the European Central Bank’s capacity to implement its quantitative easing policy and commercial banks’ ability to produce more inter-bank money.
Money and government debt are now so intertwined that the analytical basis for central bank autonomy has disappeared.
Of course, any attempt to bring treasuries and central banks back under one roof would expose politicians to accusations of trying to get their grubby hands on the levers of monetary policy.
But another response to the new reality is available: Leave central banks alone, but give governments a greater say in domestic money creation – and, indeed, greater independence from the central bank – by establishing a parallel payments system based on fiscal money or, more precisely, money backed by future taxes.
How would fiscal money work?
For starters, it would “live” on the tax authority’s digital platform, using the existing tax file numbers of individuals and companies.
Anyone with a tax file number (TFN) in some country receives a free account linked to their TFN.
Individuals and firms will then be able to add credit to their TFN-linked account by transferring money from their normal bank account, in the same way that they do today to pay their taxes.
And they will do so well in advance of tax payments because the state guarantees to extinguish in, say, a year €1,080 ($1,289) of the tax owed for every €1,000 transferred today – an effective annual interest rate of 8% payable to those willing to pay their taxes a year early.
In practice, once, say, €1,000 has been transferred to one’s TFN-linked account, a personal identification number (the familiar PIN) is issued, which can be used either to transfer the €1,000 credit to someone else’s TFN-linked account or to pay taxes in the future.
These time-stamped future tax euros, or fiscal euros, can be held for a year until maturity or be used to make payments to other taxpayers.
Smartphone apps and even government-issued cards (doubling as, say, social security ID) will make the transactions easy, fast, and virtually indistinguishable from other transactions involving central bank money.
In this closed payments system, as fiscal money approaches maturity, taxpayers not in possession of that vintage will fuel rising demand for it.
To ensure the system’s viability, the Treasury would control the total supply of fiscal money, using the effective interest rate to guarantee that the nominal value of the total supply never exceeds a percentage of national income, or of aggregate taxes, agreed by the legislature.
To ensure full transparency, and thus trust, a blockchain algorithm, designed and supervised by an independent national authority, could settle transactions in fiscal money.
The advantages of fiscal money are legion.
It would provide a source of liquidity for governments, bypassing the bond markets.
It would limit the extent to which government borrowing fuels inter-bank money creation, or at least force financiers to tie up some of their inter-bank money in the closed, domestic fiscal money system, thereby minimizing shocks from sudden capital flight.
And, by competing with the banks’ payment system, it would reduce the cost of fees customers currently pay.
Indeed, owing to the blockchain technology, fiscal money constitutes a fully transparent, transaction-cost-free, public payment system monitored jointly by every citizen (and non-citizen) who participates in it.
Fiscal money is politically attractive as well.
Governments could use any slack in money supply to top up the FTN-linked accounts of families in need, or to pay for public works, making it appealing to progressives.
And conservatives should be encouraged by a system that promises significant tax relief for those who help the government create fiscal money, without impinging on the central bank’s role in setting interest rates.
The potential transnational advantages of fiscal money are also significant.
For example, fiscal money would have helped Greece resist our creditors’ encroachments in 2015, and it was at the heart of my plan for dealing with a predatory bank holiday enforced by the ECB at the end of that June.
Today, it would give Italy, France, and other eurozone members much needed fiscal space, and possibly provide a foundation for a revamped eurozone with interlocking domestic fiscal euros, rather than parallel currencies, playing a stabilizing macroeconomic role.
And then, perhaps, it could become the basis for a New Bretton Woods, functioning like an overarching clearing union of many different fiscal money systems.
The Quiet Demise of Austerity
LONDON – It has been several years since policymakers seriously discussed the merits of fiscal austerity.
Debates about the potential advantages of using stimulus to boost short-term economic growth, or about the threat of government debt reaching such a level as to inhibit medium-term growth, have gone silent.
There is no mistaking which side won, and why.
Austerity is dead.
And as conventional politicians continue to take rearguard action against populist upstarts, they will likely embrace more fiscal-policy easing – or at least avoid tightening – to reap near-certain short-term economic gains.
At the same time, they are not likely to heed warnings of the medium-term consequences of higher debt levels, given widespread talk of interest rates remaining “lower for longer.”
One way to confirm that an international fiscal-policy consensus has emerged is to review policymakers’ joint statements.
The last time the G7 issued a communiqué noting the importance of fiscal consolidation was at the Lough Erne Summit in 2013, when it was still the G8.
Since then, joint statements have contained amorphous proposals to implement “fiscal strategies flexibly to support growth” and ensure that debt-to-GDP ratios are sustainable.
Putting debt on a sustainable path presumably means that it will not increase without interruption.
But in the absence of a definite timeframe, debt levels can undergo lengthy deviations, the sustainability of which is open to interpretation.
Objections to austerity were understandable in the period following the 2008 financial crisis.
Fiscal policy was being tightened when growth was languishing below 2% (after bouncing back in 2010), and sizeable negative output gaps suggested that overall employment would be slow to recover.
In late 2012, at the peak of the post-crisis austerity debate, advanced economies were in the midst of a multi-year tightening equivalent to more than one percentage point of GDP annually, according to cyclically-adjusted primary balance data from the International Monetary Fund.
But just as fiscal policy was being tightened when cyclical economic conditions seemed to call for easing, it is now being eased when conditions seem to call for tightening.
The output gap in advanced economies has all but disappeared, inflation is picking up, and world economic growth is forecast to be its strongest since 2010.
In 2013, Japan was the only advanced economy to loosen fiscal policy.
But this year, the United Kingdom appears to be the only one preparing to tighten its policy – and that is assuming recent political ruptures haven’t altered its fiscal orientation, which will be reflected in the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Autumn Statement.
Most observers would agree that government debt levels are uncomfortably high in many advanced economies, so it would be prudent for policymakers to discuss strategies for bringing them down.
Moreover, there are several options for doing this, some of which are easier or more effective than others.
In the end, government deleveraging is about the relationship between economic growth and interest rates.
The higher the growth rate relative to interest rates, the lower the level of fiscal consolidation needed to stabilize or reduce debt as a share of GDP.
As economic growth continues to pick up while interest rates lag, at least outside the US, fiscal authorities will have further opportunities to reduce debt, and create fiscal space for stimulus measures when the next cyclical downturn inevitably arrives.
But policymakers are not doing this, which suggests that they have prioritized largely political considerations over fiscal prudence.
After the recent elections in the Netherlands and France, a growing chorus is now proclaiming that “peak populism” has passed.
But one could argue just as easily that populist ideals are being absorbed into more mainstream political and economic agendas.
As a result, politicians, particularly in Europe, have no choice but to favor inclusive growth policies and scrutinize the potential impact that a given policy could have on the income distribution.
This political environment is hardly conducive to fiscal consolidation.
Any tax increases or spending cuts will have to be designed exceptionally well – perhaps impossibly so – for leaders to avoid a populist backlash.
Some people will always lose more than others from fiscal consolidation, and deciding who those people are is never a pleasant exercise.
So far, those decisions are being delayed on political grounds.
But the economic implications of high government debt cannot be ignored forever.
Monetary policy is already starting to change in the US, and it could be on the verge of changing globally.
One way or another, fiscal authorities will have to confront challenging tradeoffs in the years ahead.
A Balance-Sheet Approach to Fiscal Policy
WASHINGTON, DC – Everyone is talking about debt, citing huge nominal figures that strongly affect public-policy debates worldwide.
But all debt is not created equal.
For starters, when it comes to public debt, there is a big difference between the gross and net figures.
While Japan’s gross public debt, for example, is a massive 246% of GDP, the net figure, accounting for intra-government debts, is 127% of GDP.
Moreover, what should really matter about a country’s public-debt burden is the expected annual cost of servicing it.
As Daniel Gros recently pointed out, debt that can be rolled over indefinitely at zero interest rates is no debt at all.
This is an extreme example; but the closer a fixed interest rate gets to zero, and the longer the maturity becomes, the lower the burden of the stock of debt.
Although Greece’s public debt amounts to about 175% of GDP, low interest rates – which are fixed for a large proportion of it – and long maturities mean that it may be more manageable than it seems.
Greece’s ratio of public-debt service to GDP is similar to that of Portugal, or even Italy.
Indeed, that is why the latest deal with Greece, which entails even more bailout funds, could work, as long as the country is accorded the debt reprofiling that it needs to reverse the decline of its GDP, reduces its primary surpluses, and pursues balance-sheet-strengthening reforms.
Such considerations underscore why it is a mistake to focus only on annual budgets, without adequate regard for the long-term balance-sheet implications of how borrowed money is used.
This narrow, short-term focus differs from the approach taken for publicly traded companies, for which the strength of the balance sheet and the economy’s potential are emphasized, alongside annual income statements.
Imagine, for example, that Germany borrows at a 1% fixed real interest rate with a ten-year maturity and invests the proceeds in repairing domestic transport infrastructure.
These investments bring a modest real financial rate of return of 4% through fees, tolls, and, in the longer run, tax revenues (stemming from an increase in GDP).
Such investments would directly strengthen Germany’s public-sector balance sheet.
This does not even take into account social returns, accrued through reduced traffic congestion and cleaner air.
Beyond infrastructure, spending to improve education – specifically to ensure that the next generation receives the skills they need to contribute to the twenty-first-century economy – would also result in faster GDP growth. And it, too, would likely yield significant social returns.
For governments with access to today’s extremely low – and often negative – real interest rates, it may seem like a no-brainer to borrow and invest more in projects with long-term benefits.
Doing so would strengthen their balance sheets, crowd in the private sector, and generate employment.
But balance-sheet calculations are rarely at the center of political debate.
To be sure, some progress is being made toward bringing longer-term considerations into annual budget rules.
Bodies like the European Commission increasingly distinguish between the structural and cyclical components of a budget deficit, and thus consider potential output, which increases with investment, in their calculations.
But this is only a small step in the right direction.
For a long-term balance-sheet approach to gain traction, politicians will have to drop the ideological biases that are distorting fiscal policy.
Proponents of austerity currently use nominal debt figures to scare voters, even in countries with record-low interest rates and large private-sector profits that are not being channeled toward investment.
To counter their arguments, opinion-makers should emphasize the expected long-term returns on incremental public investment, not with ideological arguments, but with concrete examples from various sectors in the recent past that have had reasonably good rate of returns.
Of course, as the economist Charles Wyplosz has explained, debt sustainability analysis is inherently uncertain.
But some needs can reasonably be anticipated.
Amid massive unmet demand for new climate-compatible infrastructure and for workers with modern skillsets, any semi-competent government should be able to demonstrate the likelihood of significant real returns on incremental investment.
In many countries, one could realistically expect a 4% average return on at least one percentage point of GDP worth of incremental investment.
If the marginal real interest rate is 1%, an increase in public investment would actually reduce future indebtedness.
Of course, it is possible for too large of an increase to put pressure on real interest rates, thereby crowding out potential private investment.
If there is significant exchange-rate risk, such as in non-reserve currency countries, that, too, should be taken into account.
Current fiscal-policy debates should not focus on simplistic headline numbers.
To strengthen public accounts, both conservatives and progressives should start promoting a long-term balance-sheet-oriented approach to policymaking, ensuring that the debates are based on relevant data.
Otherwise, the wrong policies – and, with them, anemic GDP growth and sluggish job creation – will continue to prevail.
Fishy Conservation Efforts
NAIROBI – If you happen to be a salamander known as the Iranian Kaiser spotted newt, chances are that things may be looking up.
Governments at the recent meeting in Doha of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) voted for a trade ban on Iranian Kaisers, alongside tougher protection for a host of land-living creatures.
But if you are a blue-fin tuna of the western Atlantic stock, your mood will be decidedly more pessimistic.
It is a similar story for several species of shark, including the oceanic white-tip, scalloped hammerhead, and the great and spiny dogfish.
Despite strong scientific evidence showing sharp declines in the populations of all three, every proposal for tougher trade controls on these marine species – along with more than 30 species of coral – failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority.
In the case of the western Atlantic stock of blue-fin tuna, several countries argued that the existing management body – the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) – is best placed to manage the stock.
Others who proposed tougher trade rules were not convinced – and with good reason.
Stocks of this highly prized fish have declined by up to 80% since the dawn of industrialized fishing, and this has been on ICCAT’s watch.
In the case of sharks and rays, a recent survey indicates that close to one-third of the 64 ocean-living species are on the verge of extinction.
Their decline is linked to over-exploitation of other once-common species.
For example, spiny dogfish is partly substituting for cod in many European fish-and-chip shops.
Sharks, too, are suffering from rapidly rising demand for shark-fin soup, which is considered a delicacy in many parts of Asia.
But saving endangered and near-endangered species is not just about conservation; it is also about defending millions of people’s livelihoods, which depend on healthy oceans.
Today’s marine environment is truly under siege.
When the explorer John Cabot sailed off the coast of Newfoundland more than 500 years ago, vast shoals of cod slowed down his ships; crews could lower buckets over the side and fill them with fish.
By 1992, however, over-fishing had forced the total closure of this once highly productive fishery, and, despite all efforts, Newfoundland’s Grand Banks has never recovered.
Similarly, over-fishing of sharks in the Caribbean has triggered a rise in octopus and a drastic drop in spiny lobsters and scallops – two major sources of revenue for neighboring coastal communities.
The outcome at CITES has brought into sharp relief increasing tensions between industrial and environmental interests, as if these were diametrically opposed.
Surely a twenty-first-century fisherman does not want to see the basis of his or her living degraded and destroyed, nor does a modern conservationist want to ring-fence the environment and stop people from making a living.
So if governments want existing agreements to rule the waves, they must start acting on the sobering science and real-world numbers.
For example, with respect to sharks, existing sanctions against “finning” under Regional Fisheries Management Organizations should be enforced, backed up by an independent system of on-board observers to ensure that trawlers comply.
Moreover, an international action plan for sharks, including a ceiling on catches, should be created.
And proper fishing methods that catch only target species should be used, with others caught accidentally as so-called by-catch returned to the sea alive.
Where fisheries agreements are not succeeding, conservation agreements must be tried and applied.
After all, these are not competing regulatory regimes, but complimentary ones.
In the case of the western Atlantic blue-fin tuna, the ball is now firmly back in ICCAT’s court.
Governments that support the ICCAT option must now prove that it is up to the job.
They have three years to do so, before CITES next meets in Thailand.
If there is no dramatic action and improvement, governments should instead give CITES, as a well established conservation and trade agreement, a chance to reverse the species’ current plight.
Blue-fin tuna is heading for commercial, if not outright, extinction, as are a host of other economically and ecologically important marine species.
They are swimming in the last-chance lagoon.
But so, too, could be the organizations that have presided over a breathtaking collapse of so many fisheries and left a once-bountiful marine environment – and the lives and livelihoods of many fishermen – damaged and degraded in their wake.
China’s Rebalancing Act
BEIJING – China’s 12th Five-Year Plan calls for a shift in the country’s economic model from export-led growth toward greater reliance on domestic demand, particularly household consumption.
Since the Plan’s introduction, China’s current-account surplus as a share of GDP has indeed fallen.
But does that mean that China’s adjustment is on track?
According to the IMF, the fall in China’s current-account surplus/GDP ratio has largely been the result of very high levels of investment, a weak global environment, and an increase in prices for commodity imports that has outpaced the rise in prices for Chinese manufactured goods.
So the fall in China’s external surplus/GDP ratio does not represent economic “rebalancing”; on the contrary, the Fund predicts that the ratio will rebound in 2013 and approach its pre-crisis level thereafter.
The IMF’s explanation of the recent fall in China’s current-account surplus/GDP ratio is broadly correct.
Experience suggests that China’s external position is highly sensitive to global conditions, with the surplus/GDP ratio rising during boom times for the world economy and falling during slumps.
Europe’s malaise has hit China’s exports badly, and undoubtedly is the most important factor underlying the current decline in the ratio.
By definition, without a change in the saving gap, there will be no change in the trade surplus, and vice versa.
Furthermore, the saving gap and the trade balance interact with each other constantly, making them always equal.
In response to the global financial crisis in 2008, China introduced a RMB4 trillion ($634 billion) stimulus package.
While the increase in investment reduced the saving/GDP ratio, the resulting increase in imports lowered the trade surplus/GDP ratio. As a result, China’s external surplus/GDP ratio fell significantly in 2009.
In 2010, China’s government adjusted its economic policy.
In order to control inflation and real-estate bubbles, the central bank tightened monetary policy and the government refrained from another round of fiscal stimulus.
China’s real-estate investment accounted for 10% of GDP, and slower investment growth in the sector necessarily reduces import demand, directly and indirectly.
But, because the fall in import growth had yet to turn into a rout, while China’s exports to Europe plummeted, China’s current-account surplus fell further in GDP terms in 2011.
This situation is likely to change in 2012.
The negative impact of the fall in real-estate investment since 2010 has been deeper and longer than expected; indeed, almost all categories of imports that fell by 10% or more in August were related to real-estate investment.
As a result, it is possible that the fall in investment growth will reverse the declining external surplus/GDP ratio in 2012, unless the global economy deteriorates further and/or the Chinese government launches a new stimulus package.
Perhaps most important, China must now export more manufactured goods to finance imports of energy and mineral products.
The worsening terms of trade have been a major factor contributing to the decline in the current-account surplus in recent years.
Nevertheless, despite the merits of its analysis, the IMF underestimates China’s progress in rebalancing.
In my view, China’s rebalancing is more genuine – and more fundamental – than the Fund recognizes, and the prediction of an eventual rebound in China’s external surplus/GDP ratio will most likely turn out to be wrong.
First, the roughly 30% real exchange-rate appreciation since 2005 must have had a serious impact on exporters, reflected in the bankruptcy – as well as the upgrading – of many enterprises in coastal areas.
Though the market shares of Chinese exports seem to have held up quite well, this is attributable to price-cutting in foreign markets, which is not sustainable.
Over time, real exchange-rate appreciation will cause a shift in expenditure, making China’s rebalancing more apparent.
Second, China’s wage levels are rising rapidly.
According to the 12th Five-Year Plan, the minimum wage should grow by 13% per year.
Together with real appreciation, the increase in labor costs is bound to weaken the competitiveness of China’s labor-intensive export sector, which will be reflected in the trade balance more clearly in the coming years.
Third, China has made significant progress in building its social-security system.
The number of people covered by basic old-age insurance, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, and maternity insurance has risen substantially.
Moreover, universal medical insurance is emerging, and a comprehensive system for providing aid to students from poor families has been established.
As a result, the motivation for precautionary saving has been weakened somewhat, while some researchers have found statistical evidence that the consumption rate is rising, which is supported by China’s emergence as the world’s fourth-largest importer of luxury goods.
Finally, the worsening of China’s terms of trade will play an even more fundamental role in reducing its trade surplus in the future.
Given weak demand, which may be prolonged, Chinese exporters must accept increasingly thin profit margins to maintain market share.
However, China’s large size and low per capita income and capital stock imply continued rapid growth in its demand for commodities.
Thanks to supply constraints, China’s import bill for commodities and metals is likely to offset its processing-trade surplus in the near future.
In short, as long as China’s government is not so unnerved by the slowdown in output growth that it changes its current policy stance, the current-account surplus is more likely to continue to fall relative to GDP than it is to rebound in 2013 and thereafter.
In fact, such an outcome is not only likely, but also desirable.
After all, faced with “infinite quantitative easing,” being a large net creditor means being in the worst position in today’s global economy.
Lehman’s Morbid Legacy
NEWPORT BEACH – As the fifth anniversary of the disorderly collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers approaches, some analysts will revisit the causes of an historic global “sudden stop” that resulted in enormous economic and financial disruptions.
Others will describe the consequences of an event that continues to produce considerable human suffering.
And some will share personal experiences of a terrifying time for the global economy and for them personally (as policymakers, financial-market participants, and in their everyday lives).
As interesting as these contributions will be, I hope that we will also see another genre: analyses of the previously unthinkable outcomes that have become reality – with profound implications for current and future generations – and that our systems of governance have yet to address properly.
With this in mind, let me offer four.
The first such outcome, and by far the most consequential, is the continuing difficulty that Western economies face in generating robust economic growth and sufficient job creation.
Notwithstanding the initial sharp drop in GDP in the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, too many Western economies have yet to rebound properly, let alone sustain growth rates that would make up fully for lost jobs and income.
More generally, only a few have decisively overcome the trifecta of maladies that the crisis exposed: inadequate and unbalanced aggregate demand, insufficient structural resilience and agility, and persistent debt overhangs.
The net result goes beyond the weak growth, worsening income inequality, high long-term unemployment, and alarming youth joblessness of the here and now.
Five years after the global financial crisis, too many countries are being held back by exhausted and out-dated growth engines.
As a result, prospects for a rapid, durable, and inclusive economic recovery remain a serious concern.
Given this harsh reality, it is not surprising that the second previously unthinkable outcome concerns inadequate policy responses – namely, the large and persistent imbalance between the hyperactivity of central banks and the frustrating passivity of other policymakers.
The big surprise here is not that central banks acted decisively and boldly when financial markets froze and economic activity plummeted.
Given their relatively unrestricted access to the printing press and their high degree of operational autonomy, one would expect central banks to be active and effective first responders.
And they responded in an impressive and globally coordinated fashion.
What is surprising is that, five years after the crisis, and four years after disrupted financial markets resumed their normal functioning, Western economies still overwhelmingly rely on central banks to avoid even worse economic performance.
This has pushed central banks away from their core competencies as they have been forced to use partial and imperfect policy tools for quite a long time.
This outcome reflects domestic political polarization in the United States and the complexity of regional interactions in Europe, which have blocked comprehensive and balanced policy approaches.
To appreciate the extent of the problem, consider the repeated failure of the US Congress to pass an annual budget (let alone deliver medium-term reforms) or incomplete eurozone-wide initiatives at a time of alarming unemployment and residual threats of financial disruptions.
Such political dysfunction has undermined the responsiveness of other policymaking entities, including those that possess better tools than central banks.
This has compelled central bankers to remain in the policy forefront, building one bridge extension after another as they wait for other policymakers to get their act together.
The result has been to expose Western economies to ever-more experimental measures, with considerable uncertainty about the longer-term impact of operating sophisticated market-based systems on the basis of artificial constructs.
The third previously unthinkable outcome relates to how developing countries have fared.
Having initially suffered from the financial crisis as much as Western countries did (indeed, more in terms of output and trade), these historically less-robust economies staged a remarkable comeback – so much so that they became the engine of global growth.
In the process, however, they slipped into an unbalanced policy mix that now threatens their continued growth and financial stability.
Renewed risks of financial instability point to the fourth and final surprise: the failure to recast major contributors to the crisis in a credible, sustainable, and socially responsible manner.
Consider large Western banks.
Given their systemic importance, many were bailed out and, with continued official support, returned to profitability quite quickly.
Yet they were not subject to windfall profit taxation, nor have policymakers sufficiently altered structural incentives that encourage excessive risk-taking.
In the case of Europe, only now are banks being pushed to deal decisively with their capital shortfalls, leverage problems, and residual weak assets.
Call me a worrywart, but I remain concerned by the extent to which our systems of economic governance have lagged in addressing these four outcomes.
The longer this unusual environment persists, the greater the risk that the disruptive ramifications of the 2008 crisis will continue to reach far and wide, including to future generations.
Fixing Fixed-Investment Incentives
LONDON – Back in February, I noted that the global economy at the end of 2016 was in a stronger cyclical position than most people had expected, given the political upheavals of the previous 12 months.
That upward momentum carried through to the first quarter of 2017.
According to the latest “nowcast”-type indicators, world GDP growth is exceeding 4% – perhaps the strongest performance seen since before the 2008 financial crisis.
Still, some observers – and not just chronic pessimists – have countered that the evidence remains anecdotal, and that it is impossible to predict how long the current economic moment will last.
Indeed, there have been other periods in the long post-2008 recovery when growth returned, only to peter out quickly and become sluggish again.
To bolster long-term economic growth, business investment will have to increase.
Unfortunately, this is easier said than done.
In Western economies in particular, non-residential fixed investment is precisely the factor that was missing in previous, short-lived cycles of acceleration.
No one can say for sure why non-residential business investment has failed to recover in recent years.
But I suspect that the slightly pessimistic conventional wisdom on this question is wrong.
The conventional argument asserts that wary CEOs have come to see long-term risks as “just not worth it.”
The many uncertainties they face include concerns about excessive regulation, burdensome corporate taxation, high debt levels, erratic policymaking, the political backlash against globalization, and doubts that consumer spending outside (or even within) the United States will last.
A less pessimistic view holds that, after 2008, it became inevitable that the global economy would unhitch itself from the US consumer engine and adjust to the rise of emerging consumer economies, not least China.
When that happens, we can all live happily ever after.
I tend to side with this less pessimistic crowd.
As I pointed out in March, China’s economy did surprisingly well in the first quarter of 2017, and that seems to be the case in the second quarter as well.
In fact, China’s latest monthly data show signs of economic acceleration, especially in consumption.
And it was evident in the first-quarter data that Chinese consumers are becoming an increasingly important driver of economic growth.
When confronted with the numbers, pessimists respond by insisting that China’s recent strong economic performance is only temporary – a product of yet more unsustainable stimulus.
And even if growth does last, they argue, the Chinese authorities will not allow Western businesses – or even Chinese businesses, according to ultra-pessimists – to benefit from it.
But whether or not the pessimists turn out to be right about China, it is odd that business investment remains tepid even during times when the engine of global growth is located elsewhere, such as in the US or Europe (Germany in particular).
During my time as the head of the British government’s Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, I had to develop a better understanding of the pharmaceutical industry, and I learned that there is something to be said for microeconomic forces – and for basic common sense.
Consider the future, which always has been uncertain and always will be.
And yet the biggest economic busts have happened when businesses were not uncertain enough – when they were sure that the future would be rosy.
An overabundance of certainty might explain the 2000-2001 dot-com bubble, and many others.
But if, thanks to the increased availability of so much information (including different viewpoints and opinions), we now know that the future is always uncertain, the behavior of Western businesses (and many in the emerging world) is eminently logical, especially given the current workings of the financial system.
Why would business leaders invest in an uncertain world, rather than paying dividends to demanding (but generally risk-averse) investors, or buying back some of their companies’ own shares (thereby improving the price/earnings ratio and, better yet, increasing their own remuneration)?
At the end of the day, the CEOs and the most aggressive investors are all happy with this approach.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the company’s employees, past and present, who reap no benefits in their paychecks or pensions (which are actually being eroded by the low yields on government bonds across Western countries).
It is past time for our elected governments to change the rules of the game.
For starters, that means updating the tax code to make debt issuance far less attractive, especially when the proceeds are being used to buy back shares.
At a minimum, it should be harder to buy back shares than to issue true dividend payments.
That way, at least all shareholders, not just senior-executive insiders, will benefit.
Furthermore, those same executives should not be remunerated on the basis of short-term price-to-equity targets.
More investors should be demanding that the incentives change to reflect true measures of long-term performance.
To its credit, the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund recently spoke out in favor of such changes.
Other large institutional investors and policymakers should follow suit, to give the corporate world a nudge.
If we change the incentives, we just might finally see business investment make a comeback.
Returning to Investment
GENEVA – At the G20 summit last month in Hangzhou, China, world leaders outlined an ambitious plan for a “new era of global growth.” But they left out a key ingredient: fixing the investment climate.
Conventional wisdom holds that, through efficient financial markets, household savings will flow to companies that can best put the money to productive use.
But in many developing countries, easier access to finance – owing to unrestricted cross-border capital flows and financial-market deregulation – still has not led to more financing for long-term investments, particularly in manufacturing.
Investment decisions depend on a variety of complex factors and contingencies, and a mix of public and private finance is crucial for bringing new projects to fruition.
In East Asia, which has experienced rapid growth and development in recent years, policymakers have not only allowed, but encouraged, higher corporate profits, so long as they are channeled into productive investments.
As a result, as much as four-fifths of large East Asian companies’ investment spending is funded from retained earnings, while publicly owned financial institutions have helped maintain the pace of investment-led growth.
An imbalance between profits and investment is a major reason for today’s tepid growth in developed and developing countries alike; unless it is addressed, the result could be a wider crisis of legitimacy for corporate governance and economic management.
In developed economies, corporate profitability has been steadily rising, partly owing to “shareholder-primacy” strategies that focus on short-term decision-making, cost-cutting measures, and other forms of financial engineering encouraged by institutional investors.
To varying degrees, conventional “retain-and-invest” strategies are being replaced by “downsize-and-distribute” strategies, whereby profits are spent on increased dividends, stock buybacks, and mergers and acquisitions.
In developing economies, global financial flows have most visibly contributed to macroeconomic shocks that fuel economic uncertainty, which shortens corporations’ investment-planning horizon.
More recently, one can also see developing-economy companies pursuing the same corporate-governance strategies as firms in developed countries.
Judging by non-financial firms’ balance sheets, investment-to-profit ratios decreased from 1995 to 2014, with especially steep declines in Brazil, Malaysia, South Korea, and Turkey.
Large public corporations are less common in most developing economies than they are in developed economies; but for those firms that do regularly distribute dividends in developing economies, payouts to shareholders have been increasing, even when profitability has remained roughly the same.
Such firms are also accumulating financial assets – sometimes faster than they are accumulating corporate debt – which suggests that they lack profitable long-term investment opportunities and portfolio-investment options in liberalized financial markets.
It would be premature to suggest that the relationship between profits and investments has broken down in the developing world.
But, as corporate profitability has risen across the board, investment trends everywhere (with the exception of China and India) have been weak, which was true even before the 2008 global financial crisis.
Meanwhile, financialization continues to disrupt macroeconomic stability worldwide.
For example, developed economies’ quantitative easing programs have contributed to excess liquidity – and thus to the recent corporate-debt explosion in emerging economies.
Across a sample of these economies, non-financial corporations’ dollar-denominated debt rose by 40%, on average, from 2010 to 2014; from 2007 to 2015, their debt-service ratios also soared by 40%.
These numbers suggest a systemic banking crisis in the making.
Moreover, debt-fueled investment has been concentrated in highly cyclical natural-resources-based sectors that do not contribute to inclusive and sustainable growth.
In fact, just seven sectors – oil and gas, electricity, construction, industrial commodities, real estate, telecommunications, and mining – account for more than two-thirds of the total increase in both debt and investment.
This suggests that easy access to cheap money and debt financing have not favored the high-tech sectors that contribute the most to productivity growth.
To reverse these trends, we must first reverse the trend in emerging economies toward highly financialized corporate strategies.
This will require changes in corporate governance generally, and in non-financial corporations’ incentive structures, including preferential tax treatment for retained profits and equity finance, and special depreciation allowances for reinvested profits.
Beyond corporate governance, we must restore balance to the profit-investment relationship through institutional as well as public-policy initiatives, and with proactive industrial policies.
This will require reforming and deepening the banking system to ensure enough lending capacity for long-term investments, including for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
As for the macroeconomic environment, governments can improve conditions through public investment, particularly in infrastructure, which will augment productivity and add to private-sector profitability.
Lastly, the international community should vigorously pursue efforts to police tax avoidance and capital flight, both of which erode states’ revenue base.
Long-term investment in productive assets is essential to ensuring the sustained growth that developing economies need.
But they won’t achieve it by maintaining an environment that encourages short-term strategies.
Fixing the Food Chain
COPENHAGEN – The global food system is in disarray.
Four years ago, a 30-year trend of decreasing food prices rapidly reversed course.
Grain prices have more than doubled since 2004, and prices for most other foods have increased significantly.
Add unsustainable management of natural resources, emerging negative effects of climate change, and sharply rising prices for fertilizers and energy, and we are faced with the most severe global food crisis since the early 1970’s.
Dramatic price hikes reflect several factors: adverse weather in key food production areas, rapid increase in demand for meats and dairy products, higher oil prices, draw-downs of food stocks, greater use of food commodities for bio-fuel, and failure to invest in rural infrastructure, research and technology, and other public goods needed to facilitate agricultural growth in developing countries.
The skyrocketing cost of food has resulted in more starvation among the poor, reduced purchasing power among the non-poor, and food riots in more than 30 countries.
The key lesson to learn is that insufficient investment in science and inappropriate government policies lead to food crises.
To avoid these shortcomings in the future, the world’s farmers and food processors must be helped to produce more food to meet increasing demand fueled by growth in world population and incomes.
Moreover, they must produce more with less land and water, at reasonable prices, and without damaging natural resources or worsening climate change.
But are governments getting the message?
I believe so.
Hunger is not a new phenomenon, but as long as the rural poor endure it in silence, as they have for a long time, governments can comfortably ignore it.
Food riots by urban populations, on the other hand, threaten what governments care about the most: their legitimacy.
Developing countries invest only slightly more that 0.5% of the value of their agricultural production in agricultural research.
That is grossly inadequate.
An increase to 2% is warranted.
This would still be less than what high-income countries invest in agricultural research.
Modern science should focus on sustainable increases in land and water productivity, management of production risks caused by droughts, floods, pests, and on mitigation and adaption to climate change.
Drought-tolerant and pest-resistant crop varieties, disease-resistant livestock, and high-yield agricultural production systems that use less water and capture nitrogen from the air are but a few examples of the kind of technologies needed.
More research is also needed to improve the nutritional quality of staple foods by fortifying them with iron, vitamin A, and zinc to help solve widespread micronutrient deficiencies.
We must also strengthen food safety from production to consumption, including improvements in our understanding of the interaction between the food system and human health, particularly zoonotic diseases and the effects of pesticides.
Research to identify alternative energy sources to stop the conversion of maize, soybeans, oil palm, and other foods to bio-fuel should become another high priority.
Most of the people at risk of hunger and malnutrition live in rural areas.
They need access to roads, markets, appropriate institutions and technology, primary health care, and education if they are to escape poverty and hunger and produce more food for an increasing world population.
Both public and private investments are needed to provide such access.
Government action is needed to make markets work in developing countries and to give farmers and market agents access to appropriate technology and knowledge. Unfortunately, rapidly falling food prices during the 30-year period since the food crisis of the early 1970’s gave governments a convenient excuse for doing little or nothing.
Public policy is needed in many other areas, including legislation to incorporate environmental costs into food prices, thereby encouraging sustainable production, as well as incentives and regulations to promote more efficient water use.
National and international bio-safety regimes should be implemented to guide the development, application, and trade of modern technology and genetically modified food.
Government subsidies that increase the use of food commodities such as maize, soybeans, and palm oil for bio-fuel should be discontinued.
International institutions are needed to regulate globalization and ensure trade competition.
Trade-distorting agricultural policies, including those in the United States, the European Union, and Japan, should be eliminated.
While poverty reduction is the best way to reduce fertility rates, access to reproductive health care is critically important for helping families limit the number of children they have to the number they desire.
The world’s natural resources are sufficient to produce the food needed in the foreseeable future without damaging the environment, but only if governments follow enlightened policies and science is put to work for the food system.
Fixing the Innovation Supply Chain
CAMBRIDGE – As a graduate student at MIT, I had the opportunity to work with Professors Robert Langer and Ram Sasisekharan in an environment rife with innovative thinking.
We asked what could be possible, and were driven to pursue revolutionary technologies that were widely considered impossible.
This experience instilled in me a simple but powerful credo: think big.
Innovation is difficult.
If one is willing to traverse the boundary of the unknown, one should pursue the course that promises the greatest potential impact.
In exploring a wide range of subjects – energy, agriculture, medicine, and more – one approach has, in my experience, emerged as the most effective: begin with the end in mind.
By identifying the problems and envisioning the preferred solution, one can define the set of constraints into which technological innovation fits, and establish a clear, albeit often difficult, path to its realization.
A fundamental requirement of this approach is an open mind, unconstrained by the subject’s idiosyncratic dogma.
Those who are immersed in a field have an established view of what is possible, based on some combination of previous successes, citation bias, current limits of knowledge, and truth – and it is often difficult to distinguish these sources.
But the newcomer asking the most basic questions begins to notice logical inconsistencies, from which the real constraints on solutions and technological limits arise.
Breakthroughs lie at the intersection of technological possibility and market pull.
An understanding of these forces enables innovators to optimize the direction of invention.
With well-defined constraints, a clear path for developing innovative technologies – one that accounts for both the known and the unknown – can be planned.
This unconventional approach has consistently produced groundbreaking technologies that, if successfully implemented, revolutionize a field.
What might be more interesting, however, is the response that such progress often elicits: “This seems so obvious.
Why hasn’t someone done it before?” Early in my career, this reaction troubled me; it made me wonder whether I had, in fact, overlooked something obvious.
But, as my experience with entrepreneurial innovation has grown, I have realized that the response is rooted in the fact that most people are trapped in a specific doctrine, which obscures the innovative solutions that lie beyond its borders.
Companies exhibit similar behavior when it comes to acquiring innovative technologies, adhering to ineffective, restrictive processes, despite an ostensibly obvious alternative: the efficient systems that manufacturers use to secure inputs for production.
In order to establish a clear, low-risk path to producing their goods at a predictable (and profitable) cost, companies employ teams dedicated to securing the relevant supply chains, controlling inventory, managing the production process, and so on – from the point of origin to the point of consumption.
In many cases, this involves maintaining relationships with a dedicated network of suppliers, with which producers share detailed product specifications.
Doing so ensures that producers get exactly what they need, and that suppliers are able to deliver the correct inputs. The result is a well-defined, highly productive, and mutually beneficial working relationship.
By contrast, the innovation supply chain (the process by which companies obtain and/or develop future products and improve on their current products) tends to be characterized by inefficiency, ambiguity, and competition.
And, in many cases, no supply chain is in place.
Most pharmaceutical companies, for example, lack effective innovation supply chains.
But only about 15% of the drugs that the US Food and Drug Administration has approved recently were developed by the same company that markets and sells them, meaning that many major pharmaceutical companies depend on the innovation ecosystem to advance their products.
Drug companies often lament that the firms from which they are sourcing innovations do not perform clinical trials to their specifications, forcing them to repeat the work.
Nevertheless, they are reticent about providing such specifications in advance – even when innovators request them – perhaps to protect their market position or internal efforts.
Moreover, the same companies compete directly in the supply of innovative technologies.
The result is a broken supply chain.
Just as individual innovators must challenge conventional wisdom, companies must replace the established approach to the innovation supply chain with one that more closely resembles how they create and maintain a manufacturing supply chain.
If market incumbents are willing to share “innovation specifications” (which should not be confused with innovation methods), they can develop an effective network of innovation suppliers, thereby increasing the reliability of the product-development engine.
And, as with effective manufacturing supply chains, the supplier and the purchaser must build a reciprocal relationship, in which they do not compete with each other, practically or economically, in the specific activities that they are performing.
An efficient supply chain can transform innovation on both the individual and industry levels.
Indeed, a common approach – defining key market needs, coupling them with solution constraints, and pushing the boundaries of current thinking – applies to all kinds of innovation.
With an innovation ecosystem organized along these lines, “obvious” advances could occur significantly faster.
How obvious is that?
Helping Refugees Together
LONDON – This year is likely to be the most momentous for refugee protection and migration since the signing of the Geneva Convention in 1951.
Depending on the choices we make, we will either help create more open societies, based on greater international cooperation, or we will abet authoritarian governments and their nationalist agendas.
So we must treat this issue with exceptional urgency and seriousness of purpose.
The refugee and migration crises in the Mediterranean, Asia, Africa, and Central America have led to widespread and appalling human suffering.
The significance of this can hardly be overstated, for the world’s failure to help its most vulnerable people reflects an extraordinary breakdown of morality in the international community.
We are at risk of losing our collective understanding of why the multilateral system and international cooperation matter.
When we refuse to protect those facing persecution, we not only endanger them; we subvert our principles of civil liberty and put our own freedom at risk.
Last year, we were offered literally a million reminders that the system of refugee protection was failing.
Each asylum-seeker bravely crossing the Mediterranean was telling us that something was wrong in countries of first asylum.
How could we have allowed Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey to bear the burden of hosting almost five million refugees with negligible backing from the rest of the world?
It costs at least $3,000 a year to provide a refugee with a decent level of support; the international community provided just a small fraction of this.
When the cracks in the protection system became gaping holes, refugees voted with their feet.
Then, in a panicked effort to deter arrivals, the European Union – the birthplace of the international protection system – jeopardized its tradition of human rights and the basic standards of asylum law.
The signal this sends to frontline countries – that they need not fully respect the rules of protection – could be devastating.
In the misguided belief that safeguarding sovereignty means acting unilaterally, governments have resisted an international approach to migration.
But as events in the Mediterranean have starkly demonstrated, this approach is self-defeating.
It leads to paper-tiger sovereignty, undermines the credibility of democratic governments and the multilateral system, and empowers smugglers and authoritarian populists.
We must bring this downward spiral to a halt.
A systemic global crisis demands a systemic global response.
By the time world leaders meet in September at the United Nations Summit on Addressing Large Movements of Refugees and Migrants, the global community must acknowledge what went wrong – and agree on how to fix it.
Rather than shifting the burden, we need to start sharing responsibility.
The smartest way to safeguard national sovereignty is to minimize the risks migrants face when trying to reach safety, and to maximize the means at their disposal to build productive lives.
Accomplishing this require three things.
First, we must use the political momentum around the refugee issue to generate commitments to specific improvements in the international protection system and to reduce the vulnerability of all migrants.
It is simply unacceptable that just ten countries are forced to bear the lion’s share of the burden, that 86% of refugees reside in the developing world, and that fewer than 100,000 per year are resettled.
Supporting refugees is not optional, and we cannot allow responsibility to be defined merely by proximity to a crisis.
We must no longer go from year to year, crisis to crisis, begging for pledges (which all too often go unfulfilled).
We should calculate what it costs to support forced migrants and the countries that host them – as if we were preparing a family budget – and then collectively contribute the necessary funding within the context of a long-term plan.
We also must expand our capacity to host refugees through resettlement and other legal pathways – such as student, work, and family reunification visas.
Second, strengthening the international protection system requires us to rethink the very idea of our responsibility toward refugees.
We can no longer afford to treat them as deadweight in permanent camps.
Instead, we must help them become active, contributing members of our communities.
Our model must be based on refugees’ full inclusion, as soon as possible, in labor markets and schools.
And we must vow never to hold children in detention.
Finally, the UN system must develop greater capacity to address migration and provide migrants with a stronger voice at the global level.
Only then will we be able to agree on a set of commitments to reduce the risks that all migrants face, ensuring rescue at sea, offering safe pathways to relocation, and providing legal identities.
The degree of public and political attention that refugees and migration are receiving this year is not likely to be repeated in my lifetime or in that of the next generation.
The condition of many humans – not to mention the human condition itself – will improve or worsen depending on how we use this opportunity.
A Better EU Budget
BRUSSELS – Stopping Europe’s economic decline and overcoming its competitiveness crisis will require radical solutions.
But European Union leaders remain fixated on old priorities – a lack of vision evident in negotiations over the EU’s 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).
Once again, short-term national interests are taking precedence over the need for a forward-looking, flexible, and efficient EU budget.
The European Parliament, which for the first time must approve the MFF, should use its new-found influence to uphold the EU-wide public interest and offset the blinkered, vested interests of individual member states.
In a climate of budgetary restraint, it is unsurprising that the European Council agreed earlier this year to reduce the EU budget by 3.4% relative to the 2007-2013 MFF.
But, with austerity under fire and EU countries looking to encourage spending, the Council should also consider the budget’s shape, ensuring that the MFF does not impede future growth and investment.
For example, the proposed budget slashes funding for cross-border infrastructure projects, including the expansion of high-speed broadband networks into rural areas and the development of transport and energy infrastructure.
But the EU can add considerable value by coordinating transnational infrastructure projects, thereby achieving economies of scale and avoiding a duplication of national spending.
Europeans would benefit directly through improved Internet access, lower energy costs, and more efficient transport links.
Likewise, in order to lay the foundations for future economic growth, the EU should nurture new, sustainable industries and innovative small and medium-size enterprises – not cut funding for important research programs like Horizon 2020.
Innovations in renewable energy, for example, are essential to improving energy security and preserving Europe’s standing as a global leader in combating climate change.
Given that renewable energy is one of the world’s fastest-growing sectors, such investment could have a significant impact on future GDP growth and job creation.
Meanwhile, agricultural subsidies and cohesion funds, which were cut by 11% and 8%, respectively, relative to the previous MFF, still account for almost two-thirds of total spending.
While these areas are important, their allocations should be reduced further to create space for growth-enhancing investments.
Another major problem is the MFF’s lack of flexibility.
A priority review during the budgetary term would enable the EU to adapt its annual budgets to changing circumstances and reallocate unspent money where it is needed most.
Moreover, the current structure of the EU’s annual budget carries financial risks.
For example, many projects are completed toward the end of the budgetary cycle, generating a backlog of unpaid bills in the MFF’s later years.
If they are not addressed through an MFF-amending budget, they risk fueling a run-up in debt.
While the Council eventually agreed to cover the difference in the 2012 budget, an even greater shortfall is forecast for this year – and many member states are unable to oblige the Commission’s request for an additional €11.2 billion to cover these outstanding liabilities.
Now, the European Parliament is insisting that all unpaid bills should be settled before the next budgetary cycle begins.
To be sure, the EU budget contains flexible instruments, such as the EU Solidarity Fund, which provides emergency assistance after natural disasters.
But these tools have not always been used as effectively as possible.
Disbursal of relief funds to help Italy rebuild after severe floods in 2011 took almost a year, owing to politicization in the Council.
Even without the delays caused by political interference, such instruments are inadequate.
Scope to adapt the MFF as a whole is needed, not least to ensure its legitimacy.
It should include a comprehensive and binding revision clause ensuring that the state of public finances and collective investment needs are reassessed at the halfway point.
This would give the next European Parliament – and the voters who elect its members – the influence over the EU’s long-term budget that a democratic system requires.
Agreement on budgetary priorities should be achieved in the Council through qualified majority voting, so that a single country cannot hijack the process.
A “sunset clause” would prevent the Council from blocking subsequent revisions by, say, stipulating that the budget would revert to 2013 levels if no review were conducted by the specified date.
In the long term, the MFF’s timing should be adjusted to coincide with the European Parliament’s mandate, and the EU’s excessive reliance on national contributions should be reduced.
As trade liberalization has diminished the EU’s income, mainly derived from customs duties, individual countries have increasingly sought to minimize their net contributions.
Bargaining between member states leads to lowest-common-denominator budgets that appease vested interests but fail to support EU member states’ shared ambitions.
Europe thus ends up losing, and the true benefits of EU membership are not fully realized.
Add to that the way deals are reached – behind closed doors and without adequate democratic oversight – and it is not surprising that Europeans’ views of the EU are becoming increasingly negative.
A system based on the EU’s own resources would reduce tension between contributors and beneficiaries and ease pressure on member states’ budgets.
Existing proposals include a “Robin Hood” tax on financial transactions, a share of the profits from the EU’s carbon emissions-trading scheme, or a larger take from value-added tax receipts.
But the Council has left this potentially contentious subject out of recent discussions.
That is precisely the problem.
Political leadership calls for vision and courage.
Postponing important decisions leads to an inefficient budget shaped by competing national interests.
Without a responsive budgetary policy that focuses on the EU as a whole, the MFF negotiations will provide plenty of high drama and fine rhetoric, but few real benefits that might boost Europe’s recovery.
Missing Growth Multipliers
PRINCETON – In April 2010, when the global economy was beginning to recover from the shock of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook predicted that global GDP growth would exceed 4% in 2010, with a steady annual growth rate of 4.5% maintained through 2015.
But the forecast proved to be far too optimistic.
In fact, global growth has decelerated.
In its most recent WEO, the IMF forecasts global GDP to grow by only 3.3% in 2012, and by 3.6% in 2013.
Moreover, the downgrading of growth prospects is remarkably widespread.
The forecast errors have three potential sources: failure to recognize the time needed for economic recovery after a financial crisis; underestimation of the “fiscal multipliers” (the size of output loss owing to fiscal austerity); and neglect of the “world-trade multiplier” (the tendency for countries to drag each other down as their economies contract).
For the most part, the severity and implications of the financial crisis were judged well.
Lessons from the October 2008 WEO, which analyzed recoveries after systemic financial stress, were incorporated into subsequent forecasts.
As a result, predictions for the United States – where household deleveraging continues to constrain economic growth – have fallen short only modestly.
The April 2010 report forecast a US growth rate of roughly 2.5% annually in 2012-2013; current projections put the rate a little higher than 2%.
By contrast, the fiscal multiplier was seriously underestimated – as the WEO has now recognized.
Consequently, forecasts for the United Kingdom – where financial-sector stresses largely resembled those in the US – have been significantly less accurate.
The April 2010 WEO forecast a UK annual growth rate of nearly 3% in 2012-2013; instead, GDP is likely to contract this year and increase by roughly 1% next year.
Much of this costly divergence from the earlier projections can be attributed to the benign view of fiscal consolidation that UK authorities and the IMF shared.
Likewise, the eurozone’s heavily indebted economies (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) have performed considerably worse than projected, owing to significant spending cuts and tax hikes.
For example, Portugal’s GDP was expected to grow by 1% this year; in fact, it will contract by a stunning 3%.
The European Commission’s claim that this slowdown reflects high sovereign-default risk, rather than fiscal consolidation, is belied by the UK, where the sovereign risk is deemed by markets to be virtually nonexistent.
The world-trade multiplier, though less widely recognized, helps to explain why the growth deceleration has been so widespread and persistent.
When a country’s economic growth slows, it imports less from other countries, thereby reducing those countries’ growth rates, and causing them, too, to reduce imports.
The eurozone has been at the epicenter of this contractionary force on global growth.
Since eurozone countries trade extensively with each other and the rest of the world, their slowdowns have contributed significantly to a decrease in global trade, in turn undermining global growth.
In particular, as European imports from East Asia have fallen, East Asian economies’ growth is down sharply from last year and the 2010 forecast – and, predictably, growth in their imports from the rest of the world has lost momentum.
Global trade has steadily weakened, with almost no increase in the last six months.
The once-popular notion, built into growth forecasts, that exports would provide an escape route from the crisis was never credible.
That notion has now been turned on its head: as economic growth has stalled, falling import demand from trade partners has caused economic woes to spread and deepen.
The impact of slowing global trade is most apparent for Germany, which was not burdened with excessive household or corporate debt, and enjoyed a favorable fiscal position.
To escape the crisis, Germany used rapid export growth – especially to meet voracious Chinese demand. Although growth was expected to slow subsequently, it was forecast at roughly 2% in 2012-2013.
But, as Chinese growth has decelerated – owing partly to decreased exports to Europe – the German GDP forecast has been halved.
And, given that this year’s growth has largely already occurred, Germany’s economy has now plateaued – and could even be contracting.
In good times, the trade generated by a country’s growth bolsters global growth.
But, in times of crisis, the trade spillovers have the opposite effect.
As the global economy has become increasingly interconnected, these trade multipliers have increased.
Indeed, while less ominous and dramatic than financial contagion, trade spillovers profoundly influence global growth prospects.
Failure to recognize their impact implies that export – and, in turn, growth – projections will continue to miss the mark.
The projected increase in global growth next year will likely not happen.
On the contrary, policy errors and delays in individual countries will seriously damage economies worldwide.
The Elusive Benefits of Flexible Exchange Rates
CAMBRIDGE – In 1953, Milton Friedman published an essay called “The Case for Flexible Exchange Rates,” arguing that they cushion an economy from internal and external shocks by bringing about just the right price changes required to keep the economy at full employment.
But after almost half-a-century of floating exchange rates, the reality is more complicated than that.
To understand Friedman’s logic, consider a scenario in which productivity in the United States rises.
In an efficient system, this should reduce the price of US goods relative to those of the rest of the world, with US exports becoming cheaper than imports.
As America’s terms of trade (the ratio of export prices to import prices) deteriorate, demand is shifted toward US goods, keeping the economy at full employment.
If prices are “sticky” (in the producer’s currency), however, a potential hitch emerges.
Say the prices of US imports from Japan are sticky in Japanese yen and the prices of US exports to Japan are sticky in dollars.
The terms of trade will thus remain unchanged, as long as the exchange rate does as well.
Here is where a floating exchange rate comes in.
By enabling monetary expansion, and thus causing the US dollar to depreciate, the logic goes, a floating exchange rate allows the prices of US exports to decline relative to its imports.
The result is the desired deterioration of the producer’s terms of trade and the maintenance of full employment.
But this line of reasoning assumes that a country’s terms of trade move in lockstep with its exchange rate.
And that, as history over a quarter-century has shown, does not seem to be the case.
In a recent paper, the International Monetary Fund’s Emine Boz, Princeton’s Mikkel Plagborg-Møller, and I construct bilateral export- and import-price indices for 2,500 country pairs, covering 91% of world trade for the period 1989-2015.
We exclude the prices of commodities (oil, copper, and other such goods that are traded on an exchange), as these prices are not sticky.
As it turns out, there is no evidence that the terms of trade and the exchange rate move in tandem.
On the contrary, a 1% depreciation in the bilateral exchange rate is associated with only a 0.1% depreciation in the bilateral terms of trade in the year of the depreciation.
The origin of this disconnect – which Camila Casas, Federico Diez, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, and I describe in a 2016 paper – seems to be that, for the vast majority of internationally traded goods, prices are sticky in dollars, not in the producer’s currency, as Friedman’s reasoning required.
Consider the case of the US and Japan.
Almost 100% of US exports to Japan are priced in dollars, meaning that they, as in Friedman’s version, are sticky in dollars.
But 80% of US imports from Japan are invoiced in dollars, meaning that those prices, too, are sticky in dollars, rather than in Japanese yen.
As a result, the terms of trade change very little, even if the exchange rate fluctuates.
This means that, even if the US dollar depreciates, it does not become more expensive for US importers to buy Japanese goods, so there is limited incentive to switch from Japanese to US goods. A weaker dollar thus has limited impact on US imports.
Likewise, a weaker yen does little to spur Japanese exports to the US, because the dollar price of those exports remains roughly constant.
This phenomenon applies even to trade transactions that do not include the US.
As I documented in a 2015 paper, the share of world imports invoiced in US dollars is 4.7 times larger than the share of world imports involving the US. For world exports, that figure is 3.1.
This “dominant currency paradigm” lies at the root of the terms-of-trade disconnect.
In fact, we document that global trade prices and volumes are driven by the dollar exchange rate, rather than the exchange rate between the two trading partners’ currencies.
So fluctuations in the price and quantity of India’s imports from China, for example, depend on the rupee-dollar exchange rate, rather than the rupee-renminbi exchange rate.
The strength of the US dollar is thus a key predictor of aggregate trade volume and consumer/producer price inflation worldwide.
Friedman was right about one thing: flexible exchange rates do provide valuable monetary-policy independence.
But, in a dollar-dominated trade environment, their ability to support full employment is severely limited.
From Economic Analysis to Inclusive Growth
WASHINGTON, DC – Most economies are seeking a recipe for inclusive economic growth, whereby high rates of investment, rapid innovation, and strong GDP gains are pursued alongside measures to reduce income inequality.
Conservatives insist that growth requires low taxes and incentives such as flexible labor markets to encourage entrepreneurship.
But reducing inequality requires higher levels of government spending and taxation (except when government is pursuing deficit spending to stimulate a depressed economy).
The Scandinavian economic model is often invoked to bridge this gap.
The Danish “flexicurity” system, in particular, has historically delivered solid economic performance alongside low inequality.
Leading economists such as Philippe Aghion have published excellent analyses of how this model could balance growth, equality, and overall satisfaction of citizens elsewhere in the world.
These economists argue that labor markets with few restrictions on hiring and firing, low taxes on entrepreneurship, and generous incentives for innovation are compatible with a relatively equal income distribution, high social spending by government, and equalizing social policies such as universal free education.
This model has sustained an ongoing debate in Europe, one that is now relevant in the United States, because Donald Trump’s new administration has promised to help globalization’s “losers” while improving innovation and growth.
But in the US, it is far more difficult, politically, to argue for generous public spending on education, health care, and financial security for retirees, because doing so always raises the specter of high taxes.
An inclusive growth model would seem to have to square the policy circle.
It would have to increase substantially public spending, particularly on education, unemployment benefits and training, and health.
It is useful to look at the numbers from the oft-cited Danish and Swedish examples.
Generally speaking, these countries have excellent economic indicators.
Although GDP growth is not higher than in the US, most people share a high standard of living, and surveys show that Scandinavians (particularly Danes) are some of the happiest people in the world.
But, as the following chart shows, these countries also have some of the highest government spending- and taxation-to-GDP ratios in the OECD.
Hypothetically, if the US adopted Denmark’s universal free education policy, but kept its tax-to-GDP ratio unchanged, its fiscal deficit would exceed 6% of GDP.
The US has run deficits that high only during World War II and the Great Recession of 2008-2009, when a huge stimulus package was implemented to spur recovery.
So, just providing universal free education in the US would run the country’s deficit up to the highest level ever recorded in normal times.
In the context of this comparison, it would seem that the circle cannot be squared without a major macroeconomic shift.
Scandinavian countries are smaller and can more efficiently collect revenues and administer public services.
But even if the US approached this efficiency – a difficult feat in such a large and diverse country – social solidarity still would demand high effective taxes, as it does in Denmark and Sweden.
Another crucial component of the Scandinavian model is labor-market flexibility.
On the OECD “Employment Protection Legislation” index, the US scores a 1.2 on a 0-5 scale, where zero indicates full flexibility.
Meanwhile, France and Germany come in at 2.8, Italy at 2.9, and Denmark and Sweden at 2.3 and 2.5, respectively.
This shows that, though Scandinavian labor markets are more flexible than elsewhere in continental Europe, the US labor market is far more flexible – and provides less security – than any of them.
Such broad static accounting suggests that we should proceed cautiously in applying lessons from the Scandinavian model to large countries like the US.
Then again, to assess a model’s long-term impact on citizens’ welfare, we would need a more dynamic analysis over the course of at least a decade.
Only then could we gauge how strongly investment and innovation would respond to incentives, how much free universal education would cost in the medium term, or how demographic structures would affect different social policies.
Economic analysis alone cannot settle the political debate between right and left.
What it can do is help to narrow and focus that debate.
The key is for participants on both sides to be more explicit about the values and objectives they believe that society should pursue, and to quantify their assumptions about how dynamic performance will respond to particular incentives.
Only then can a democracy choose effectively between potential paths.
Good economic analysis can enable “constructive populists” to debate the “post-fact, fanciful populists” who seem to be on the rise, with a realistic alternative discourse – one that is transparent and based on credible expectations of economic policies and outcomes.
In other words, economic analysis can facilitate good choices; it cannot make them.
When Democracy Fails the People
NEW YORK – Nobel laureate Amartya Sen famously suggested that famines do not occur in democracies, because accountable governments will do everything they can to avoid mass starvation.
The same reasoning should apply to clean drinking water; like food, it is a resource that is indispensable for our survival and wellbeing.
And yet recent events in the United States offer depressing insights about the limits of Sen’s dictum, and about how democracies can fail the people they are ostensibly supposed to serve.
In 2014, the municipal government of Flint, Michigan, stopped purchasing water from Detroit and began sourcing it from a nearby river.
The decision was motivated by cost concerns.
Worries about the quality of the water were disregarded.
The river water, it turned out, corroded the city’s aging pipes; by the time it left the taps, it could contain high levels of toxic lead.
And yet nobody seemed to care.
The city and state governments looked the other way, even after companies and hospitals declared the water unfit for use and switched to other sources.
Flint’s residents complained of the water’s color and taste.
But no matter how loud they raised their voices – either alone or collectively – they were disparaged as ignorant or dismissed as serial complainers.
Even after doctors presented evidence that lead levels in the blood of the city’s children had doubled in the space of a year, the objections of the people of Flint fell on deaf ears.
The US may be one of the world’s most successful democracies, with regular elections and a representative government that is supposed to be – in Abraham Lincoln’s famous phrase – “of the people, by the people, for the people.”
And yet not one level of government took the necessary measures to ensure that the residents of Flint had access to safe drinking water.
And Flint is not a solitary case; it is emblematic of a global problem.
Millions of people worldwide lack access to clean drinking water.
All too often, the world’s poor are forced to drink contaminated water, drill holes in pipelines, or buy bottled water that is far more expensive than what flows from the taps of their richer neighbors.
And the issue is only growing in importance as competition for drinking water heats up.
When a government proves unresponsive or incompetent, a common prescription is to limit its influence, so that the power of the market can be unleashed.
But when it comes to essential resources – such as water – this approach becomes morally repugnant.
Allocating clean water, for example, to those able to pay the most for it results in situations where industrial applications win out over individual needs, leaving many with none.
The real problem is not water scarcity; it is that existing supplies are unequally distributed and thus unaffordable to the poor.
This might be tolerable when it comes to ordinary goods – not everyone can have a yacht; but when it comes to an essential resource, we must ensure access on an equitable basis.
That means we have to find a better way to govern resources like water.
For a message to be effective, it must reach and influence those in control – whether they are elected officials, regulators, or private actors.
Elections provide people with the opportunity to vote, but that is not the same thing as giving them a voice, much less ensuring that raised voices are listened to.
Flint is not only a wake-up call for democracy in the US; it is a stark lesson in the need for better governance worldwide.
When cost-cutting efforts produce drinking water that fails to meet basic health standards, “government for the people” has been seriously eroded.
As the late Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom demonstrated, ordinary people are capable of sharing resources and avoiding the “tragedy of the commons.”
And yet the imperative for action lies with those in control of essential resources, not with those in need of them.
If the problem of equitable access is to be solved, authorities must fulfill their responsibility to the governed, which means listening, learning, and ultimately leading the effort to address it.
Rediscovering Fiscal Policy at the G7
ALGIERS – As G7 leaders convene in Ise-Shima, Japan, the global economy’s fragility is a top concern.
But instead of focusing on currency wars, the leaders of the major developed economies should be discussing fiscal policy, which under current conditions would be a more powerful tool than monetary policy for boosting economic activity.
After all, today, unlike in normal times, the effects of fiscal policy would not be limited by too-high interest rates, inadequate private demand, strict capacity constraints, or excessive inflation.
Economists dismiss fiscal policy largely because it is “politically constrained.”
But that is not a good reason to give up on it.
On the contrary, if the political process is producing problematic fiscal policies, as it is today, that is all the more reason for economists to voice their concerns.
The heyday of activist fiscal policy was a half-century ago.
Most advanced countries pursued a countercyclical approach, reining in spending or raising taxes during periods of economic expansion and enacting stimulus policies during recessions.
The saying “we are all Keynesians now,” attributed to Milton Friedman in 1965 and Richard Nixon in 1971, captured the economic zeitgeist.
But, after 2000, some began to pursue pro-cyclical budgetary policies.
When the economy was booming, they implemented fiscal stimulus, thereby reinforcing the upswing.
When the economy experienced a downturn, they pursued fiscal austerity, exacerbating the recession.
Among those who acted pro-cyclically were some US politicians.
At the beginning of this century, President George W. Bush threw away the large fiscal surpluses that he had inherited from Bill Clinton, enacting large tax cuts and rapid spending increases even from 2003 to 2007, as the economy neared its peak.
He was aided and abetted by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who bizarrely considered the surpluses a threat.
It was during this period that Vice President Dick Cheney reportedly declared that former President Ronald Reagan had proved that “deficits don’t matter.”
Saddled with debt, US leaders felt less able to enact badly needed fiscal stimulus when the Great Recession hit in 2007.
Democrats understood that it was necessary, but Republicans decided, at precisely the wrong time, that deficits were bad, after all.
In January 2009, when the economy was tanking, the Republicans voted against President Barack Obama’s fiscal stimulus plan.
Fortunately, the policy was enacted nonetheless, making a major contribution to reversing the free-fall.
But once the Republicans took over the House of Representatives in 2010, they were able to block Obama’s further attempts to stimulate the still-weak economy.
Then there is the poster child for the post-millennial turn to pro-cyclical fiscal policy: Greece.
Like Bush, the country ran excessive budget deficits while the economy was expanding, from 2003 to 2008.
Then, in 2010, confronting a massive debt crisis, Greece acquiesced to its European creditors and adopted strict austerity, which exacerbated economic contraction.
As a result, far from restoring a sustainable debt burden as intended, the policy caused the debt-to-GDP ratio to rise rapidly.
European countries in general base their budget plans on unnecessarily biased official forecasts, which can push them toward pro-cyclical policy.
Before 2008, all eurozone members, not only Greece, “unexpectedly” exceeded the 3%-of-GDP ceiling for budget deficits at times.
And, after 2008, the pattern of pro-cyclical fiscal contraction, leading to falling income and rising debt-to-GDP ratios, played out not just in Greece, but in Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain as well.
Austerity’s leading champion is, no surprise, Germany.
The Germans had reluctantly agreed, at the April 2009 G20 summit in London, that the US, China, and other major countries would expand demand to help pull the world out of recession.
But when the Greek crisis erupted at the end of that year, the Germans reverted to their deeply held beliefs in fiscal rectitude.
At first, the International Monetary Fund went along with the claim by Greece’s creditors that austerity could work.
But in January 2013, the IMF’s then-chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, published a paper concluding that fiscal multipliers were much higher than the IMF had thought, and thus that the austerity programs in the struggling countries of the eurozone’s periphery might have been excessive.
Today, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde well recognizes that, for Greece to achieve a sustainable debt-to-GDP ratio, it needs more debt relief, not demands for surpluses of 3.5% of GDP.
Japan, host of this week’s G7 meeting, has also made fiscal mistakes.
In April 2014, even with the Bank of Japan having pursued aggressive quantitative easing to kick-start economic growth, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe followed through on a planned consumption-tax hike, from 5% to 8%.
As many had predicted, Japan fell back into recession.
Very soon, Abe must decide whether to raise the consumption tax again, to 10%.
While Japanese officials are not being unreasonable in worrying about the country’s huge national debt, near-zero interest rates show that creditworthiness is not the problem today.
What Japan needs is a stronger economy.
This clearly indicates that Japan should not proceed with another large increase in the consumption tax.
What it could do instead is pursue a pre-set path of small annual increases in the consumption tax over the next 20 years.
To be sure, there are also examples of countries that have used countercyclical fiscal policy to their advantage since 2000.
Some developing countries – including Chile, Botswana, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea – took advantage of the boom years to run budget surpluses, pay down debt, and build up reserves.
As a result, they had enough fiscal space to relax such policies when the 2008-2009 crisis hit.
Unfortunately, some that escaped pro-cyclicality in the last decade have since been backsliding.
Thailand is one example.
Another is Brazil, whose failure to take advantage of the renewed commodity boom of 2010-2011 to eliminate its budget deficit contributed substantially to the mess it is in today.
Politicians virtually everywhere would do well to re-read the fiscal policy chapter in their introductory macroeconomics textbooks.
Fast-Tracking Climate Action
BONN – Last December in Paris, world leaders came together to agree on a set of goals and pathways for decarbonizing the global economy and increasing our capacity to adapt to climate change.
It was a landmark achievement, but it was just the beginning.
Every country – with the support of cities, the private sector, and citizens – must now move swiftly to fulfill its promises and bring climate change under control.
The need for urgent, concerted action cannot be emphasized enough.
Any delay will cause negative consequences to continue to accumulate.
This will not only cause tremendous suffering, especially to the world’s most vulnerable people; it will reverberate for decades to come, making the key goal of keeping the increase in global temperature below 2º Celsius (relative to pre-industrial levels) increasingly costly.
The rapid progress that is needed will require major reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, achieved through increased investment in the development and expansion of cleaner and more efficient energy.
At the same time, efforts to conserve and expand carbon “sinks” – that is, the forests, wetlands, grasslands, mangroves, and sea grasses that absorb much of the CO2 being emitted – are crucial.
But even under the most optimistic scenarios, it will take time to engineer a global shift away from fossil fuels toward renewable energies and to restore the world’s badly depleted ecological infrastructure.
That is why it is important to pursue measures to reduce short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), which also cause climate change.
These include black carbon or soot (the primary component of particulate matter that is also a major and growing health concern); hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), used most commonly in refrigeration; and methane and tropospheric (or ground-level) ozone.
Pound for pound, these “super pollutants” cause much more warming than CO2.
Indeed, the warming impact of soot is about 900 times greater than that of carbon, and the impact of methane is about 28 times greater; many of the HFCs have a warming impact that is about 2,000 times more powerful than that of CO2.
The problems caused by SLCPs extend beyond climate change.
Black carbon and tropospheric ozone pollution are traditional air pollutants, which together kill nearly seven million people a year and destroy hundreds of millions of tons of food crops.
The United Nations Environment Programme’s Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants estimates that fast action to reduce SLCPs, especially methane and black carbon, has the potential to slow down the warming expected by 2050 by as much as 0.5º Celsius.
Moreover, it could save over two million lives annually, while preventing the loss of more than 30 million tons of crops per year.
There is reason to hope that we can reap these benefits.
Under the Paris agreement, individual countries are to achieve emissions reductions according to their own nationally determined contributions.
More than a dozen countries have included SLCPs in their national climate action plans.
Furthermore, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition is working with its 50 member countries, as well as the World Bank and World Health Organization, to cut the super pollutants.
But, to be successful, efforts must go above and beyond the Paris agreement.
Fortunately, progress is being made here, too.
Already, measures to mitigate HFC production and consumption are being pursued through the Montreal Protocol on protecting the ozone layer.
Governments opened formal negotiations last November, and are aiming to reach agreement by the end of this year.
This builds on an impressive phase-out of older chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons and others, that has averted the equivalent of 135 billion tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere, while accelerating the recovery of the ozone layer.
Of course, the reduction of SLCPs should not come at the expense of efforts to cut CO2 emissions.
On the contrary, the world can and must reduce both simultaneously.
And, indeed, efforts to reduce CO2 emissions are also occurring outside the Paris agreement framework.
The International Civil Aviation Organization is working to reduce emissions from air travel, having reached a preliminary agreement on the subject just a few weeks ago.
The International Maritime Organization is pursuing similar goals for shipping.
Warming from any climate pollutant is dangerous and sets in motion a series of potentially irreversible effects, including the continued rise of sea levels, destruction of forests, depletion of Arctic sea ice and glaciers in Greenland and the Tibetan Plateau, and melting of permafrost.
Making matters worse, these effects can reinforce one another, tipping the world into a vicious cycle that becomes ever more difficult to escape.
But if we act fast, harvesting fresh momentum on HFCs under sister agreements like Montreal and a growing array of cooperative coalitions, we can avoid disaster and ensure long-term economic development, including by supporting progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
Simply put, the rate of action on all climate-related emissions will determine our success in eradicating poverty and will shape the world our descendants will inherit.
With governments preparing to sign the Paris agreement on April 22, there has never been a better opportunity to press ahead toward a brighter, cleaner, more prosperous future.
The Secret Sex Lives of Crop Plants
ABERYSTWYTH – Scientists estimate that there are more than 400,000 species of plants on earth, at least half of which are edible for humans.
Indeed, it is entirely possible that we are capable of eating 300,000 plant species.
And yet we consume just a tiny fraction of that.
Homo sapiens, the most cosmopolitan of species, one that thrives by virtue of being a generalist, eats only about 200 plant species.
Remarkably, a mere three crops – maize, rice, and wheat – account for more than half of the calories and proteins that we derive from plants.
Strangely, there have been few attempts to explain why we consume so few of the species that are possible to eat.
Taste is not the answer.
Nor is nutritional value.
The plants we eat have been enhanced by generations of selection, in which farmers have favored those with the most palatability, the greatest nutritional value, and the highest yield.
As much as one might hate broccoli, it is likely to be far tastier than most of the 300,000 alternatives.
Wild plants taste like wild plants because they still are wild plants.
But why is that?
In Guns, Germs, and Steel, the geographer and science writer Jared Diamond argues that the explanation for our limited menu lies within the plants themselves.
Diamond argues that when agriculture was still in its infancy, our ancestors were remarkably efficient at identifying the very few species that were suitable for domestication – by which Diamond means not being poisonous.
The logic seems impeccable, and it is true that the vast majority of the planet’s 400,000 plant species do contain chemical defenses (poisons) to defend themselves from grazing herbivores.
But, unfortunately for Diamond’s theory, many of our most important crops are also stuffed full of toxins, to the extent that if they were introduced today, they would most likely be banned for human consumption.
Examples include the tomato, its relative the potato, and many other root crops, such as cassava, which contains cyanide; taro, which is full of oxalates; and yams, which produce defense chemicals that mimic female hormones.
Indeed, many of the plants we love to grow and eat, including chilies, mustard, horseradish, and wasabi, are attractive precisely because they are packed with potentially harmful chemicals.
What distinguishes food crops from other plants has nothing to do with taste, nutrition, or whether they contain poisons.
The plants we eat are atypical because of their particularly dull sex lives.
Many biologists believe that the reason there are so many species of flowering plants is that each has become dependent on a unique species of insects that coevolved to pollinate it.
In other words, these are plants with elaborate sex lives.
The more unusual the mechanism of insect pollination, the greater the genetic separation among plant populations becomes, almost as if they had evolved on different islands.
This explains why there are roughly 25,000 orchid species.
Orchids are the kinky exhibitionists of the botanical world.
Many of them have extremely elaborate flowers that have evolved to trick male bees or wasps into trying to copulate with them, thereby ensuring that they are regularly pollinated.
This explains why we don’t farm orchids for food.
Seducing bees and wasps might work well for a few individual flowers, but it would never work on an agricultural scale.
There would never be enough male wasps to pollinate an entire crop; and if there were, they would soon tire or wise up.
Furthermore, because wasps are not found everywhere, an orchid crop could never be pollinated outside its original range.
Most food crops, by contrast, can be pollinated by different types of insects.
They can be successfully cultivated around the world, using whatever insects are available to pollinate them.
The most common crops of all – wheat, maize, and rice – are grasses that rely on the wind for pollination.
Others, such as potatoes and yams, are spread vegetatively and are rarely propagated from seed at all, while some crops that would naturally be insect pollinated, such as oilseed rape, become wind pollinated when they are grown on an industrial scale.
A more adventurous plant diet is possible.
But it would have to accommodate the quirky sex lives of what we include in it.
Food for Revolution
PRINCETON – Summits are defined by their location.
It is quaint that the 1933 World Economic Conference took place in the Geological Museum in London’s Kensington, at a time when international cooperation seemed as alien as a fossilized dinosaur.
On these criteria, Deauville, in French Normandy, with the (slightly faded) elegance of a past era of elite luxury, ostentatious consumption, and sumptuous banquets, is also perhaps not an altogether fortunate choice for the G-8 meeting.
This year, the G-8ers are talking about interesting but peripheral issues, such as the economic impact of the Internet.
Worse, they are talking about important issues, like food security, in a peripheral way.
The food issue emerged for the first time as a major theme at the July 2009 summit in L’Aquila, Italy, as a response to a commodity boom that was beginning to falter, but that has since reemerged with the force of a hurricane.
Now the G-8 will discuss funding for palliative measures.
The issue of food is, however, intimately tied to a host of much broader economic issues, which the international community is not properly addressing.
Even though the global economy today looks relatively robust in general, international economic cooperation is more fragile now than at any moment in the post-1945 world.
Weak food security highlights all of the major problems of the modern world non-order.
Economic and financial nationalisms threaten.
There is talk of currency wars, national management and regulation of banking, and growing demand for greater levels of trade protection.
And all of these issues are inter-connected.
The discussion of monetary policy is especially divisive.
Because of low interest rates in the United States, major financial institutions can borrow cheaply in dollars and then chase much higher returns in the major emerging-market countries.
The result creates an impossible dilemma for many of the world’s most dynamic economies.
If they try to clamp down by raising domestic interest rates, they will only attract greater capital inflows.
If they let the exchange rate rise, they might deter some capital inflows, but they would also penalize their exporters and push up domestic unemployment.
Emerging-market policymakers in big countries such as Brazil, China, and Turkey routinely attack the US and its monetary policy as a source of inflation, social tension, and political instability.
The most obvious and dangerous consequence of low interest rates in the major industrial countries is their impact on commodity prices, which is especially pronounced for food and fuel.
As many economists, notably Jeffrey Frankel, have shown, prices on these markets are established by an auction-like process; as a result, commodity markets transmit the effects of monetary expansion particularly quickly.
By contrast, branded products, into which producers have sunk major investments in securing the market, have prices that are much stickier and do not reflect the effects of monetary policy as rapidly.
Higher food prices have had a major impact in expanding the area devoted to cultivation in many countries, and have led to higher output levels worldwide.
Brazil, Russia, and China, but also Algeria, Egypt, and South Africa – indeed, all African countries that have maintained functioning governments – have seen dramatic increases in food production over the past decade.
This should be a happy picture: the world is now better able to feed itself.
But the same economic stimuli that underpin higher food output also lead to supply problems, a decline in living standards, and massive social strains, especially in urban centers.
This is important to bear in mind, because rising food prices have historically been the trigger for political revolutions.
The three revolutions that made the modern world, in France, Russia, and China, all had their immediate origins in food shortages, fear of hunger, and disputes about food pricing.
The panic about bread that swept France in 1789, and the inability of the government to guarantee supplies, destroyed the ancien regime.
Louis XVI was contemptuously called “le boulanger,” the baker.
Wartime inflation destroyed stability in the Russian empire in 1917, as farmers, worried about the declining value of their money, hoarded their output and let the cities starve.
The Bolsheviks came to power on a promise of bread (and peace).
China, too, was paralyzed by inflation after the Second World War, leaving it vulnerable to food panics.
Food prices are usually not limited in their effects to one country alone.
Simultaneous revolutions swept Europe in 1848, in the aftermath of crop failures whose most notorious manifestation was the Irish famine.
Price rises have been a major trigger of the discontent this year in the Middle East and North Africa.
Though the Egyptian and Tunisian economies were expanding quite satisfactorily, people had to pay much more for food.
Moreover, it would be wrong to view this as a purely regional phenomenon limited to the so-called Arab Spring.
The same kind of unrest, in which the countryside is pitted against the town, with both sides demanding more rights, could undermine the political order in China and other big emerging-market economies.
Recent decades have been replete with contagious financial crises that spread disorder from one country to another.
The effects of globalized money are now producing a new whirlwind.
The coming years or even months are likely to see new forms of these domino effects.
As in 1848, the struggle for affordable food is producing discontent that transcends national frontiers, threatens established regimes, and fuels popular demand for a more just political order.
Food for Thought in North Korea
DENVER – Meet any Korean of a certain age, and you will learn about barley season, which begins in February and stretches through the cold months of early spring until the first of the winter barley crop is harvested.
Few South Koreans remember those straitened months anymore, but for North Koreans, hunger in the countryside during this time of year is very real.
In past years, South Korea has been the primary external source of food, through either direct food assistance (for the immediate problem) or deliveries of fertilizer.
But this year, with rising impatience and anger in South Korea toward the North Korean regime, the food and fertilizer is in doubt.
And some analysts in Seoul believe that a dicey political succession in Pyongyang, combined with food shortages in the countryside, could prove too much for the North Korean regime to handle.
The past 12 months have seen some of the most outrageous North Korean behavior in decades.
In March 2010, a North Korean submarine torpedoed a South Korean ship on the high seas, killing 46 sailors – and sinking any prospect of an early resumption of negotiations to implement the North Korea’s 2005 commitment to eliminate all its nuclear programs.
North Korean invective and provocation against the South continued, and in November its military shelled a South Korean-held island along the northern limit line, which has served as the North-South border since the 1953 armistice.
More recently, the regime proudly unveiled a modern, high-tech uranium-enrichment facility.
According to the American scientist who was invited to see it, the facility, in contrast to the regime’s aging plutonium technology, appeared to be state-of-the-art, thus reinforcing the suspicion that North Korea has no genuine interest whatsoever in fulfilling its nuclear-disarmament responsibilities.
When asked why they failed to include this facility in their declaration of nuclear programs, North Korean officials responded cheerfully – and absurdly – that it had been built from scratch only after the collapse of the nuclear negotiations in 2008.
The North Koreans lied in writing not only to the United States, which it has done repeatedly in the past, but also to China, Russia, Japan, and South Korea.
The Chinese have urged the US and others to restart the nuclear talks, but they know that it is North Korean perfidy that has jeopardized the process.
Meanwhile, in the stark North Korean countryside, the regime has invested almost nothing.
Unmanaged rivers regularly overflow their banks and inundate villages during typhoon season, much as they did a thousand years ago.
Irrigation systems remain crude and inadequate to confronting the vicissitudes of rainfall on the often parched and barren Korean peninsula.
This neglect has left North Koreans perpetually on the edge of survival – and often with their palms extended to the international community, especially the South.
For South Koreans, whether to care for hungry North Koreans, who are kith and kin, will be a much tougher decision than for others who see only a distant security problem.
Many North Koreans are already malnourished, their body weight and height substantially lower than that of South Koreans.
According to non-government groups and other humanitarian workers, many North Korean children are showing signs of mental impairment as the lack of essential vitamins takes its toll.
South Koreans increasingly are coming to believe that North Korea will not be in the family of nations for long – that sooner or later (perhaps even in this decade), the North will collapse and its malnourished people will become future citizens of a reunified Republic of Korea.
For this reason, the issues facing South Korean public opinion as it decides whether to help with food assistance are not easy; indeed, they could be quite wrenching.
The division of the Korean Peninsula 65 years ago was one of the greatest – and now most enduring – tragedies of the Second World War.
No one dreamed that a line drawn on the 38th parallel for the tactical purpose of organizing the surrender of Japanese units to Soviet and American forces would become a scar across the Korean peninsula that would create two separate states.
But it did, and, in the wake of the Korean War, that line would become – and remain – one of the most heavily fortified borders on earth.
The Korean people have a historical right to determine their peninsula’s future arrangements, including unification should they so choose.
How this increasingly likely process unfolds will have enormous political and security consequences for the region.
Will China accept a unified peninsula under a US ally?
Will the US take measures to reassure China?
How would a unified Korea affect attitudes in Japan?
But the real decisions – and their consequences – will fall on the government in Seoul.
Would food aid help to ensure the survival of a state whose treatment of its own citizens is among the most abysmal in the world?
If so, and if denying food aid would result in a famine that the North Korean regime could not withstand, what could such a decision mean for eventual relations among Korean peoples living in the northern and southern parts of a unified country?
In the coming weeks, South Korea’s government will confront one of the toughest choices that any government can face: whether the short-term cost in human lives is worth the potential long-term benefits (also in terms of human lives) that a famine-induced collapse of North Korea could bring.
Food for Thought on GM Crops
COPENHAGEN – As the world continues to debate the impact of climate-change while seeking a new global treaty to prevent it, Kenya has endured a prolonged drought followed by heavy flooding. Maize plants have withered, hitting poor rural families hard.
People are starving, and many of those who survive are grossly malnourished.
There is hope: next year, the Kenyan authorities will begin testing maize varieties that they hope will provide high yields and prove more resistant to drought.
But why did farmers in Kenya and other African countries not have access to drought-resistant crop varieties before catastrophe struck?
One reason is that such crops rely on research tools used in molecular biology, including genetic engineering.
African governments have been told that genetic engineering is dangerous, with many Europeans and their national governments – as well as transnational NGOs such as Greenpeace – determined to stay away from it.
Unfortunately, Kenya’s government listened and did not permit their farmers to grow genetically modified (GM) maize, even though it has been approved, sown, harvested, and eaten by both humans and animals in South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, the United States, and other countries for many years.
Although Kenya has a well-functioning and well-funded agricultural research system, the government has not even permitted field tests of GM crop varieties.
Molecular biology has provided excellent tools to address health, environmental, and food problems such as those seen in Kenya. The question is whether decision-makers are prepared to use them.
Obviously, most EU countries’ governments are not.
But why are developing-country governments dragging their feet? Are the risks so high that they justify the suffering that could have been avoided?
GM foods have now been on the market in the US for more than 12 years. Most of the food consumed by Americans is either genetically modified or exposed to genetic modification somewhere in the production process.
There is no evidence of even a single case of illness or death as a result – in the US or anywhere else where GM foods are consumed.
Similarly, GM feed has not resulted in any illness or death in animals. And no environmental damage has been detected.
It is unusual that a new technology has no negative side effects.
Just think of all the deaths that the wheel has caused, not to mention the side effects of much of the medicine we take.
What, then, is the danger of GM foods?
Opponents of genetic engineering in food and agriculture have several arguments, none of which appears to be valid.
First, “genetic engineering cannot solve the hunger and food insecurity problem.”
This is correct: GM foods cannot singlehandedly solve the problem, but they can be an important part of the solution.
A second argument is that “we do not know enough about the effects and side effects.”
Since some of the groups opposing GM organisms destroy the field trials that could give us more knowledge, a more pertinent argument might be that many opponents do not want us to know more.
Third, “we should not play God.”
But if God gave us brains, it was so that we should use them to ensure a balance between people and nature to help eliminate hunger and protect the environment.
Fourth, pollen from GM crops may “contaminate” organically produced food.
This, of course, would be an issue only with open pollinating plants, and only if the definition of “organically produced” excludes GM, something that is difficult to justify, since genes are as organic as anything.
Lastly, some argue that if farmers are permitted to sow GM varieties, they become dependent on large seed producers such as Monsanto, which have patent protection – and thus a monopoly – on the seed.
But private corporations undertake only about half of all agricultural research, whether or not it involves genetic engineering. The other half is done by public research systems using public funds.
Results from such research would not be subject to private-sector monopoly power. The fact that virtually all US maize and soybean farmers, and all papaya farmers, use GM seed indicates that it is good business for them.
Similarly, a large share of farmers – most of them smallholders – in Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, China, India, and other countries, prefer GM seed because they make more money from the resulting crops.
Large reductions in the use of insecticides cut costs for growers of GM varieties, while providing an important health and ecological benefit.
But maybe those who oppose private seed corporations are really against capitalism and the market economy rather than GM seed.
If so, they should choose an issue for their campaign that would be less damaging to the poor and hungry in developing countries.
The global food crisis of 2007-2008 was a warning of what the future may hold in store if we continue with business as usual, including misplaced opposition to the use of modern science in food and agriculture.
European and developing-country governments urgently need to reverse their current adverse position on GM organisms in order to help ensure sustainable food security for all.
Such a reversal would reduce hunger, poverty, and malnutrition; help protect our planet’s natural resources; and slow the emission of greenhouse gases from agriculture.
All that is needed is political will.
Food or Fuel?
When United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon recently visited Antarctica, he was impressed by the melting ice he saw there.
Then he was in Brazil, where he was impressed by the country’s use of bio-fuel to power a quarter of its automotive traffic.
Oil pressed from rapeseed can be used as diesel fuel, and maize or sugar beets can yield ethanol to replace gasoline.
The UN and many countries officially share the view that bio-fuel is one option in fighting climate change.
The United States generously subsidizes production of ethanol from maize, with output there currently growing 12% annually and almost 10% worldwide.
EU countries subsidized bio-fuels production with €3.7 billion in 2006, and intend to cover 8% of their motor fuels from biological sources by 2015 and 20% by 2020.
The Kyoto Protocol allows countries to meet their target reductions of CO2 emissions by substituting bio-fuels for fossil fuels.
But is it really a wise and ethically acceptable strategy to burn food rather than eat it?
If we allow food to be used to produce bio-fuels, food prices will be linked to the oil price, as the head of the German farmers association happily announced.
Indeed, food prices are currently increasing in Europe, because more and more farmland is being used for bio-fuels instead of for food production.
This is not sustainable.
The so-called tortilla crisis, which led to protests in Mexico City in January, foreshadows what we can expect.
The price of maize, half of which is imported from the US, more than doubled in a year, primarily because of production of bio-ethanol.
Mexico tried to solve the problem by imposing a state-administered price ceiling for maize tortillas, combined with duty-free maize imports.
The problem is that advocates of reducing the greenhouse effect by promoting bio-fuels production have not made clear where the land will come from.
In principle, there are only three ways to procure it: by withdrawing it from food or fodder production, from the production of natural materials – particularly wood – or from nature.
The perversity of the first alternative is obvious: there is no surplus food production in the world.
Whoever wishes to grow bio-fuels on land that was previously used for food production must recognize that this would increase food prices, harming the poorest of the poor.
Similarly, to cultivate bio-fuels on land that would otherwise be used to produce sustainable construction materials would drive up the prices of these materials and encourage their substitution by non-sustainable materials like concrete and steel.
This may be unobjectionable on ethical and social-policy grounds, but it certainly would not help the environment.
Wood stores carbon, owing to photosynthesis.
The larger the stocks of wood on earth, in the form of living trees or wooden construction material in buildings, the less CO2 there is in the atmosphere and the cooler the earth remains.
So, taking land for the production of bio-fuels from forests means speeding up global warming, because bio-fuel crops store much less carbon than trees.
To be sure, in addition to the negative storage effect, there might be a positive effect on the world climate insofar as bio-fuels may replace fossil fuels for combustion processes.
But this assumes that the oil sheikhs will extract less oil because there is more bio-fuel.
If they don’t, the positive effect will vanish.
World market prices of fossil fuels will simply be lower than they otherwise would be such that total consumption of fossil and bio-fuels rises by the extra production of bio-fuel.
The remaining alternative is to use land that has not previously been used commercially.
But such land is usually wooded.
The substitution of forests by maize, rape, and other oilseed cultivation reduces the stock of biomass and likewise leads to an increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.
Brazil has cleared huge areas of its jungle in order to produce the bio-ethanol that impressed the Secretary General.
By doing so, the country has done a great disservice to the cause of fighting climate change.
Indeed, every year, the world loses forest area the size of Ireland.
The effect on the atmosphere is equivalent to 18% of annual CO2 emissions, more than from the world’s entire transport sector.
Deforestation must be reversed, not accelerated.
It makes no sense to use land in whatever form to produce bio fuels.
Only producing bio-fuels without the use of additional land is justifiable in terms of environmental and social policy.
This would mean using agricultural and other waste, which would otherwise rot and produce nearly equal amounts of CO2 and methane, an even more dangerous greenhouse gas.
That option should be supported.
But official encouragement of production of bio-fuels on land that would have been used for other purposes must stop.
Food Security Rests on Trade
PARIS – From farm to fork, the international community is facing growing challenges in eradicating hunger and malnutrition.
And yet while some parts of the world are obviously better endowed than others in terms of climate, soil, water, and geography, there is plenty of food to go around.
So why is food insecurity a problem for so many people in so many countries?
What is missing are conditions ensuring that healthy and nutritious food can reach those who need it.
Surplus countries need to be in a position to supply deficit countries, and all the more so now that climate change is undermining the conditions for food production in many parts of the world.
Simply put, ensuring that all households have access to the quantity, quality, and variety of nutritious foods that are necessary for a healthy and fulfilling life requires open, predictable, non-discriminatory, and fair trade.
And that, in turn, can only be assured by the global rules agreed upon at the World Trade Organization – rules that have already underpinned a 270% increase in global trade in food and agriculture products since 1996.
To be sure, the current global trade system is not free of problems, and some countries do not always play by the rules.
Moreover, there are important gaps with respect to disciplining export restrictions (which are meant to reduce uncertainties for import-dependent countries) as well as market-distorting subsidies and trade barriers.
In 2017, the latter amounted to $330 billion worldwide.
Trade rules need to be updated to reflect the market and policy shifts that have occurred – particularly the increasing importance of emerging economies – since the WTO was established in 1995.
Critically, we need to ensure that agricultural trade reforms are on the agenda.
Such reforms should be part of a larger integrated strategy that includes a range of other domestic policies and investments (backed by international assistance where needed).
The goal should be to ensure that more people can benefit from new opportunities in the global economy, and that help is available for those who need it most.
The international community needs to do three things to harness the benefits of trade in food and agriculture products.
First, governments should help farmers (especially family farmers) become more efficient. That means investing in infrastructure (including digital) and education, enforcing land registration and property rights, and supporting research to preserve scarce resources, combat climate change, and improve sustainability and resilience to shocks.
Each is a necessary ingredient for enabling farmers to earn a decent living.
But they might not prove sufficient.
In many cases, governments will also need to design food-security programs such as social-insurance schemes and direct transfers that target the poor.
The second task for governments is to move away from market-distorting, environmentally damaging interventions in the agricultural sector.
Many governments try to improve farmers’ incomes by setting high prices domestically and erecting trade barriers to keep out imports.
But such measures ultimately raise prices for consumers, aggravate resource pressures, undermine biodiversity, and contribute to an increase in greenhouse-gas emissions.
Finally, governments need to anchor these reforms in global rules so that everyone can have confidence that domestic measures will stick.
Whatever shape they take, international rules should be written in such a way that they encourage and reward good national-level policies and investments in agriculture.
The failure to shift agriculture policies more rapidly in the direction outlined above has been costly – to the sector itself and to the international community.
Still, important steps taken by governments toward banning export subsidies show that progress is still possible.
Looking ahead, the top priority should be to tackle the outstanding issues with everyone at the table, leaving taboos at the door.
Policymakers should give a fresh look to domestic support in light of current market and policy conditions.
Moreover, we need to improve market access, and convince countries to commit to a stronger enforcement regime for export-competition issues and export restrictions.
Eradicating hunger, ending food insecurity, and ensuring sustainability are global priorities that call for collective action.
We need to strengthen, not weaken, international cooperation.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the OECD will both continue to support efforts at the WTO to facilitate trade in food and agricultural goods.
And we will intensify our efforts to help countries enact the policies they need for inclusive productivity growth and food security for all.
We Need a Food Revolution
LONDON – In 1984, I gathered the most successful musicians of the time to form a “supergroup” called Band Aid to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.
The next year, an even larger grouping was formed for Live Aid, a major benefit concert and music-based fundraising initiative that continues to this day.
At last month’s International Forum on Food and Nutrition, held by the Barilla Foundation, the enduring – and increasingly urgent – need for efforts to strengthen food security could not be more obvious.
The fate of the Easter Islanders illustrates the world’s current problem.
Sometime in the twelfth century, a group of Polynesians found their way to a remote volcanic island where dense forests provided food, animals, and the tools and materials to build hundreds of complex and mysterious stone sculptures.
But, little by little, the people destroyed those forests, ultimately committing social, cultural, and physical suicide.
Today, in relative terms, we collectively have only a small swath of forest left – and we are rapidly destroying it.
We are running out of land to farm, and the desert is spreading.
The food we produce is often wasted, while almost a billion people do not have enough to eat – a reality that leaves many with little choice except to migrate.
Most media coverage focuses on refugees fleeing armed conflict (think Syria) or migrants seeking better economic opportunities than they have at home (think Nigeria or Pakistan).
But the link between food scarcity and migration is stronger than it might seem to those who are not among the hungry.
For example, the Arab Spring uprisings of 2010-2011, which produced a massive wave of refugees, were triggered by a rise in wheat prices, which led to widespread bread riots that morphed into broader political revolutions.
In fact, many armed conflicts, and the mass displacement they cause, can be traced back to food insecurity.
While the poor South starves, the rich North gorges.
More than two billion of us are overweight, puffed up by low-energy sugars and mass-produced processed foods rich in fat.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, just one-quarter of the food we throw out or squander each year would be enough to feed 870 million hungry people.
Worldwide, one-third of all crops are wasted.
Like the Easter Islanders of the past, we are setting ourselves up for self-annihilation.
Moreover, human-driven climate change threatens to intensify existing pressures affecting food supply and migration.
In a report published last December, the European Commission’s European Political Strategy Center predicted that ever-more frequent droughts and floods will “dwarf all other drivers of migration,” with as many as one billion people displaced globally by 2050.
Even the lowest estimate of 25 million climate-change migrants, the report warns, “would dwarf the current levels of new refugees and internally displaced persons.”
To be sure, some steps are being taken to address food waste and scarcity.
For example, this year, the European Commission proposed cuts in farm subsidies, which contribute to overproduction.
But this approach – framed in terms of “evolution,” rather than the “revolution” that is needed – is not even remotely adequate.
The European Union’s common agricultural policy has long been highly problematic.
The CAP authorized tax money to be spent on growing surplus food, which was then warehoused (at further cost) and ultimately destroyed (at still further cost).
The system has improved somewhat over the years, but not nearly enough.
The farm bill in the United States – the federal government’s primary agricultural and food policy tool – is similarly wasteful.
What is needed is not just a politically tolerable adjustment to existing policies, but rather root-and-branch reform that emphasizes real results.
Unfortunately, it is not clear whether there are any politicians up to the task, whether in the erratic and polarized US or in the ineffectual European Parliament and Commission.
The time to step up was yesterday; the time to adopt a new approach is now.
We can discuss the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals – which include targets like “halving per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer level, and reducing food losses along production and supply chains by 2030” – until we are blue in the face.
What matters are well-designed, effective, and comprehensive policies, implemented in a sustained manner.
And those are nowhere to be found.
The Earth is 45 million centuries old, but our century is unique, because it is the first in which a species could destroy the entire basis of its own existence.
Yet we latter-day Easter Islanders seem unaware of this existential threat, preferring to build statues rather than sustainable systems for survival.
Will we acknowledge our predicament only when our land becomes a desert, when our health systems collapse under the strain, when even the wealthy are facing food shortages, when freshwater becomes scarce, and when our national shorelines are breached?
By then, it will be too late, and our fate will be sealed.
The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it.
Each of us must recognize the seriousness of our situation and demand real action to change it.
That means you.
Feeding a Flawed Society
STANFORD/BERKELEY – Virtually everyone in the scientific community agrees that ensuring sufficient food supplies for a surging human population, which is set to grow by 2.4 billion by mid-century, will require serious work.
Indeed, we have not even succeeded at providing enough food for today’s population of 7.3 billion: Nearly 800 million people currently are starving or hungry, and another couple billion do not get enough micronutrients.
But there is no such consensus about how to address the food-security problem.
The scientific community is split between two main approaches: “tinker with agricultural details” (TAD) and “mend societal fundamentals” (MSF).
While the former approach has support from a clear majority, the latter is more convincing.
To be sure, the TAD camp has identified many important problems with current food production and distribution systems, and addressing them could indeed improve food security.
Yields could be increased by developing better crop varieties.
Water, fertilizer, and pesticides should be used more efficiently.
Maintaining tropical forests and other relatively natural ecosystems would preserve critical ecosystem services, especially soil fertility, pollination, pest control, and climate amelioration.
The trend toward rising meat consumption should be reversed.
Stricter regulation of fisheries and ocean pollution would maintain the supply of marine protein essential to many people.
Waste in food production and distribution should be reduced.
And people should be educated to choose more sustainable and nutritious foods.
Achieving these goals, TAD supporters recognize, would require policymakers to give food security high political and fiscal priority, in order to support the needed research and action.
Responsibility for launching programs to distribute food more equitably would also fall to governments.
But the TAD approach is incomplete.
Not only would its short-term goals be extremely difficult to achieve without more fundamental societal changes; even if they were attained, they would probably prove inadequate in the medium term, and certainly in the long term.
To see why, let us suppose that, in 2050, the TAD goals have all been reached.
More food is available, thanks to higher agricultural yields and waste-reducing improvements in storage and distribution.
Improved environmental policies mean that most of today’s forests are still standing and no-fishing zones are widely established and enforced.
Ecosystems are becoming stronger, with many corals and plankton evolving to survive in warmer, more acidic water.
Add an uptick in vegetarianism, and it appears that the global temperature rise could be limited to 3º Celsius.
As a result, the world could avoid famines by mid-century.
But, in a human population of 9.7 billion, hunger and malnutrition would be proportionately the same as they are in today’s population of 7.3 billion.
In other words, even with such an extraordinary and unlikely combination of accomplishments and good luck, our food-security predicament would still be with us.
The reason is simple: Our societies and economies are based on the flawed assumption that perpetual growth is possible on a finite planet.
To ensure global food security – not to mention other fundamental human rights – for all, we need to recognize our limitations, in terms of both social and biophysical factors, and do whatever it takes to ensure that we do not exceed them.
Based on this conviction, the MSF approach demands that governments take steps to empower women in all areas of society, and ensure that all sexually active people have access to modern birth control, with women free to have an abortion, if they so choose.
At the same time, governments must address inequality of wealth, and thus of food, not least by curbing corporate dominance.
Short of bringing the global population down to sustainable levels, MSF reforms are the world’s only hope.
But, as it stands, implementing them seems unlikely.
The United States, the country that consumes the most, is moving in the opposite direction: women are struggling to hold onto their reproductive rights, wealth distribution is becoming increasingly skewed, and corporations are becoming even more powerful.
If this trend continues, in 2050, governance systems will be even more poorly equipped to deal with the fundamental problems of perpetual population and consumption growth or wealth inequality.
As environments deteriorate from climate change, toxification, and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, people will have less time and energy for governance reform aimed at reducing inequality or preserving the environment.
As a result, those in power will feel less pressure to arrange systems to provide food to those who need it most.
The social-biophysical system is replete with chicken-and-egg subsystems.
Given that there is no obvious single vulnerable point in the system to initiate change, governments must address a range of issues simultaneously.
Key starting points include purging politics of “big money”; introducing a more progressive tax system that effectively caps the income of the extremely wealthy; ensuring that policymakers have a basic level of scientific understanding; and strengthening women’s rights, including access to free contraception.
Just as social and environmental problems can be mutually reinforcing, so can actions aimed at strengthening our social and environmental fundamentals.
Only by focusing on these fundamentals, rather than merely tinkering with the details of food production, can intrinsic systemic linkages work to the advantage of future generations.
Football is War
NEW YORK – The flags are already flying, from Holland to Argentina, from Cameroon to Japan.
Soon the drums will be beating, the trumpets blowing.
Colors will be unfurled, and battle cries will sound.
It’s that time again: the World Cup is upon us.
The late Rinus Michels, also known as “the General,” coach of the Dutch team that narrowly lost to Germany in the 1974 final, famously said, “Football is war.”
When the Dutch had their revenge in 1988 and beat Germany to go on to become European champions, more people danced in the streets in Holland than on the day that the real war ended in May 1945.
On one occasion, in 1969, a football match between Honduras and El Salvador actually led to military conflict, known as the Soccer War.
Tensions between the two countries were already high.
But then fans of the Honduras team were set upon, and even worse, the Honduran national anthem was insulted, and the country’s white and blue flag defiled.
Of course, soccer wars are rare (indeed, I can’t think of another example), but the notion that international sporting competitions inevitably inspire warm fraternity – an idea advanced by Baron de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympic games – is a romantic fiction.
The violence of British football hooligans, for example, reflects a peculiar nostalgia for war.
Life in peaceful times can be dull, and British glory seems a long way in the past.
Football is an opportunity to experience the thrill of combat, without risking much more than a few broken bones.
Even when football doesn’t lead to actual bloodshed, it inspires strong emotions – primitive and tribal – evoking the days when warriors donned facial paint and jumped up and down in war dances, hollering like apes.
The nature of the game encourages this: the speed, the collective aggression.
Tennis does not create frenzy on a national scale.
Not even boxing does, except on very rare occasions, such as when Joe Louis, the “Brown Bomber,” beat Max Schmeling, the Nazi favorite, in 1938.
After all, these forms of combat are between two individuals, not two tribes.
Arthur Koestler was right when he said that there is nationalism, and there is football nationalism – and that the latter is the more deeply felt.
Koestler himself, born in Budapest but a proud British citizen, remained a Hungarian football nationalist all his life.
It helps to have traditional enemies, old hurts, and humiliations that need to be redressed, if only symbolically.
It would be hard for Americans, who are neither very good at soccer, nor cursed by great historical hatreds, to share the joy of the Dutch, say, when the Germans were defeated in 1988, or that of the Koreans when they defeat Japan.
Perhaps the best example of this type of sporting nationalism was not a football game, but the world ice hockey final in 1969, when Czechoslovakia beat the Soviet Union just one year after Soviet tanks rolled into Prague.
The Czech players pointed their hockey sticks at the Russians like guns, and their victory provoked anti-Soviet riots back home.
Clearly, then, whatever de Coubertin might have hoped, cosmopolitanism and cross-cultural brotherhood comes less naturally to human beings than the raw emotions of the tribe.
The tribe can be a club, a clan, or a nation.
Before World War II, football clubs often had an ethnic or religious component: Tottenham Hotspur in London was “Jewish,” while Arsenal was “Irish.”
Vestiges of these markings remain: Ajax of Amsterdam is still taunted by provincial opponents as the “Jew club.”
And the Glasgow clubs, Celtic and Rangers, are still divided by religious affiliation, Celtic being Catholic and Rangers Protestant.
But a common race or religion is not essential.
The French football heroes who won the World Cup in 1998 included men of African and Arab origin, and they were proud of it.
Most successful modern football clubs are as mixed as Benetton advertisements, with coaches and players from all over the globe, but this seems to have done nothing to diminish the enthusiasm of local supporters.
In some countries, football is the only thing that knits together disparate people, Shia and Sunnis in Iraq, or Muslims and Christians in Sudan.
Of course, most right-thinking people are a bit like de Coubertin.
Tribal emotions are embarrassing, and dangerous when given free reign.
After World War II, for obvious reasons, the expression of nationalist emotions was virtually taboo in Europe (not least in Germany).
We had all become good Europeans, and nationalism was for racists.
And yet, since Koestler was right, these emotions could not simply be crushed.
They had to find some outlet, and football provided it.
The football stadium became a kind of reservation where taboos on tribal frenzy and even racial antagonism could be relaxed, but only up to a point: when the taunting of Ajax supporters as rotten Jews degenerated into actual violence, sometimes accompanied by a collective hiss, mimicking escaping gas, the city authorities decided to step in.
Some games have had to be played without the presence of rival supporters.
Not all football games are fraught with negative feeling and violence.
This year’s World Cup might well be a festival of brotherhood and peace.
Few people even care anymore when Germany wins.
But the fact that sport can unleash primitive emotions is not a reason to condemn it.
Since such feelings cannot simply be wished away, it is better to allow for their ritual expression, just as fears of death, violence, and decay find expression in religion or bull fighting.
Even though some football games have provoked violence, and in one case even a war, they might have served the positive purpose of containing our more savage impulses by deflecting them onto a mere sport.
So let the games begin, and may the best team win.
Which is Holland, of course, the country of my birth.
Football Nationalism
AMSTERDAM -- The late Arthur Koestler, born in Budapest, resident of many countries, and writer in several languages, once said that there is nationalism, and there is football nationalism.
The feelings inspired by the latter are by far the stronger.
Koestler himself, a proud and loyal British citizen, remained a lifelong Hungarian soccer nationalist.
It is hard for Americans, whose “world series” are essentially domestic affairs, to understand the emotions engendered in European citizens when their nations compete for the European soccer championship every four years.
For several weeks this summer, the stadiums in Austria and Switzerland, not to mention the streets of European capitals, from Madrid to Moscow, were given to an orgy of flag-waving, anthem-singing, drum-beating patriotism.
Spain’s victory was one of the rare occasions that Catalonians, Castillians, Basques, and Andalusians erupted together in an explosion of patriotic delight.
Football, more than most sports, lends itself to tribal feelings: the collective effort, the team colors, the speed, the physical aggression. As a famous Dutch soccer coach once said, not in jest: “Soccer is war.”
It was not supposed to be like this.
After two world wars, displays of national fervor became more or less taboo in Europe.
Nationalism was blamed for almost destroying the old continent twice in the 20th century.
The kind of exalted patriotism, especially when combined with warrior pride, that is still entirely normal in the United States, was for a long time associated with mass slaughter.
The English, who escaped occupation by a hostile power, and still believe they won World War II alone (well, with a little help from the Yanks), still have a militaristic streak.
They are exceptional.
Hence, perhaps, the notorious belligerence of English soccer fans.
And yet, even as nationalistic emotions were suppressed in polite society all over Europe, the soccer stadiums remained stubbornly in the pre-WWII world.
Just as killing continues to be celebrated in ritualized form in Spanish bull rings, illicit tribal feelings are given full vent in the soccer arenas.
These feelings can be festive, even carnival-like, as they were in Euro 2008.
But they can contain something darker, more aggressive, too, especially when sporting combat is loaded with historical memory.
Games between Holland and Germany, for example, or Germany and Poland, tended, until very recently, to be reenactments of the war; either – and most commonly – as melancholy replays of wartime defeat, or as sweet revenge.
When Holland beat Germany in the semi-finals of the 1988 European Championship, it was as though justice finally had been done.
More Dutch people turned out in the streets of Amsterdam for a night and day of celebration than when the country was actually liberated in May, 1945.
(Sometimes football history gets mixed up with “real” history; the defeat of a superior Dutch team by Germany in the World Cup final of 1974 also needed to be redressed.)
The tribal feelings of Germans were considered, for obvious reasons, to be particularly toxic after Hitler’s Reich, which is why German flag-waving, until recently, was exercised with a slight air of shame-faced restraint that was entirely absent in surrounding countries.
Yet Germans, too, are unable to suppress such feelings.
Older Germans can still remember their famous victory over a superb Hungarian team in 1954.
It was the first time since their ruinous wartime defeat that Germans were able to feel proud of themselves.
Here was a victory they could celebrate. After years of guilt and deprivation, the Germans were back, as it were.
Like everything else, forms of patriotism change over time. Reasons for national pride are varied.
When France won the World Cup in 1998, the French liked to point out the ethnic diversity of their team.
Their main star, Zinédine Zidane, was of Algerian stock. Others had ancestral roots in various parts of Africa.
The multi-ethnic nature of the 1998 champion was widely touted as a mark, not of a long and often bloody colonial past, but of national superiority born from the tolerance of the French Enlightenment and the fraternity of the French Revolution.
In fact, the French were harbingers of a kind. For something profound is changing in Europe, slowly, painfully, but surely.
If ethnic diversity is more and more common in national sides, it is even more marked in clubs.
Clubs, too, often used to command tribal loyalty along ethnic or religious lines, depending on their location in large industrial cities: Irish clubs versus Jewish clubs in London, for example, or Protestants versus Catholics in Glasgow.
Who would have predicted thirty years ago that British soccer fans would have cheered for a London team full of Africans, Latin Americans, and Spaniards, coached by a Frenchman? Or that the national English team would be managed by an Italian?
But ethnic and cultural diversity is not all that has changed the face of European football.
I have never seen such harmony between the supporters of different nations as in this year’s championship.
Perhaps it was due to the absence of England, whose fans include the last bands of amateur warriors.
But the peaceful, carnival spirit that prevailed, the flying of Turkish and German flags side by side in German streets, when the two nations met in the semi-finals, the joint Spanish-German celebrations after the final, all this suggests something fresh.
Not that national feeling is dying, even as a new European spirit is being born.
But at the very least national identities in Europe are no longer quite so colored by memories of war.
No one much minds any more when Germany wins, as it so often does.
The Germans are now much too nice for that.
Yet I have to admit that I still could not suppress a tiny, keenly felt pleasure when Germany lost to Spain.
Perhaps because Spain played more beautiful football. Or perhaps it just shows my age.
The Nuclear Illusion
GENEVA – As delegates from 189 countries gather to prepare for the next Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference, due in 2015, I am reminded of my first official briefing, as a young Australian minister back in the early 1980’s, on United States nuclear strategy.
It was given to me, in the bowels of the Pentagon, by a man with a white dust jacket and a pointer who looked uncannily like Woody Allen.
He did not have much to say about the countless real human beings who would be vaporized, crushed, baked, boiled, or irradiated to death if a nuclear war ever erupted.
The language was disengaged and technical – all about throw-weights, survivability, counterforce, and countervalue targets.
But it was a dazzling account of the logic of nuclear deterrence and the mechanics of mutually assured destruction, which both the US and Soviet Union applied throughout the Cold War.
Thirty years later, our world is not one in which the governments in Moscow or Washington are likely to hurl swarms of nuclear missiles at each other (if it ever was).
Nor is it a world in which China or the US would conceivably ever intentionally start a nuclear war against the other.
Even for India and Pakistan, the risk of misjudgment or miscalculation is much greater than that of deliberate nuclear warmongering.
And, for North Korea – or Iran, should it ever build nuclear weapons – the risk of the regime initiating a nuclear attack is negligible, given that doing so would result in its certain (non-nuclear) incineration.
Not many delegates here in Geneva, even from the nuclear-armed states, would disagree with any of these assessments.
But it is extraordinary how much of the disembodied calculus of my Woody Allen-lookalike still prevails in today’s nuclear policymaking.
Russia worries that its nuclear-tipped missiles, based largely in static locations, might be destroyed on the ground by a preemptive strike by long-range US missiles, and its retaliatory punch weakened by US ballistic missile defense.
Though it can paint no scenario in which this would ever occur, it not only drags its heels on further arms-reduction talks, but insists on keeping a thousand or so of its strategic nuclear weapons on launch-within-minutes alert status.
Not surprisingly, the US refuses to de-alert its own nuclear missiles if Russia will not.
So nearly 2,000 weapons of mass destruction still face each other on high alert, maximizing the prospect of a catastrophe through human or system error or cyber sabotage.
This deterrence logic produces a snowball effect.
With Russia and the US holding 18,000 of the world’s current stockpile of 19,000 nuclear weapons, it is proving impossible to persuade any of the other nuclear-armed states to reduce their own (much smaller) arsenals until the Big Two make further drastic cuts to theirs.
China shares Russia’s concerns about US conventional and missile-defense superiority, and is increasing and modernizing its estimated 240-weapon stockpile.
With China taking that course, India – outside the NPT but with 100 weapons of its own – feels the need to add to its own arsenal.
And Pakistan then becomes even more determined to try to keep ahead of India.
The truth is that none of the nuclear-armed states, inside or outside the NPT, pays anything more than lip service to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons.
The continued seductive power of the Cold War logic and language of nuclear deterrence is the primary reason, though for some states it is clear that the testosterone factor – perceived status and prestige – also plays a role.
The uplifting pro-disarmament rhetoric of US President Barack Obama remains just that.
No nuclear-armed state will set a timetable for a major reduction in the number of nuclear weapons, let alone their abolition.
The size of their arsenals, their fissile material stocks, their force-modernization plans, their stated doctrine, and their known deployment practices all point in the same direction.
All foresee indefinite retention of their nuclear weapons, and a continuing role for them in their security policies.
The implications of this stance are profoundly troubling.
Concern about states in the Middle East and Northeast Asia joining the nuclear club is as high as it has ever been.
But the foot-dragging by the nuclear states on disarmament is making it increasingly difficult to add necessary new muscle to the global non-proliferation regime.
This was obvious at the last NPT Review Conference in 2010, when efforts to mandate stronger safeguards, strengthen compliance and enforcement mechanisms, and inject new life into the control of fissile-material production all went nowhere.
And that sentiment is alive and well in Geneva this week.
Of course, it is irrational for those whose ultimate objective is a nuclear-weapons-free world to support anything but the strongest non-proliferation measures.
But bloody-mindedness is a natural and inevitable reaction when leaders see double standards – “my security concerns justify nuclear weapons, but yours do not” – at work on this scale.
Progress toward achieving a safer and saner world requires all of the nuclear-armed states to break out of their Cold War mindset, rethink the strategic utility of nuclear deterrence in current conditions, and recalibrate the huge risks implied by retaining their arsenals.
It is time for them to recognize that in today’s world, nuclear weapons are the problem, not the solution.
Putting FDI on the G20 Agenda
NEW YORK – While much of the world’s attention is focused on the economic damage being wrought by US President Donald Trump’s trade wars, global trade’s twin – foreign direct investment – has largely been neglected.
And yet, with FDI flows valued at $1.43 trillion in 2017 – on top of the $28 trillion already invested – how these flows are managed matters.
International investment has become an important source of external finance for many countries; for developing economies, in particular, FDI can exceed official development assistance by wide margins.
But if FDI is to contribute meaningfully to economic growth and sustainable development, existing flows must increase even more.
For that to happen, international investment policies need better coordination, and we believe that the G20 is the best forum to facilitate this process.
The current FDI framework – a muddled mess of more than 3,000 agreements – is insufficient to attract the level of investment needed to meet the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals for the year 2030.
For example, some of the world’s largest economies are encouraging domestic firms to “re-shore” their operations and invest more at home.
Many countries are also tightening controls on inward FDI; applying stricter screening measures to mergers and acquisitions; and demanding reciprocal market access in return for investment.
Moreover, an increase in the number of disputes being filed by foreign investors against host countries has challenged efforts to improve dispute-settlement mechanisms, as some countries withdraw from global arbitration forums altogether.
If these trends are not reversed, the result could be declines in FDI flows, and perhaps even the emergence of “investment wars” stemming from the over-politicization of foreign investment approvals.
Yet, increased investment flows obviously are needed to meet global development goals; what is less clear is how to bring them about.
Unlike the global trading system, the international investment regime does not currently have a multilateral organization to facilitate rule-making, monitor policy developments, or adjudicate disputes.
But one can be built, and the G20 is the most sensible place to start. At the very least, the G20 can offer the appropriate level of guidance to help advance FDI policy.
The G20’s members already account for two-thirds of global outward FDI flows.
Moreover, they participate in most investment treaties, and include both developed and developing countries.
Not only is the G20 an important venue for policy dialogue and coordination; it is also well suited to lead on efforts to address key international investment issues.
To be sure, this is not a new idea.
For example, during China’s G20 presidency in 2016, the G20 adopted the “Guiding Principles for Global Investment Policymaking.”
This set of nine concepts was designed to foster an open, transparent, and conducive policy environment for investment, while promoting coherence between national and international rules.
Still, as we argued in a recent policy brief for the G20’s T20 think-tank, work on this issue has only just begun.
In fact, at least three additional steps need to be taken if efforts to improve the international investment regime are to succeed.
First, the G20 should call on other international groupings to conduct analyses of their investment policies to ensure alignment with the bloc’s nine principles.
When gaps are identified, strategies for plugging them must be developed.
Furthermore, to promote compliance and knowledge-sharing – and to chart a course for the negotiation of future agreements – the G20 should facilitate a peer-learning network that links interested governments and regulators.
Second, the G20 should encourage the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) and the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) to intensify efforts to reform their own dispute-settlement mechanisms.
Because dispute resolution is key to any successful investment regime, the process for resolving disagreements must be beyond reproach.
To make certain that it is, the G20 should track progress by requesting regular updates from UNCITRAL and ICSID.
Lastly, the G20 should support the World Trade Organization’s discussions on investment facilitation.
More precisely, the G20 should stress that future agreements need to be compatible with the “most-favored-nation” principle while prioritizing sustainable FDI over other forms of foreign investment.
The G20 can play a leading role in overcoming the deficiencies that plague the international investment regime.
To do this, however, current and future G20 presidencies must provide a home for discussions about action-oriented policymaking.
International investment can avoid the type of tensions currently enveloping global trade, but only if the rules of the game receive the attention they need.
Whose QE Was it, Anyway?
CAMBRIDGE – Between 1913 (when the United States Federal Reserve was founded) and the latter part of the 1980s, it would be fair to say that the Fed was the only game in town when it came to purchases of US Treasury securities by central banks.
During that era, the Fed owned anywhere between 12% and 30% of US marketable Treasury securities outstanding (see figure), with the post-World War II peak coming as the Fed tried to prop up the sagging US economy following the first spike in oil prices in 1973.
We no longer live in that US-centric world, where the Fed was the only game in town and changes in its monetary policy powerfully influenced liquidity conditions at home and to a large extent globally.
Years before the global financial crisis – and before the term “QE” (quantitative easing) became an established fixture of the financial lexicon – foreign central banks’ ownership of US Treasuries began to catch up with, and then overtake, the Fed’s share.
The purchase of US Treasuries by foreign central banks really took off in 2003, years before the first round of quantitative easing, or “QE1,” was launched in late 2008.
The charge of the foreign central banks – let’s call it “QE0” – was led by the People’s Bank of China.
By 2006 (the peak of the US housing bubble), foreign official institutions held about one-third of the stock of US Treasuries outstanding, approximately twice the amount held by the Fed.
On the eve of the Fed’s QE1, that share stood at around 40%.
Spanning a decade (2003-2013), QE0 was the most sustained and uninterrupted surge in central banks’ purchases of Treasuries on record.
It is difficult to determine the extent to which the Fed’s QE1 during the crisis owed its success in bringing interest rates down to the fact that it was being reinforced by what foreign central banks worldwide – notably in Asia – were doing simultaneously.
It is instructive, however, that the Fed’s next two policy installments, QE2 and QE3, were not matched by large foreign purchases and appeared to have only modest effects in financial markets.
After the turmoil of the 2008 crisis subsided, a variety of indices of financial conditions displayed comparatively low levels of volatility (by historic standards) through the spring of 2013.
But that spring bloom of stability soon faded.
A combination of falling oil and primary commodity prices, an over-ripe business cycle, and the Fed’s announcement of its intent to start “tapering” its asset purchases brought the decade-long boom in many emerging markets to an end.
Since then, growth in these economies has slowed markedly, their stock markets have slumped, capital outflows have escalated, and many of their currencies have crashed.
In tandem with this grim turn of events, numerous emerging-market central banks reversed course and began selling US Treasuries.
We would not know about these sales, however, from the Fed’s quarterly report of the Financial Accounts of the US: Around the time official sales commenced, the Fed stopped reporting US Treasuries held by foreign official institutions (a series of data that had been available since 1945).
The report now shows only the aggregate figure, which combines central bank holdings with those of the private sector.
Fortunately, the US Treasury still publishes the information.
As of the end of 2015, the share of Treasuries held by foreign central banks is more than 1.5 times what the Fed holds.
But this figure is significantly down from its peak and, with capital outflows from China and elsewhere showing little signs of abating, is now trending lower.
The fitful and disorderly unwinding of QE0 is most likely overwhelming the effects of reassurances by Fed officials that they will maintain a large balance sheet.
Indeed, tighter liquidity conditions and increased volatility in financial markets are the byproduct of the reversal in the long cycle of foreign purchases.
The unwinding of QE0 does not necessarily imply a decline in the rest of the world’s appetite for US Treasuries.
In times of financial turbulence, US Treasuries have historically been a safe haven for private flight capital.
But the change in ownership taking place now does carry implications for financial stability.
The change from the steady (and often predictable) purchases of the foreign central banks of the 2003-2013 era to the less predictable hands of private investors, who are more sensitive to changes in rates of return, is likely to be the signature of this stage of the global cycle.
Expecting the Unexpected in America
DENVER – When the United States’ new president gets down to work in January 2017, some obvious foreign-policy issues will already be waiting – some more patiently than others.
Some of these will be perennial problems in need of no introduction: North Korea and its nuclear ambitions, China and its global ambitions, Russia and its spiteful ambitions, and of course, the Middle East and its dysfunctional ambitions.
Often, however, the crises that greet a new president are not the ones anyone expects.
When George W. Bush took office in 2001, he expected to increase defense spending, deploy an anti-missile system, and dismantle several longstanding multilateral arms-control obligations.
Instead, the administration faced issues that were completely unforeseen, including Afghanistan and Iraq, and that consumed it for the next eight years.
The same thing could happen again when the next administration takes office.
A few possibilities stand out.
Start with Saudi Arabia.
To anyone paying close attention to the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East, especially the weakening of many of its key nation-states and the rise of extremist violence, a severe crisis in the Kingdom is no dark-horse candidate.
Saudi Arabia has shown remarkable resilience in overcoming political weakness, often by using its considerable oil revenues to buy itself out of trouble and maintain a large royal family that has been an essential source of stability.
That stability may continue, but it is becoming less of a sure bet.
With oil prices experiencing a prolonged slump, and new sources (for example, Iran) coming onstream, the Saudis will not find dipping into financial reserves quite as effortless a proposition as it has been in the past.
To be sure, by the standards of most countries, Saudi financial reserves are enormous; but so are the aspirations of its disgruntled public, not to mention the growing regional problems and the regime’s sense that it must step up its efforts – often financial – to counter Iran’s growing regional influence.
With another aging monarch in King Salman, the Saudis’ day of reckoning in today’s polarized and radicalized Middle East could be approaching.
Then there is Turkey.
In the past, this key regional actor suffered perennial economic crises, bouts of hyperinflation, and occasional military coups that, brutal as some were, seemed to many Turks a welcome respite from weak center-left and center-right governments.
And, despite its economic and political dysfunction, Turkey managed to maintain a positive image, owing in part to its ambition to join the European Union.
Hope always seemed to outweigh the country’s accomplishments, but it was always viewed in Western circles as a reliable partner and ally.
Today, whether owing to “neo-Ottomanism” or just old-fashioned nasty governance under a thin-skinned autocrat (President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan) with Islamist tendencies, Turkey is on many watch lists.
Its intervention in Middle East politics has been furtive and lacking in consistency or clarity.
At first, Turkey seemed to support Syria’s Alawite leadership under President Bashar al-Assad, then switched sides, joining a coalition of Sunni Arab states in the so-far disastrous effort to remove Assad.
In the meantime, Turkey’s longstanding problems with its restive Kurdish minority have returned with a vengeance as Erdoğan has resorted to strong-arming the Kurds into submission, an approach that he has applied to his many domestic opponents, as well the media and civil-society groups.
Turkey’s internal politics have worsened by the day, and the country’s deep divisions, which reflect entrenched historical and sociological fault lines, show no signs of narrowing under a president who seems temperamentally incapable of winning over anyone who is not already a follower.
A resolution of the crisis in Syria would certainly help Turkey, especially given its role as the prime destination for refugees from the chaos there; but the governance shortcomings with which Turks must reckon are profound.
Turkey may muddle through its current predicament (as it has many times before), and maintain its unity and its purpose.
Or not.
Those hardy perennials may return as well.
But the crises they cause may be different in degree and substance.
North Korea is one such case.
Its current leader, Kim Jong-un, seems far more dangerous than his father, Kim Jong-il, or grandfather, Kim Il-sung.
The regime’s proclivity to threaten war against its neighbors did not start with Kim 3.0, of course.
After all, his grandfather actually started the Korean War in 1950.
But Kim’s recklessness, combined with his relentless effort to build deliverable nuclear weapons, may push the North Korean problem to the top of the new president’s agenda.
Finally, there is China.
For many Americans, the risks posed by China lie in its strength.
In fact, the real cause for concern is not China’s strength, but rather incipient weakness, which could plunge the country – and the many others that depend on its economic performance – into crisis.
One hopes that all of the current candidates vying for the US presidency will be up to the challenges – both perennial and unanticipated – that they will face.
In some cases, to be frank, those hopes may be monumentally unrealistic.
In any case, there will be little room for error.
Forget Inflation
MUNICH – To paraphrase Winston Churchill, never have so many billions of dollars been pumped out by so many governments and central banks.
The United States government is pumping $789 billion into its economy, Europe $255 billion, and China $587 billion.
The US Federal Reserve increased its stock of base money in 2008 by 97%, the European Central Bank by 37%.
The Federal funds rate in the US is practically zero, and the European Central Bank’s main refinancing rate, already at an all-time low of 2%, will likely fall further in the coming months.
The Fed has given ordinary banks direct access to its credit facilities, and the ECB no longer rations the supply of base money, instead providing as much liquidity as banks demand.
Since last October, Western countries’ rescue packages for banks have reached about $4.3 trillion.
Many now fear that these huge infusions of cash will make inflation inevitable.
In Germany, which suffered from hyper-inflation in 1923, there is widespread fear that people will again lose their savings and need to start from scratch.
Other countries share this concern, if to a lesser extent.
But these fears are not well founded.
True, the stock of liquidity is rising rapidly. But it is rising because the private sector is hoarding money rather than spending it.
By providing extra liquidity, central banks merely reduce the amount of money withdrawn from expenditure on goods and services, which mitigates, but does not reverse, the negative demand shock that hit the world economy.
This is a trivial but important point that follows from the theory of supply and demand.
Think of the oil market, for example. It is impossible to infer solely from an increase in the volume of transactions how the price of oil will change.
The price will fall if the increase resulted from growth in supply, and it will rise if the increase resulted from growth in demand.
With the increase in the aggregate stock of money balances, things are basically the same.
If this increase resulted from an increase in supply, the value of money will go down, which means inflation.
But if it resulted from an increase in demand, the value of money will increase, which means deflation.
Obviously, the latter risk is more relevant in today’s conditions.
If the underlying price trend is added to this, it is easily understandable why inflation rates are currently coming down everywhere.
In the US, the annual inflation rate fell from 5.6% in July 2008 to 0.1% in December 2008, and in Europe from 4.4% in July 2008 to 2.2% in January 2009.
At the moment, no country is truly suffering deflation, but that may change as the crisis deepens.
Germany, with its notoriously low inflation rate, may be among the first countries to experience declining prices.
The most recent data show that the price index in January was up by only 0.9% year on year.
This deflationary tendency will create serious economic problems, which do not necessarily result from deflation as such, but may stem from a natural resistance to deflation.
In each country, a number of prices are rigid, because sellers resist selling cheaper, as low productivity gains and wage defense by unions leave no margin for lower prices.
Thus, deflationary pressure will to some extent result in downward quantity adjustments, which will deepen the real crisis.
Moreover, even if prices on average exhibit some downward flexibility, deflation necessarily increases the real rate of interest, given that nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero.
The result is an increase in the cost of capital to firms, which lowers investment and exacerbates the crisis.
This would be a particular problem for the US, where the Fed allowed the Federal funds rate to approach zero in January 2009.
The only plausible inflationary scenario presupposes that when economies recover, central banks do not raise interest rates sufficiently in the coming boom, keeping too much of the current liquidity in the market.
Such a scenario is not impossible.
This is the policy Italians pursued for decades in the pre-euro days, and the Fed might one day feel that it should adopt such a stance.
But the ECB, whose only mandate is to maintain price stability, cannot pursue this policy without fundamental changes in legislation.
Moreover, this scenario cannot take place before the slump has turned into a boom.
So, for the time being, the risk of inflation simply does not exist.
Japan provides good lessons about where the true risks are, as it has been suffering from deflation or near-deflation for 14 years.
Since 1991, Japan has been mired in what Harvard economist Alvin Hansen, a contemporary of Keynes, once described as “secular stagnation.”
Ever since Japan’s banking crisis began in 1990, the country has been in a liquidity trap, with central bank rates close to zero, and from 1998 to 2005 the price level declined by more than 4%.
Japanese governments have tried to overcome the slump with Hansen’s recipes, issuing one Keynesian program of deficit spending after the other and pushing the debt-to-GDP ratio from 64% in 1991 to 171% in 2008.
But all of that helped only a little.
Japan is still stagnating.
Not inflation, but a Japanese-type period of deflationary pressure with ever increasing public debt is the real risk that the world will be facing for years to come.
Forging a European Worldview
WARSAW – Some complain that the European Union lacks a “worldview.” In fact, the EU’s problem is that it has too many of them.
Europeans’ common experiences and interests mean that they should have a shared view on global issues.
But the sad reality is that political, social, and economic pressures tend to push EU members and citizens in opposing directions; shared histories, it seems, are an insufficient basis for shared policies.
Nevertheless, the more pragmatic Europe’s policies are, the greater the chances of success, not least when it comes to global issues.
Europeans have a shared appraisal of many of the world’s problems, and often put forward common methods and strategies for coping with them.
For example, on climate change, immigration, and development aid, there is growing consensus, as there is on energy policy and the further development of the European Security Strategy.
Agreement in these areas is not merely a reflection of some lowest common denominators; in each area, Europe has contributed important added value at a global level.
Indeed, Europe’s community of attitudes is becoming synonymous with solutions to world problems.
After all, climate change, energy security, and demographic challenges have been part of the European discourse for many years; now that discourse is starting to be shared by other parts of the world.
The global financial and economic crisis may also be a catalyst for promoting Europe’s vision of a new world order.
The EU vision of a capitalist economy harnessed to social progress and subject to regulation, rather than laissez-faire, is growing in influence.
New economic powers like China, India, and Brazil must find their own ways of addressing social injustice and encouraging equal opportunity for all, and the European model looks increasingly attractive to them.
Yet many differences still separate societies within the EU. There are divergent views on many vital global problems.
And although these differences may grow smaller with time, they occasionally take on an alarmingly clear-cut form, as in the case of the United States-led invasion of Iraq.
It is nevertheless comforting that Europe’s differences on global issues have not had an excessive impact on the EU’s internal dynamics.
The war in Iraq did not delay the Union’s “big bang” enlargement, and was not the reason for the failure of referenda in France and the Netherlands on the Constitutional and Lisbon treaties.
And Europe does need to develop structures and decision-making processes that limit conflicts of interest by offering compromise solutions.
This is the crux of the Lisbon Treaty, which is designed to usher in new institutions and mechanisms aimed at creating more politically cohesive EU external policies.
Transferring more areas of responsibility, such as foreign aid and development policies, to EU institutions helps the Union to adapt to new international realities by underpinning its growing importance as Europe’s decision-making center.
Shaping a shared vision of the world should start with Europe’s immediate neighborhood.
The enlargement of NATO and the EU has embraced a dozen or so states in Central and Eastern Europe and in the western Balkans.
But, despite these achievements, European integration is far from complete, and it will remain so until all European countries can follow the same development path.
This failing was the key reason for the Balkan tragedy of the 1990’s.
Fortunately, the time for armed conflict in that region appears to have come to a definitive end, now that the Balkan states are on the path to NATO and EU membership.
But Eastern Europe, especially Ukraine and Moldova, also must be treated as a region of special importance.
Ukraine’s population of 46 million means it is far too big and important to be left out of any vision of Europe’s future.
Yet the EU’s strategy towards Ukraine has been ambiguous and obscure.
The Orange Revolution’s reform drive has been slowed or even halted by domestic political and economic crises, but also by the Union’s perceived indifference to Ukraine’s fate.
EU leaders lament Ukraine’s political divisions and slow pace of reform, and the country’s leaders need to address these criticisms.
But lack of progress also reflects the EU’s failure to embrace Ukraine.
Reform of a country’s political and economic institutions and its accession to the EU and NATO usually go hand in hand, because the prospect of membership makes painful decisions electorally acceptable.
In short, it is unrealistic of the EU to expect European outcomes from countries like Ukraine and Moldova without making a full commitment to them.
Fortunately, that approach is changing.
The Gas Memorandum signed earlier this year between the EU and Ukraine on the extension and exploitation of Ukrainian gas pipelines is a perfect example; in return for political support and for funding of the extension of its pipelines, Ukraine has agreed to adopt EU rules governing management and access to the gas transmission line.
Ukraine also agreed to implement the relevant EU energy directives as part of its membership of the European Energy Community.
It is a first step towards Ukraine’s eventual full integration into the EU Single Market.
The EU’s current lack of unanimity on many world issues, as well as continental issues such as Ukraine, is no reason for despair.
The trick for the Union is to develop shared solutions and to take joint foreign-policy actions, even when various EU governments see things differently.
Forging Asia’s Missing Links
MANILA – China’s government has just announced that Premier Wen Jiabao will be the main speaker at the 2009 Boao Forum for Asia, where the roster of leaders expected to participate is a virtual Who’s Who of the continent: President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, President Faure Gnassingbe of Togo, Prime Minister S. Bayar of Mongolia, Prime Minister Thein Sein of Myanmar, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung of Vietnam, Prime Minister John Key of New Zealand, and Kopsak Saphawasu, Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand.
Such meetings are vital for Asia, because the continent lacks the dense institutional infrastructure that Europe has built up over the past five decades.
This year’s Boao Forum has become even more important because of the cancellation of the East Asia summit due to the action of violent protestors.
Multinational companies increasingly treat Asia as a single economic space, at least as far as production is concerned.
This, of course, does not mean that Asia is, or is becoming, a single market, but rather that is now something of a tight-knit pan-national supply chain.
But, although Asia is becoming more like Europe in terms of economic integration, political and diplomatic integration lags behind.
So, because Asia lacks such institutional arrangements, personal diplomacy of the type that the Boao Forum represents, like the annual global winter gathering at Davos, remains vitally important.
Indeed, it was at last year’s Boao Forum that Chinese President Hu Jintao began to express public optimism about the positive trends in Mainland China-Taiwan relations.
That rapprochement was possible because Taiwan’s then newly elected vice president was given permission by China to attend the forum, where he was able to meet informally with President Hu.
Last February, I headed a 40-member trade delegation to Taipei.
That mission’s highlight was my dialogue with Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, who stressed the importance of connecting Taiwan to the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area (CAFTA) in the light of warmer relations developing between the Mainland and Taiwan.
At this time of economic turmoil around the world, increasing Taiwan’s formal economic links with China and its regional partners can only benefit everyone involved, because an inevitable side-effect will be a lessening of tension.
Unfortunately, some analysts suggest that a Taiwan-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement of the likes of CAFTA may not yet be possible, so, in the interim, President Ma’s administration is striving to achieve separate free-trade agreements with various ASEAN members.
Understandably, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has taken the stand that Taiwan should seek closer ties with ASEAN countries rather than depend too much on Mainland China, but Ma does not see the two efforts as being mutually exclusive.
From a wider perspective, Ma and I exchanged views on the synergy of an emerging “Central East Asia Growth Polygon” (CEAGPOL) consisting of the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and the Mainland Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Fujian – plus, eventually, Hainan, Okinawa, and Guam/Marianas.
With goodwill on all sides, real advantages can materialize from building up this informal grouping, as it is a gateway to the huge markets of Southeast and Northeast Asia.
An economic bonus of such an effort for the entire region would come from the opening of direct flights and sea transport across the Taiwan Strait.
CEAGPOL could even become a building block for a Northeast Asian version of ASEAN – an “Association of Northeast Asian Nations.”
As a result of historical suspicion between China, Japan, and Korea, Northeast Asia’s economic heavyweights are the world’s last remaining regional bloc that still lacks an inter-governmental organization of the likes of ASEAN.
The European Union is even more instructive, because centuries of war, culminating in the two World Wars of the twentieth century, inspired, rather than deterred, European economic, political and security integration.
At this time of worldwide uncertainty, Asia-Pacific leaders must redouble their efforts to exploit their partnerships and strategic combinations in order to foster stability and growth. The easing of tensions between China and Taiwan can, perhaps, set a tone for all of Northeast Asia.
At the 30th anniversary of the “Message to Compatriots in Taiwan” last January, President Hu offered six proposals to improve relations:
1.
Abandon the Taiwan independence movement;
2.
Stop confrontation and reach peaceful agreements;
3.
Increase military contacts/exchanges;
4.
Discuss Taiwan’s participation in international organizations under the “One China” umbrella;
5.
Establish a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA); and
6.
Promote China’s traditional civilization with strengthened spiritual ties.
There is now real hope that talks along these lines can succeed.
But there is a major obstacle to easing tensions: the proposed $6.5 billion sale by the United States to Taiwan of 30 Apache attack helicopters and 330 Patriot missiles.
China-US talks on defense cooperation had earlier stalled because of such arms negotiations.
They have since been restarted, an olive branch sent to the Obama administration by China’s government.
All three parties involved will need to tread with care to make certain that the thaw in China-Taiwan relations is not set back by this proposed arms deal.
For, if Asia is to begin to build the type of dense institutional infrastructure that has brought Europe peace and prosperity, the flashpoint between China and Taiwan will need to be transformed into a foundation stone of regional cooperation.
Forging Syria’s Opposition
TEL AVIV – Syria’s crisis is now a year old, with close to 10,000 people, mostly civilians, dead and no end in sight.
The country is at a stalemate: the opposition is unable to topple President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, and Assad’s forces are unable to quash the resistance.
Both sides are adamant: the opposition is determined to bring down a regime that it views as illegitimate, sectarian, corrupt, tyrannical, and stained with blood, while the regime’s hard-line core believes that by persevering it will ultimately silence the opposition, whereas any concession would jeopardize its very existence.
Its downfall, they believe, would mean dispossession and death for the regime’s leadership and for a large part of the minority Alawite community from which it is drawn.
Assad and his cohorts are encouraged by the world’s failure to respond effectively to their brutal suppression of the revolt in Homs, and have proceeded to inflict vicious punishment on its survivors as a warning to opponents elsewhere.
This may cow some of Syria’s civilian population in the short term, but it will serve only to exacerbate popular rage, and thus to increase the prospect of a bloody reckoning with Assad and his cronies down the line.
Today’s brutal stalemate is likely to continue for some time.
Diplomatic and humanitarian missions led by former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and current UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Valerie Amos seem as ineffective as earlier efforts by the international community and the Arab League to mitigate the conflict or to facilitate a political solution.
To be sure, the authorities have suffered some defections, with the most significant coming soon after the violence in Homs reached its peak, when the deputy energy minister resigned and joined the opposition.
But, while defections have occurred among the officer corps as well, the regime has maintained its basic cohesiveness.
The army, the security apparatus, and the Alawite community are still solidly supportive.
A large part of the Syrian population – the middle class in Damascus and Aleppo, the Christians, and other minorities – are passive or sitting on the fence, worried that the alternative to the status quo is chaos, civil war, and possibly a radical Islamist takeover.
And Russia and China continue to provide diplomatic cover, with Iran sending material support.
Life in Damascus, despite increasing shortages, seems almost normal.
The regime’s foes, on the other hand, seem undeterred by the killings, continuing to stage protests across Syria.
Armed opposition is spreading, albeit slowly.
The Western countries, Turkey, and most of the Arab world are incensed by the brutal killing and destruction, and pressure to intervene and stiffen international sanctions is building.
But regional and international pressure on Assad has been ineffective.
While the Arab League seemed to act decisively last November when it suspended Syria’s membership, the military-observer mission that it sent to Syria was a farce.
Turkey’s initiatives have lost steam, and the United States and its European allies are merely going through the diplomatic motions; in practice, their efforts imply little serious impact on the regime.
America and the West claim that they cannot act significantly without a UN mandate, which Russia and China are denying them by vetoing anti-Syrian resolutions in the Security Council.
But the truth is that governments in Washington, London, Paris, and elsewhere could do much more without a Security Council resolution.
Perhaps most strikingly, while some governments have closed their embassies in Damascus (citing safety considerations), there has been no systematic severing of diplomatic relations with Syria.
Indeed, there has been no stoppage of flights to and from the country, or any other measures that could tilt the population of Damascus and Aleppo against the regime and bring the crisis to an end.
This ambivalence can largely be explained by Western and Arab concern with the weakness and opacity of the Syrian opposition’s political leadership.
There is a dramatic discrepancy between the courage and tenacity of the demonstrators and fighters in Homs, Idlib, and Deraa, and the Syrian National Front, whose people and factions have failed to formulate a coherent political program, build an identity, and obtain name and face recognition.
Western policymakers and those in the Gulf ask themselves what Syria would look like the day after Assad is toppled.
This was starkly illustrated in the second week of March, when US defense officials vented their frustration with the Syrian opposition in several press briefings.
The regime has been effective in exploiting that uncertainty by spreading the fear of an Egyptian scenario, in which the weakness of secular activists leads to a takeover by the Muslim Brothers and jihadis.
In fact, it is difficult to separate cause from effect.
Recognizing the opposition as the legitimate government of Syria, as was done in Libya, would give Assad’s foes a boost, but, so far, they lack the gravitas that such a bold measure would require.
The opposition must build itself as a credible and attractive alternative to the Assad regime, and the regime’s international and regional critics must assist in that process.
Assad’s regime is doomed.
It has no legitimacy, and it is bound to fall.
But that could take a long time – and come at an alarming cost.
The alternative is an effective opposition that enjoys unambiguous support by the key regional and international actors.
For Turkey, For Europe
Turkey is now, finally, negotiating with the European Commission the terms of its possible membership in the European Union.
But whether “possible” becomes “eventual” remains very much an open question.
Indeed, completing the negotiations is likely to prove as difficult as the decision to start them.
Recall that Turkey made its first application to join in 1959, and that since 1963, the European Economic Community, the forerunner to today’s EU, responded with a delaying tactic: a request for a customs agreement.
At the same time, having never had to take “no” for an answer – and after receiving a series of nods and winks that hinted that membership might one day come – Turkey’s expectation of eventual EU integration became increasingly palpable.
But ordinary Europeans have begun looking at maps, and the geography that they see cannot be denied: 95% of Turkey’s territory and 80% of its population is in Asia.
As a result, the fierce and lively debate – in Turkey and much more emphatically in the EU – about whether Turkey really belongs to Europe has continued, despite the start of negotiations.
Of course, the question of Turkey’s European identity cannot be answered with geography lessons.
At least half of the body of Greek theater and philosophy was produced in Asia Minor.
The first Christian evangelization trips of Saint Peter and Saint Paul were to Turkey.
Later, Ottoman Turkey was for centuries considered a part of the “concert of Europe,” proving indispensable in defining and securing the strategic balance among the European continent’s Great Powers.
Yet this historical evidence is not enough to unite European sentiment in favor of Turkey’s EU membership.
On the contrary, “the Turkish Question” will be resolved on the basis of the current political preoccupations and concerns for the future.
Fortunately, that choice was not settled prematurely and peremptorily: the process that will lead to a final decision was merely allowed to start with the opening of negotiations.
Membership talks can’t help but be long and arduous, if only because adopting the acquis communautaire (the body of EU law) requires that Turkey integrate around 10,000 pages of texts into its legislation.
However, all this now seems to have a serious chance of succeeding.
And yet Turkey scares countless Europeans.
With 67 million people today, and a population that will reach 80 million in 20 years and 100 million in 2050, Turkey is bound to become the most populous of all European nations.
It is also a very poor Muslim country.
To be sure, a few countries in Europe, mainly Germany and Austria, have welcomed strong inflows of Turkish immigration.
But the immigrants have been mostly poor peasants from Anatolia, whose integration has proven to be difficult.
By contrast, Turkey’s large, secular intellectual community, whose cultural background is European, and from which the Turkish state recruits most of its executives, has remained in Istanbul and Ankara.
Europe, then, is frightened by the prospect of more immigration by Turks who find it almost impossible to assimilate.
For the moment, such immigration has almost stopped, owing to rapid economic growth – indeed, the fastest in Europe – in recent years, which is absorbing the country’s available labor and has thus stemmed the flow of emigrants.
Yet the fear remains that membership in the Union will unleash a new human tide.
Economic fears are not the only concern for EU citizens.
Turkey was the theater of exceptional violence in the twentieth century: its participation in WWI fueled hatred and gigantic massacres, with the genocide of the Armenians the last vicious spasm of the Ottoman Empire’s brutal demise.
Moreover, while Kemal Ataturk restored Turkish national pride by creating the secular Turkish republic, his legacy is mixed, for it includes both Turkey’s strong attraction to the West and a militarization of public life.
The latter explains much of the repressive attitude towards free speech and independent opinion that has characterized much of Turkish public life – a straitjacket that has left little room for real negotiations with Turkey’s restless Kurds or for resolving the division of Cyprus.
But Turkey’s EU aspirations mean that it is now being forced to demilitarize its democracy and to find negotiated and peaceful agreements with all its neighbors and future partners – Armenians, Kurds, and Cypriots.
Thus, if Europe manages to overcome its fears and hesitations and open itself to a powerful Muslim state, it will consolidate peace in one of the world’s most dangerous regions.
Indeed, by integrating Turkey, Europe would show that it is not a Christian club, that the supposed “clash of civilizations” need not be fatal, and that the European project, born out of a desire for reconciliation and the need to promote development, can spread its benefits far beyond the Western half of Europe.
In opening itself to Turkey, the EU would finally begin to play its proper role in confronting today’s most daunting political challenges.
For Whom America’s Bell Tolls
These days the Chairman of President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, Ben Bernanke, likes to talk about a “global savings glut” that has produced astonishingly low real interest rates around the world.
But that is the wrong way to look at it.
America certainly does not have a savings glut.
Its savings rate has been distressingly low for decades.
Then the Bush administration’s reckless fiscal policy pushed it lower.
Falling interest rates in recent years pushed up real estate prices and allowed America’s upper middle class to treat their houses as enormous ATM’s, lowering savings still more.
America has a savings deficiency, not a glut.
And the rest of the world?
A global savings glut would suggest that rebalancing the world economy requires policies to boost America’s savings rate and to increase non-US households’ consumption.
But what the world economy is facing is not a savings glut, but an investment deficiency.
Divide the world into three zones: the United States, China, and all the rest.
Since the mid-1990’s, the net current-account surplus of “all the rest” has risen by an amount that one Federal Reserve Bank economist has put at $450 billion a year, not because savings rates have increased, but because investment rates have fallen.
Declining investment rates in Japan, the newly-industrializing Asian economies, and Latin America, in that order of importance, have fueled the flood of savings into US government bonds, US mortgage-backed securities, and US equity-backed loans – the capital-account equivalent of America’s enormous trade deficit.
The investment deficiency in Asia relative to rates of a decade ago amounts to an annual shortfall of $400 billion a year, with the decline in investment in Japan – a consequence of more than a decade of economic stagnation ­– accounting for more than half of the total.
Moreover, investment rates in the newly industrialized economies of Asia have never recovered to their pre-1997-8 crisis levels, and investment rates in the rest of Asia outside China have fallen off as well.
This would seem to call for a very different set of policies to rebalance the world economy.
Yes, the US needs tax increases to move the federal budget into surplus and policies to boost private savings.
But the world also needs policies to boost investment in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.
And here we face a difficulty.
People like me who have been cheerleaders for international integration in trade and finance, as well as for reductions in tariffs and other barriers, have cited three benefits:
· Maximizing economic – and also social and cultural – contact between rich and poor nations is the best way we can think of to aid the flow of knowledge about technology and organization, which is the last best hope for rapid world development.
· Lower trade barriers will make locating production in the poor low-wage parts of the world irresistible to those who have access to finance.
· Freer capital flows will give poor countries precisely this access, as the greed of investors in rich country leads them to venture into poor regions where capital is scarce.
The first reason still holds true.
Maximizing economic, social, and cultural contact between rich and poor remains both the best way to aid the flow of knowledge and the last best hope for rapid world development.
But the second and third reasons look shaky.
Those with access to finance appear to be capable of resisting the urge to locate production in poor low-wage parts of the world (China aside).
Rather than leading rich-country savers to invest their money in poor countries out of greed, liberalization of capital flows has led poor-country savers to park their money in rich countries out of fear – fear of political instability, macreconomic disturbances, and deficient institutions (especially those that protect the rights of bondholders and minority shareholders).
Something may well happen in the next several years to radically boost America’s savings rate by making US households feel suddenly poor: tax increases, a real estate crash, rapidly-rising import prices caused by a plummeting dollar, a deep recession, or more than one of the above.
It would be nice to believe that when the tide of dollar-denominated securities ebbs, the flows of finance currently directed at America will smoothly shift course and boost investment in Asia.
But don’t count on it, especially considering the share of marginal investment in Asia that is aimed, one way or another, at exporting to the American market.
Those outside America, especially in Asia, should regard the unstable state of the US macro-economy with grave concern.
As the seventeenth-century poet John Donne put it, “Ask not for whom the bell tolls – it tolls for thee.”
For Whom Syria Tolls
PARIS – With every passing week, the Syrian conflict increasingly resembles the Spanish Civil War.
The images of warplanes bombing civilians and destroying cities have turned Aleppo into a latter-day version of Guernica, immortalized in Picasso’s masterpiece.
But the real similarities between the two conflicts are to be found in the behavior of the international community’s main actors, which have again taken opposite sides.
On one side stand Russia and Iran, cynically determined to buttress President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
On the other side stand the established democracies, hesitant and ambivalent in their support of the rebels.
In 1930’s Spain, of course, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy fully supported General Francisco Franco’s rebellion, while the democracies reluctantly offered scant help to the Spanish Republic.
There are even deeper similarities.
Many argued at the time that support for republican Spain meant helping the far more dangerous anarchists and Communists at a time when the Soviet threat in Europe was growing.
In that sense, yesterday’s Reds have become today’s “fundamentalist Muslims.”
Indeed, for many nowadays, helping the Syrian rebels is too risky, and might even jeopardize the Middle East’s Christian minorities.
While the Syrian regime is odious, they argue, the choice is between a hypothetical hope of democracy in the Muslim world and the real risk of endangering Christians’ lives.
Unfortunately, therefore, one must choose the status quo.
Of course, Western vacillation reflects deeper strategic and diplomatic factors as well.
Indeed, by shooting down a Turkish warplane that wandered into Syrian airspace, Assad’s regime intended to deliver a clear message to the international community: “Stay out of Syria’s domestic affairs.”
Syria is not Libya, and the political context has changed significantly, with America’s presidential election approaching and a deepening economic crisis in Europe.
Rightly or wrongly, Russia and China believe that the time has come to take their revenge over an arrogant West that deceived them about the true purpose of “humanitarian intervention” in Libya.
This time, they hold the better cards.
At a time when US President Barack Obama is basing his campaign partly on his withdrawal of American troops from Iraq and his plan to do the same in Afghanistan, he cannot take the risk of intervening in Syria.
Meanwhile, the European Union is fighting for its survival, and cannot devote its energies to an uncertain battle.
For the West, the timing of the Syrian rebels’ uprising could not have been worse.
But, despite deep divisions among the rebels, the cost of Western indifference is probably higher than the risk of intervention.
The international community can no longer hide behind the pretense of ignorance.
It lost its innocence decades ago.
When faced with the slaughter of civilians, it can no longer pretend that it does not know.
But, beyond ethics, there are geopolitical considerations.
With the Arab world in the midst of upheaval, what message does the West want to send?
And, with global power in flux, what message is the West sending to the authoritarian regimes that are backing Assad?
These regimes can only read the West’s dithering as a green light for their cynical agendas.
This is particularly problematic in the case of Iran.
The less determination the West demonstrates in Syria, the more the Iranians become convinced that they can play with the international community’s nerves and patience indefinitely.
As Russia and Iran continue to send money and weapons, if not military advisers, to Syria, it is impossible to persist with hypocritical language that can be interpreted only as a formula for inaction.
Threatening the Syrian regime with “terrible consequences” if it were to use chemical weapons means only one thing: “Bomb your civilians at will, but use only conventional munitions.”
The time has come to supply the rebels with what they desperately need: anti-tank and surface-to-air missiles.
Of course, such a choice carries risks.
Do we know the people we would be helping?
After all, such weapons could be turned against the West one day, as they have been in Afghanistan.
And, by involving ourselves militarily in the conflict, even if only by supplying the rebels, we might give a propaganda boost to terrorist groups that are already willing to strike in the West.
Nevertheless, the risks of passivity, indecision, and incoherence are even greater.
The more the West waits, the more radicalized the rebels will become, weakening the standing and influence of moderate forces.
The logic of intervention goes through cycles.
In the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide and the subsequent refugee crisis and war in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa in the 1990’s, a combination of guilt, economic prosperity, and America’s unique international status led to interventions in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and, unfortunately, Iraq. Today, we are in a completely different cycle, dominated by the ghosts of Iraq, the global economic crisis, and the (relative) decline of the West.
When it comes to intervention nowadays, respect for legality has overcome the concern for legitimacy that prevailed a decade ago.
We have gone from one extreme to the other, whereas a middle road would be wiser.
But, above all, let us not forget the lessons of the Spanish Civil War.
It is always dangerous to give the impression of being the first to blink when facing authoritarian regimes.
Exposing Climate Change Obstruction
STANFORD – Twenty-five years after the adoption of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change on May 9, 1992, the world has yet to implement a treaty that effectively addresses global warming.
Now, following President Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris climate agreement, it is time to investigate more deeply the forces driving delay.
Throughout the 1990s, the American Petroleum Institute (API) – the largest oil and gas trade association and lobbying group in the US – repeatedly relied on economic models created by two economists, Paul Bernstein and W. David Montgomery, to argue that pro-climate policies would be devastatingly expensive.
API successfully lobbied for delaying measures to address climate change solutions, using Bernstein and Montgomery’s projections to claim that job losses and economic costs would outweigh environmental benefits.
These arguments were used in 1991, to torpedo the idea of carbon dioxide controls; in 1993, against the Clinton administration’s proposed BTU tax (an energy surcharge that would have taxed sources based on their heat and carbon content); in 1996, against the goals of the UN Conference of Parties in Geneva (COP2); in 1997, against the goals of the UN Conference of Parties in Kyoto (COP3); and in 1998, against the Kyoto Protocol’s implementation.
The API’s lobbying plan was repetitive. It also worked.
The oil and gas industry portrayed the reports it commissioned from Bernstein, who once worked at the Hawaiian Electric Company, and Montgomery, a former deputy assistant secretary for policy in the US Department of Energy, as factual, independent, and products of genuine economic debate.
In the run-up to the 1997 meeting in Kyoto, Japan, for example, the oil company Mobil claimed in an advertisement placed in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times that “the cost of limiting emissions could range from $200 to $580 per ton of carbon,” based on “a study just issued by Charles River Associates.”
Mobil didn’t name who wrote the CRA report (Bernstein and Montgomery were the first two authors) or who funded it (API).
Mobil’s message was misleading, but was the analysis that Bernstein and Montgomery authored truly flawed?
Consider this: they ignored the negative costs of climate change, and suggested that clean energy would never be price competitive with fossil fuels, which is simply not true.
They assumed the result that they claimed to show.
The oil and gas industry was richly rewarded for abusing the public trust.
Americans eventually elected a president, George W. Bush, who bought the industry’s claims and pulled the US out of the Kyoto Protocol.
Sixteen years later, Trump stood in the White House Rose Garden and announced, with equal sophistry, that the Paris climate agreement would devastate the US economy and cost America some 2.7 million jobs, mostly in the construction industry, by 2025.
That accounting, Trump said last month, was “according to the National Economic Research Associates.”
In case you’re wondering, the first two authors of the report Trump cited – just published in March – are Bernstein and Montgomery.
This time, they were hired by the American Council for Capital Formation, a Washington, DC-based think tank and lobbying group with a history of commissioning deeply flawed work used to challenge climate policy.
Throughout the 1990s, the oil and gas industry and its allies perfected the art of blocking America’s support for key global climate-change initiatives.
The maestros, it appears, are back, and their repertoire hasn’t changed.
It never had to.
In addition to commissioning studies claiming that climate policies would hurt the US economy, the industry also consistently claimed that efforts to address global warming would be uniquely harmful to the US, would not reduce the risks of climate change, and would prevent poverty alleviation.
All three of these additional arguments also appear in Trump’s announcement on the Paris accord.
When a tortoise is sitting on a post, you know it didn’t get there by itself.
The reappearance of the same four arguments developed a quarter-century ago by an industry that benefits from delaying climate policies – arguments used with great success precisely because their origin and true purpose were hidden from the public – looks a lot like the tortoise’s four wiggling feet.
If history rhymes, here’s what we may expect in the months ahead: industry-sponsored economic “studies,” flashy online content, think tank reports, and polished front groups posing as grassroots organizations.
These are time-tested components of the strategy used by the fossil fuel industry and others to block, obstruct, and control climate policy.
We must not let the industry continue to obstruct climate policy.
That means following the money that funds the pseudo-science of delay, and exposing the co-opted scholars who feed false images of debate to the public.
The same arguments – and people – used by the fossil fuel industry to block climate policies decades ago are back.
For the sake of humanity, we must not let them succeed again.
Fossil Fuel Follies
BERLIN – If the world is to avoid climate catastrophe, it will have to forego burning almost 90% of proven coal reserves, plus one-third of oil and half of natural-gas reserves.
But instead of implementing policies aimed at realizing that objective, governments continue not only to subsidize the fossil-fuel industry, but also to use scarce public resources to find new reserves.
That has to change – and fast.
In an effort to help spur that change, the Heinrich Böll Foundation and Friends of the Earth International have aggregated key data about the coal industry in the just-released Coal Atlas.
The figures are striking.
According to the International Monetary Fund, post-tax subsidies for coal (including environmental damage) reached 3.9 % of global GDP this year.
G-20 governments are estimated to spend $88 billion per year on exploration subsidies for new fossil fuels.
And a recent report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, Oil Change International, and the World Wide Fund for Nature revealed that from 2007 to 2014, governments channeled more than $73 billion – or over $9 billion per year – of public money toward coal projects.
Leading the way were Japan ($20 billion), China (around $15 billion), South Korea ($7 billion), and Germany ($6.8 billion).
This public investment augments already-substantial commercial funding for the coal sector.
In 2013, 92 leading banks provided at least €66 billion ($71 billion) – over four times more than in 2005.
All of this has gone to buttress an industry that produces a massive share of global emissions – and seems dead set on continuing to do so.
Since 1988, just 35 coal producers, both private and state-owned, have contributed one-third of total CO2 emissions.
The damage their products are causing is no secret.
And yet coal and other fossil-fuel companies have refused to adjust their business models.
Instead, they have actively worked to block efforts to mitigate climate change at the national and international levels, including by funding climate-change deniers and lobbying against renewable-energy targets and successful instruments like feed-in tariffs.
Meanwhile, the coal industry argues that it plays an indispensable role in tackling “energy poverty” – that is, the lack of access to modern non-polluting forms of power, primarily electricity.
It is true that energy poverty is a huge problem, affecting some 1.2 billion people worldwide.
For farmers, who must rely on pumped water to irrigate their crops, this means lower efficiency and productivity.
For households, which must burn firewood, cow dung, and kerosene to cook, it means indoor air pollution that can cause respiratory disease.
For schoolchildren, poor lighting after dark means lost learning opportunities.
But coal is not the solution.
Just the health consequences of coal production and combustion are staggering.
In 2013, Coal workers pneumoconiosis (“black lung disease”) resulted in more than 25,000 deaths globally.
In the European Union, coal combustion is responsible for 18,200 premature deaths and 8,500 new cases of chronic bronchitis per year.
In China, an estimated 250,000 people die prematurely because of coal combustion.
The physical toll carries large economic costs as well, from lost working days to pressure on health-care systems.
Climate change, too, will impose enormous costs, even if strong mitigation and adaptation measures are taken.
For the 48 least-developed countries, the costs of coal will soon amount to an estimated $50 billion per year.
Far from receiving subsidies, the fossil-fuel industry should be paying for climate change.
After all, just last year, the top two fossil-fuel companies – Chevron and ExxonMobil – together pulled in more than $50 billion in profits.
If the world is to have any chance of capping the increase in global surface temperature at 2° Celsius above pre-industrial levels, without being forced to employ dangerous and risky technologies like Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage or geo-engineering, its energy system must be transformed.
First and foremost, world leaders must commit to phasing out fossil fuels, with the explicit goal of leaving 90% of proven coal reserves, one-third of oil reserves, and half of gas reserves in the ground.
They must also end public subsidies for coal as soon as possible, within the next few years, while ensuring that poor and vulnerable communities do not suffer from an increase in energy prices.
Moreover, governments worldwide must hold coal and other fossil-fuel producers accountable for the damage their products have caused, including through a levy on fossil-fuel extraction to fund the Warsaw Mechanism on Loss and Damage under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Existing international law – in particular, the “polluter pays” principle, the “no-harm” rule, and the right to compensation – supports such a system.
Finally, to address energy poverty, world leaders must scale up funding for decentralized renewable-energy projects, including through a globally funded feed-in tariff for renewable energy mini-grids in developing countries.
The fossil-fuel industry’s success in safeguarding its own interests has come at the expense of the health of our planet and its people.
It is time to reform our perverse global energy system – beginning by resolving to leave coal and other fossil fuels where they are.
Storm Warning for the Fossil-Fuel Industry
LONDON – This has been a year of extreme weather events, from the “Beast from the East” that froze much of the United Kingdom in March to Hurricane Florence on the US East Coast and Typhoon Mangkhut in the Philippines.
Scientists generally hesitate to say that any particular natural disaster is the result of climate change, but the overall intensity of storms certainly appears to be linked to the accumulation of human-generated greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere.
But in the minds of many, assigning blame need not wait for full scientific certainty.
There are tens of millions of people whose lives have been severely affected by natural disasters, and perhaps billions who have noticed changing weather patterns in recent years.
Like a growing share of politicians and most of the media, many of these people are becoming convinced that our reliance on fossil fuels is one of the underlying causes.
The fossil-fuel industry is a legitimate target for criticism, given that its products account for the bulk of annual GHG emissions.
“Big Oil” firms, in particular, have been hit by a number of actions relating to their role in climate change.
In addition to protests at their sites in recent years, they have faced shareholder resolutions demanding a shift toward renewable energy sources, divestment campaigns, and a growing number of climate-related lawsuits, particularly in the United States.
Yet, if anything, the political siege of the fossil-fuel industry has only just begun.
Even if extreme weather events do not turn out to be as frightening as climate scientists predict, the public will most likely increasingly direct its ire at the industry whenever there is a major hurricane, flood, typhoon, heat wave, or freezing spell.
Moreover, as awareness of climate change spreads, politicians and the public will need a simple and easy target to blame.
To be sure, one could point the finger at the billions of consumers who drive gasoline-powered cars and rely on fossil fuels to heat and light their homes.
But any politician hoping to win an election would be foolish to blame the voters.
In practice, this means that fossil-fuel firms – particularly those headquartered in OECD countries – will have to navigate an intensely contested operating environment in the coming years.
In terms of shareholder value, managing social and political challenges will be no less important than finding and producing hydrocarbons.
Nowadays, much of the shareholder activism against the industry focuses on the extent to which firms’ hydrocarbon reserves ultimately may prove commercially nonviable as the world shifts away from fossil fuels.
But in the near term, the political backlash against the industry will pose a bigger threat to valuations than will “stranded assets.”
That backlash could come in a variety of forms.
Divestment campaigns are likely to gain steam and attract larger shareholders.
Climate-related lawsuits could begin to extend further beyond the US, ultimately leading to multi-billion-dollar damage awards, as in the cases against Big Tobacco.
Protest movements to disrupt on-shore operations could become routine.
And governments could decide to impose moratoriums on new hydrocarbon development, or to levy punitive taxes on fossil-fuel firms.
In fact, the government of New Zealand recently banned all future offshore oil and gas exploration – a move that other countries ultimately may follow.
Why should anyone shed tears for Big Oil and its investors?
After all, many of the political pressures described here are helpful for tackling climate change, which requires reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and accelerating the shift to renewable energies.
Still, an unthinking backlash against fossil-fuel firms could also have some perverse effects.
Politicians may use it to deflect attention from the slow pace of national energy policy reform.
In most countries, such reform is urgently needed to meet climate targets.
Also, even in a scenario in which the average global temperature increase is kept within 2° Celsius of pre-industrial levels (the upper limit under the 2015 Paris climate agreement), fossil fuels will still need to be produced.
Like a giant supertanker, the global energy system cannot be turned around on a dime.
The shift away from fossil fuels will take many years, during which oil, gas, and coal will remain in demand.
In light of these realities, one risk of the intensified political backlash against fossil-fuel firms is that the industry could be pushed into the shadows.
Instead of shrinking in size or focusing on a transition to renewables, the industry might shift production to private rather than publicly listed firms.
Or production could migrate to less transparent firms in non-OECD countries.
In either case, these corporate entities will be less susceptible to pressure from progressive activists and socially focused investors.
Less scrupulous producers will be happy to keep exploring and extracting with abandon, because they will feel even less obliged than the distrusted bosses of Big Oil and Big Coal to demonstrate that they are helping to reduce GHG emissions.
As the movement to tackle climate change continues to shape its strategy for the years ahead, this is one risk that it must keep in mind.
Financing Climate Safety
NEW YORK – The purpose of the global financial system is to allocate the world’s savings to their most productive uses.
When the system works properly, these savings are channeled into investments that raise living standards; when it malfunctions, as in recent years, savings are channeled into real-estate bubbles and environmentally harmful projects, including those that exacerbate human-induced climate change.
The year 2015 will be a turning point in the effort to create a global financial system that contributes to climate safety rather than climate ruin.
In July, the world’s governments will meet in Addis Ababa to hammer out a new framework for global finance.
The meeting’s goal will be to facilitate a financial system that supports sustainable development, meaning economic growth that is socially inclusive and environmentally sound.
Five months later, in Paris, the world’s governments will sign a new global agreement to control human-induced climate change and channel funds toward climate-safe energy, building on the progress achieved earlier this month in negotiations in Lima, Peru.
There, too, finance will loom large.
The basics are clear.
Climate safety requires that all countries shift their energy systems away from coal, oil, and gas, toward wind, solar, geothermal, and other low-carbon sources.
We should also test the feasibility of large-scale carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), which might enable the safe, long-term use of at least some fossil fuels.
Instead, the global financial system has continued to pump hundreds of billions of dollars per year into exploring and developing new fossil-fuel reserves, while directing very little toward CCS.
Many investments in new fossil-fuel reserves will lose money – lots of it – owing to the recent fall in world oil prices.
And many of the fossil-fuel reserves that companies are currently developing will eventually be “stranded” (left in the ground) as part of new global climate policies.
The simple fact is that the world has far more fossil-fuel resources than can be safely burned, given the realities of human-induced climate change.
Though market signals are not yet very clear, this year’s more successful investors were those who sold their fossil-fuel holdings, thereby avoiding the oil-price crash.
Perhaps they were just lucky this year, but their divestment decision makes long-term sense, because it correctly anticipates the future policy shift away from fossil fuels and toward low-carbon energy.
Several major pension funds and foundations in the United States and Europe have recently made the move.
They have wisely heeded the words of the former CEO of oil giant BP, Lord Browne, who recently noted that climate change poses an “existential threat” to the oil industry.
More governments around the world are now introducing carbon pricing to reflect the high social costs inherent in the continued use of fossil fuels.
Every ton of carbon dioxide that is emitted into the atmosphere by burning coal, oil, or gas adds to long-term global warming, and therefore to the long-term costs that society will incur through droughts, floods, heat waves, extreme storms, and rising sea levels.
While these future costs cannot be predicted with precision, recent estimates put the current social cost of each added ton of atmospheric CO2 at $10-100, with the US government using a middle-range estimate of about $40 per ton to guide energy regulation.
Some countries, like Norway and Sweden, long ago introduced a tax on CO2 emissions to reflect a social cost of $100 per ton, or even higher.
Many private companies, including major oil firms, have also recently introduced an internal accounting cost of carbon emissions to guide their decisions regarding fossil-fuel investments.
Doing so enables companies to anticipate the financial consequences of future government regulations and taxation.
As more countries and companies introduce carbon pricing, the internal accounting cost of carbon emissions will rise, investments in fossil fuels will become less attractive, and investments in low-carbon energy systems will become more appealing.
The market signals of CO2 taxation (or the cost of CO2 emission permits) will help investors and money managers steer clear of new fossil-fuel investments.
Carbon taxes also offer governments a crucial source of revenue for future investment in low-carbon energy.
With international oil prices dropping – by a whopping $40 per barrel since the summer – this is an ideal moment for governments to introduce carbon pricing.
Rather than let the consumer price of oil fall by that amount, governments should put a carbon tax in place.
Consumers would still come out ahead.
Because each barrel of oil emits roughly 0.3 tons of CO2, a carbon tax of, say, $40 per ton of CO2 implies an oil tax of just $12 per barrel.
And, because oil prices have declined by more than triple the tax, consumers would continue to pay much less than they did just a few months ago.
Moreover, new revenues from carbon taxes would be a boon for governments.
High-income countries have promised to help low-income countries invest in climate safety, both in terms of low-carbon energy and resilience against climate shocks.
Specifically, they have promised $100 billion in climate-related financing per year, starting in 2020, up from around $25-30 billion this year.
New revenues from a CO2 tax would provide an ideal way to honor that pledge.
The math is simple.
High-income countries emitted around 18 billion tons of CO2 this year – roughly half of all global emissions.
If these countries earmarked just $2 per ton of CO2 for global financing organizations like the new Green Climate Fund and the regional development banks, they would transfer around $36 billion per year.
By using part of that money to mobilize private-sector financing, the full $100 billion of climate financing could be reached.
Both Big Oil and Big Finance have made major mistakes in recent years, channeling funds into socially destructive investments.
In 2015, these two powerful industries, and the world as a whole, can start to put things right.
We have within our reach the makings of a new global financial system that directs savings where they are urgently needed: sustainable development and climate safety, for ourselves and for future generations.
The Responsible Investor’s Guide to Climate Change
NEW YORK – Around the world, institutional investors – including pension funds, insurance companies, philanthropic endowments, and universities – are grappling with the question of whether to divest from oil, gas, and coal companies.
The reason, of course, is climate change: unless fossil-fuel consumption is cut sharply – and phased out entirely by around 2070, in favor of zero-carbon energy such as solar power – the world will suffer unacceptable risks from human-induced global warming.
How should responsible investors behave in the face of these unprecedented risks?
Divestment is indeed one answer, for several reasons.
One is simple self-interest: the fossil-fuel industry will be a bad investment in a world that is shifting decisively to renewables.
(Though there will be exceptions; for example, fossil-fuel development in the poorest countries will continue even after cutbacks are demanded in the rich countries, in order to advance poverty reduction.)
Moreover, divestment would help accelerate that shift, by starving the industry of investment capital – or at least raising the cost of capital to firms that are carrying out irresponsible oil, gas, and coal exploration and development, despite the urgent need to cut back.
Though no single institutional investor can make a significant difference, hundreds of large investors holding trillions of dollars of assets certainly can.
Indeed, divestment by leading investors sends a powerful message to the world that climate change is far too dangerous to accept further delays in the transition to a low-carbon future.
Divestment is not the only way to send such a message, but it is a potentially powerful one.
Finally, investors may divest for moral reasons.
Many investors do not want to be associated with an industry responsible for potential global calamity, and especially with companies that throw their money and influence against meaningful action to combat climate change.
For similar reasons, many investors do not want handgun manufacturers or tobacco companies in their portfolios.
Yet there is also an ethically responsible and practical alternative to divestment that can help steer fossil-fuel companies toward the low-carbon future.
As active, engaged shareholders, institutional investors can use their ownership (and, in the case of large investors, their public voice) to help persuade companies to adopt climate-safe policies.
American universities are on the front line of this debate, pushed by their students, who are young enough to face the brunt of climate change in the coming decades.
The students are right to be frustrated that most university endowments have so far been passive on the issue, neither divesting nor engaging as active investors.
For example, Harvard University President Drew Gilpin Faust sharply rejected divestment in 2013; the purpose of Harvard’s endowment, she argued, is to finance the university’s academic activities.
Though she did say that Harvard would be an active and responsible shareholder, she offered no details about what such engagement might look like.
Harvard and many other universities (including our own, Columbia University) have long been committed to acting as responsible investors.
Several have committees that advise university trustees on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in their portfolio, most commonly when proxy votes in support of ESG proposals are to be held.
Yet few so far have applied the ESG principles to their endowment’s fossil-fuel holdings.
Despite Faust’s rejection of divestment, Harvard and other universities have long accepted the principle that divestment is the correct choice in certain circumstances.
In 1990, Harvard divested completely from tobacco companies.
Harvard’s president at the time, Derek Bok, said that the university’s decision “was motivated by a desire not to be associated as a shareholder with companies engaged in significant sales of products that create a substantial and unjustified risk of harm to other human beings.”
Many other universities, including Columbia, have done the same.
Today’s students make cogent arguments that the case for fossil-fuel divestment looks similar to the case for tobacco divestment.
Both represent massive risks to human wellbeing.
Before divesting from tobacco companies, Harvard wrote to them, requesting that they address the ethical issues involved in selling tobacco and their adherence to World Health Organization guidelines.
The companies either were unresponsive or challenged the evidence that smoking was linked to disease.
Similarly, in deciding whether to divest, responsible investors like universities should ask four key questions of the oil, gas, and coal companies in their portfolio:
• Has the company publicly and clearly subscribed to the internationally agreed goal of limiting global warming to 2º Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to the limits on global carbon-dioxide emissions needed to meet that goal?
• Will the company pledge to leave business groups that lobby against effective climate policies to achieve the 2º limit?
• Will the company agree to end any exploration and development of unconventional reserves (for example, in the Arctic and much of the Canadian oil sands) that science has shown to be inconsistent with the 2º limit?
• Can the company demonstrate that it remains a good investment, despite the transition to low-carbon energy sources and technologies (for example, by demonstrating its own plans to make such a transition or highlighting its contributions to poverty reduction)?
If companies can give convincing answers to these four questions, they may indeed remain part of the portfolio, and responsible investors can work with them as part of the climate solution, rather than concluding that they are part of the problem and parting ways.
For those companies that duck the questions, including by claiming that the world will not in fact enforce the 2º limit, divestment would make sense on both financial and ethical grounds, as such companies are clearly not prepared to contribute to creating a low-carbon economy.
Of course, the need for climate action does not stop with investors; sustainable consumption and production practices by businesses and individuals must be part of the solution as well.
The transition to a safe, low-carbon future requires all parts of society to act responsibly and with foresight.
As leaders in education, research, and problem solving, universities have a unique responsibility and opportunity to lead, including as responsible and ethical investors.
Climate Leadership Means Ending Fossil-Fuel Production
VANCOUVER/BERLIN – The end of the fossil-fuel era is on the horizon.
With renewables like solar and wind consistently outperforming expectations, growth in electric vehicles far exceeding projections, and governments worldwide acknowledging the urgency of tackling climate change, the writing is on the wall.
And yet somehow, the question central to it all is not being seriously addressed: what is the plan for weaning ourselves off oil, coal, and gas?
That question is becoming increasingly urgent, because governments around the world, from Argentina to Canada to Norway, are supporting plans to continue producing fossil fuels and explore for more.
These governments claim that new fossil-fuel projects are consistent with their commitments under the Paris climate agreement, despite the fact that burning even the fossil fuels in already-existing reserves would push global temperatures higher than 2°C above pre-industrial levels – and thus far beyond the threshold established in that accord.
It is a startling display of cognitive dissonance.
The reality is that limiting fossil-fuel production today is essential to avoid continued entrenchment of energy infrastructure and political dynamics that will make shifting away from fossil fuels later more difficult and expensive.
Important questions about equity will arise: Who gets to sell the last barrel of oil?
Who pays for the transition to renewables?
And who compensates affected communities and workers?
But, ultimately, these questions must be addressed, within a broader context of climate justice.
Climate change has been called the moral challenge of our age.
This year alone, the world has faced unprecedented floods, hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts on virtually every continent.
Yet the real storm is yet to come.
If we are to avoid its most devastating impacts, phasing out coal – climate killer number one – will not be enough.
A safe climate future requires ending the age of Big Oil.
The good news is that social change is not a gradual, linear process.
Rather, it often happens in waves, characterized by “tipping point” moments brought on by the confluence of technological progress, financial incentives, political leadership, policy change, and, most important, social mobilization.
We seem to be closing in on just such a moment.
For starters, technology is advancing faster than anyone thought possible.
Twenty years ago, when we started working on climate issues, we sent faxes, made phone calls from landlines, and developed photos taken on 35mm film in darkrooms.
Another 20 years from now, we will be living in a world that is powered by the sun, the waves, and the wind.
Moreover, popular opposition to fossil-fuel development is mounting, generating political pressure and financial and legal risks.
Ordinary people everywhere have been working hard to halt projects inconsistent with a climate-safe future, whether by protesting against the Dakota Access Pipeline in the United States or the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline System in Canada; by joining the blockade by “kayactivists” of drilling rigs in the Arctic; or by using local referenda to stop oil and mining projects in Colombia.
Recently, over 450 organizations from more than 70 countries signed the Lofoten Declaration, which explicitly calls for the managed decline of the fossil-fuel sector.
The declaration demands leadership from those who can afford it, a just transition for those affected, and support for countries that face the most significant challenges.
Wealthy countries should lead the way.
Norway, for example, is not just one of the world’s richest countries; it is also the seventh-largest exporter of carbon dioxide emissions, and it continues to permit exploration and development of new oil and gas fields.
Proposed and prospective new projects could increase the amount of emissions Norway enables by 150%.
If Norway is to fulfill its proclaimed role as a leader in international climate discussions, its government must work actively to reduce production, while supporting affected workers and communities during the transition.
Canada, another wealthy country that considers itself a climate leader yet continues to pursue new oil and gas projects, should do the same.
Some countries are already moving in the right direction.
French President Emmanuel Macron has introduced a bill to phase out all oil and gas exploration and production in France and its overseas territories by 2040; the Scottish government has banned fracking altogether; and Costa Rica now produces the vast majority of its electricity without oil.
But the real work is yet to come, with countries not only canceling plans for new fossil-fuel infrastructure, but also winding down existing systems.
A fossil-free economy can happen by design or by default.
If we build it purposefully, we can address issues of equity and human rights, ensuring that the transition is fair and smooth, and that new energy infrastructure is ecologically sound and democratically controlled.
If we allow it simply to happen on its own, many jurisdictions will be stuck with pipelines to nowhere, half-built mega-mines, and stranded assets that weaken the economy and contribute to political polarization and social unrest.
There is only one sensible option.
Citizens around the world are championing a vision of a better future – a future in which communities, not corporations, manage their natural resources and ecosystems as commons, and people consume less, create less toxic plastic waste, and enjoy a generally healthier environment.
It is up to our political leaders to deliver that vision.
They should be working actively to engineer a just and smart shift to a future free of fossil fuels, not making that future harder and more expensive to achieve.

The Foundations of Greece’s Failed Economy
NEW YORK – Too many politicians and economists blame austerity – urged by Greece’s creditors – for the collapse of the Greek economy.
But the data show neither marked austerity by historical standards nor government cutbacks severe enough to explain the huge job losses.
What the data do show are economic ills rooted in the values and beliefs of Greek society.
Greece’s public sector is rife with clientelism (to gain votes) and cronyism (to gain favors) – far more so than in other parts of Europe.
Maximum pensions for public employees relative to wages are nearly twice as high as in Spain; the government favors business elites with tax-free status; and some state employees draw their salaries without actually turning up for work.
There are serious ills in the private sector, too – notably, the pervasive influence of vested interests and the country’s business and political elites.
Profits as a share of business income in Greece are a whopping 46%, according to the latest available data.
Italy came in second at 42%, with France third, at 41%.
(Germany’s share is 39%; the United States’, 35%; and the United Kingdom’s, 32%.)
Insiders receive subsidies and contracts, and outsiders find it hard to break in.
Astoundingly, young Greek entrepreneurs reportedly fear to incorporate their firms in Greece, lest others use false documents to take away their companies.
According to the World Bank, Greece is one of the hardest places in Europe to start a business.
The result is that competition for market share is weak and there are few firms with new ideas.
This stunted system springs from Greece’s corporatist values, which emphasize social protection, solidarity instead of competition, and discomfort with uncontrolled change.
These values may well be beneficial for family life; but, even with the best of intentions, they are a recipe for a static economy and stultified careers.
Indeed, Greece’s labor productivity (GDP per worker) is only 72% of the level in the UK and Italy, and a mere 57.7% of that in Germany.
And surveys indicate that mean life satisfaction in Greece is far below that found in the wealthiest EU countries (the EU15).
Contrary to claims by the Greek government, corporatism impoverishes the less advantaged.
EU data on poverty rates in 2010 put Greece at 21.4% – far higher than the mean EU15 rate of 16.7%.
To be sure, Greece saw productivity gains after World War II – but mostly from increases in education and capital per worker, which can go only so far.
Two important sources of broad prosperity are blocked by Greece’s system.
One is an abundance of entrepreneurs engaged in detecting and exploiting new economic opportunities.
Without them, Greece does a poor job of adjusting to changing circumstances (an imperative emphasized by Friedrich Hayek).
Greece’s much-lauded shipowners, for example, were too slow to adapt to containerization, and thus lost their market share.
The other source of broad prosperity is an abundance of business people engaged in conceiving and creating new products and processes – often termed “indigenous innovation.”
Here, Greece lacks the necessary dynamism: venture capital investment flows are smaller, relative to GDP, in Greece than in any other EU country.
So Greece’s economy has scant ability to create sustained productivity growth and high human satisfaction.
Some economists believe that these structural considerations have nothing to do with Greece’s current crisis.
In fact, a structuralist perspective illuminates what went wrong – and why.
For several years, Greece drew on the EU’s aptly named “structural funds” and on loans from German and French banks to finance a wide array of highly labor-intensive projects.
Employment and incomes soared, and savings piled up.
When that capital inflow stopped, asset prices in Greece fell, and so did demand for labor in the capital-goods sector.
Moreover, with household wealth having far outstripped wage rates, the supply of labor diminished.
Thus, Greece went from boom to outright slump.
The structuralist perspective also explains why recovery has been slow.
With competition weak, entrepreneurs did not rush to hire the unemployed.
When recovery began, political unrest last fall nipped confidence in the bud.
The truth is that Greece needs more than just debt restructuring or even debt relief.
If young Greeks are to have a future in their own country, they and their elders need to develop the attitudes and institutions that constitute an inclusive modern economy – which means shedding their corporatist values.
Europe, for its part, must think beyond the necessary reforms of Greece’s pension system, tax regime, and collective-bargaining arrangements.
While Greece has reached the heights of corporatism, Italy and France are not far behind – and not far behind them is Germany.
All of Europe, not just Greece, must rethink its economic philosophy.
The Winning International NGO
MELBOURNE – It has long been clear that many non-state actors have more influence on international policymaking than a great many sovereign states.
No one doubts the impact that major multinational corporations and terrorist organizations can have, for better or worse.
But the role of a number of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) has been more significant than is generally recognized, and what makes the best of them tick is worth exploring.
According to current estimates, there are some 40,000 NGOs operating internationally, with the overwhelming majority focusing primarily on health, education, welfare, economics, industry, energy, the environment, human rights, social policy, and governance- and development-related issues.
A much smaller number – a few hundred at best – work primarily on peace and security issues, though some primarily human rights-focused organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are influential here.
Those that seek to influence foreign-policy outcomes can be typecast, perhaps unkindly, as “thinkers,” “talkers,” or “doers.”
In other words, they tend to be pure think tanks, research institutions, or policy forums (like London’s Chatham House, the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, or the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC); overwhelmingly campaign-focused advocacy organizations (like Human Rights Watch, Enough, Kony 2012, or Global Zero); or field-based, on-the-ground operational organizations engaged in activities like mediation, capacity-building, and confidence-building (like Search for Common Ground, the Community of Sant’Egidio, or Independent Diplomat).
The organization with which I was longest and most closely associated, the International Crisis Group (ICG), is an unusual combination of all three categories.
It is field-based in a way that most operational organizations are, but that think tanks and advocacy organizations are not.
It focuses, as policy-oriented think tanks do, on analyzing complex conflicts and potential conflicts around the world and identifying workable solutions.
It campaigns for the adoption of these solutions, but less at the grassroots and more by direct access to high-level policymakers.
Measuring INGOs’ impact on policy outcomes is more an art than a science.
The most successful, like Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the ICG, have high visibility among policymakers, and produce analysis and argument that – whether publicly acknowledged or not – regularly becomes part of the currency of debate.
Their perceived ability to make a difference is usually reflected in their capacity to raise funds, whether from governments or the private sector.
What does it take for organizations like these to become and remain successful?
My own experience, as both a government insider and INGO outsider, has been mostly in the area of peace and security, but I think the lessons are generalizable.
Four criteria seem to be essential:
First, INGOs must add value, meeting a need that is not currently being met well or at all.
The primary unmet need seen by the founders of the ICG, for example, was to compensate for governments’ growing incapacity, for both security and budgetary reasons, to develop an accurate picture of what was happening on the ground in conflict zones.
Open-source reporting and commentary by the media were not doing much to fill the gaps, because resource shortages, particularly in the quality print media, have long been dumbing down international coverage of sensitive and difficult situations.
Second, successful INGOs are marked by the clarity of their mission.
The most successful tend to be those that find a clear niche and stick to it.
When Amnesty International broadened its focus from traditional political and civil rights to the whole range of economic, social, and cultural rights, it seemed for quite some time to lose direction and impact.
The most insidious temptation to muddy an INGO’s mission occurs when money is potentially available for some project that is not part of its core business, and for which it does not have readily available internal expertise.
In such cases, diversion and dilution of resources and loss of focus is the inevitable result.
Third, INGOs require real independence.
Any INGO in the business of giving advice must be scrupulous about being – and being perceived as – immune from influence by vested interests.
Some organizations, like Human Rights Watch, solve the problem by refusing to accept any government funding.
The ICG doesn’t do that, but it has always been absolutely insistent on saying whatever has needed to be said, and in practice governments have been remarkably tolerant of specific criticism, provided it is well-supported and well-argued.
The final criterion that a successful INGO must meet in order to be taken seriously, at least by government policymakers, is total professionalism.
If you want to meet governments on their home ground, you have to provide a product that, in terms of the depth and accuracy of its research and the style of its presentation, the best of them are accustomed to and demand.
And your management – of finance, personnel, and governance – has to be sustained at the level of global best practices.
The best INGOs develop strong reputations quickly, sustain them indefinitely, and exercise real influence on policymaking.
But they operate in a highly competitive environment, and will be on a fast track to losing their way if they come to be seen as no longer meeting real needs, remaining sharply focused, or being uncompromising in maintaining their independence and professionalism.
Shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution
GENEVA – Of the myriad challenges the world faces today, perhaps the most overwhelming is how to shape the Fourth Industrial Revolution that began at the turn of the century.
New technologies and approaches are merging the physical, digital, and biological worlds in ways that will fundamentally transform humankind.
The extent to which that transformation is positive will depend on how we navigate the risks and opportunities that arise along the way.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution builds on the Third Industrial Revolution, also known as the Digital Revolution, which entailed the proliferation of computers and the automation of record keeping; but the new wave of transformation differs from its predecessors in a few key ways.
First, innovations can be developed and diffused faster than ever.
Second, falling marginal production costs and the rise of platforms that aggregate and concentrate activity in multiple sectors augment returns to scale.
Third, this global revolution will affect – and be shaped by – all countries, and have a systems-level impact in many areas.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution has the potential to empower individuals and communities, as it creates new opportunities for economic, social, and personal development.
But it also could lead to the marginalization of some groups, exacerbate inequality, create new security risks, and undermine human relationships.
If we are to seize the opportunities, and avoid the pitfalls, of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we must consider carefully the questions that it raises.
We must rethink our ideas about economic and social development, value creation, privacy and ownership, and even individual identity.
We must address, individually and collectively, moral and ethical issues raised by cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and biotechnology, which will enable significant life extension, designer babies, and memory extraction.
And we must adapt to new approaches to meeting people and nurturing relationships.
The scale of the challenge should not be underestimated.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution could lead to forms of human augmentation that cause us to question the very nature of human existence – and even sooner than one might imagine.
Consider the impact that mobile technology has already made on our lives and relationships.
As the novelty of wearable tech gives way to necessity – and, later, as wearable tech becomes embedded tech – will we be deprived of the chance to pause, reflect, and engage in meaningful, substantive conversations?
How will our inner lives and ties to those around us change?
These are weighty questions, about which debate will probably intensify in the coming years.
Of course, technology is not an exogenous force over which humans have no control.
We are not constrained by a binary choice between acceptance and rejection.
Rather, the decisions we make every day as citizens, consumers, and investors guide technological progress.
The more we think about those decisions, the more we examine ourselves and the social models on which we depend, the better our chances are of shaping the revolution in a way that advances our common objectives and upholds our values.
In this effort, new forms of collaboration and governance, accompanied by a positive shared narrative, will be essential.
To this end, three key steps are needed.
First, we must continue to raise awareness and understanding of the issues at stake.
Decision-making cannot occur in isolation.
We need an inclusive approach that brings together top minds from all over the world, from both the public and private sectors.
Second, we must develop comprehensive, constructive narratives about how the Fourth Industrial Revolution should develop.
For example, we should ensure that values and ethics are at the heart of our individual and collective behaviors, including in capital and financial markets.
We must move beyond tolerance and respect to genuine care and compassion, with empowerment and inclusiveness becoming guiding principles of our actions.
Third, we must move to restructure our economic, social, and political systems.
It is clear that our current governance structures and dominant models of wealth creation are not equipped to meet current or, more important, future needs.
What is needed now is not small-scale adjustments or marginal reforms, but comprehensive and innovative systemic transformation.
How the Fourth Industrial Revolution progresses will come down to people, culture, and values.
New technologies, however remarkable they might seem, are fundamentally just tools made by people for people.
We must keep this in mind, and ensure that innovation and technology continue to put people first, propelling us toward sustainable and inclusive development.
Once we get there, we can go even further.
I firmly believe that the new technology age, if shaped in a responsive and responsible way, could catalyze a new cultural renaissance that will create the sense that we are part of something much larger than ourselves – a true global civilization.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution can compromise humanity’s traditional sources of meaning – work, community, family, and identity – or it can lift humanity into a new collective and moral consciousness based on a sense of shared destiny.
The choice is ours.
Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution
LONDON – Technological innovation has long triggered diametrically opposed reactions: awe of new possibilities for some; for others, fear of disruptive change.
But most of us don’t even realize what is happening.
We take change for granted.
Human ingenuity is far too little recognized or appreciated, particularly in financial markets.
Investors obsess about more pedestrian concerns: fears about a hard landing in China, the repercussions of falling oil prices, and the risk that some shock could tip a fragile world economy into renewed recession or deflation.
Obviously, worries about global demand conditions are not unfounded – surely the last thing the world economy needs now is renewed stress.
Yet, for all our angst about excessive debt and policy inadequacy, nothing is as important as human ingenuity for delivering improved living standards and investment opportunities.
Indeed, the advent of new technologies holds out the promise of a Fourth Industrial Revolution, the theme of this year’s World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.
The First Industrial Revolution was based on the steam engine. James Watt’s invention, introduced around 1775, powered the nineteenth-century expansion of industry from its origins in England to Europe and the United States.
The Second Industrial Revolution, from the last third of the nineteenth century to the outbreak of World War I, was powered by developments in electricity, transportation, chemicals, steel, and (especially) mass production and consumption.
Industrialization spread even further – to Japan after the Meiji Restoration and deep into Russia, which was booming at the outset of World War I. The Third Industrial Revolution arrived at the end of the last century with the manufacture and diffusion of information technology.
The promise of a Fourth Industrial Revolution consists in advances in robotics, the Internet of Things, big data, mobile telephony, and 3D printing.
According to one estimate, the successful adoption of these new technologies could boost global productivity by as much as the personal computer and the Internet did during the late 1990s.
For investors, the fourth revolution offers opportunities for vast profits, akin to those delivered by its predecessors.
Already, early movers in fourth-generation technologies command eye-popping valuations.
New eras of rising investment, productivity, and living standards are not just possible; they are probable, recurring with increasing frequency.
And they are the result of human ingenuity.
But new eras require more than basic science or garage-based entrepreneurial wizardry.
To be transformative, technology must be adopted and diffused into everyday life.
This is easier said than done.
At the very outset of industrialization, Watt struggled financially and did not successfully commercialize his steam engine until he formed a partnership with the English manufacturer Matthew Boulton.
More important, history suggests that enthusiasm – in macro and market terms – can run ahead of reality.
One does not have to be a “productivity pessimist” (arguing, for example, that the indoor toilet was the last great human invention) to acknowledge that many new technologies deliver less than promised or reward investors only with long lags.
It is worth remembering that early steam power predated Boulton and Watt by nearly a century, and that it took more than a half-century for their invention to overtake conventional water-mill power as the mainstay of nineteenth-century industrial production.
Volta first discovered electricity cells in 1800, but it took another eight decades to introduce direct current as a means of power transmission.
Likewise, ENIAC, the first electronic computer, was developed in secret during World War II.
Computing power and usage grew exponentially over the ensuing decades of the twentieth century; but even as late as the 1980s, the Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow could quip that the computer age was “everywhere but in the productivity statistics.”
For investors, this consideration holds important implications – among them, the need to be patient and to resist the temptation to overpay early.
Initially, identifying losers (who remembers Wang Computers?) may be as important as picking winners.
It is also important to understand how technology can transform seemingly unrelated industries.
The advent of computing power enabled “big box” retailers in the US – Walmart, Staples, Home Depot, and others – to supplant both mom-and-pop stores and the established retail chains of the 1950s and 1960s.
Computational power, together with advances in the logistics of transportation, storage, and delivery, enabled retailing on hitherto unimaginable economies of scale.
Yet today, these same big-box giants are under siege from online retailing, which promises even greater economies of scale and logistical efficiencies, undercutting even the most efficient brick-and-mortar operations.
Ingenuity it is.
But, to paraphrase Joseph Schumpeter, it is also destructive.
In today’s parlance, we speak of “disruptive technologies.”
But no-one should be gulled by jargon: New ways of producing things often kill off old industries and jobs before the full benefits of the successor mode of production are realized.
A certain degree of violence inevitably accompanies human progress.
That is why the executives gathering in Davos this month are discussing how to “master” the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
For all the awe-inspiring promises of technological advance, theirs is an apt concern.
Leading the Middle East Into the Future
SAN FRANCISCO – New technologies are emerging so rapidly that societies in the Middle East are now having trouble coping with their impact.
By affecting everything from the nature of work to what it means to be human, technological changes could prove overwhelming if we do not collaborate to understand and manage them.
Around the globe, entire industries are being redefined and created from scratch, owing to groundbreaking developments in artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.
We at the World Economic Forum have dubbed this wave of innovation the “Fourth Industrial Revolution,” because it is fundamentally changing the way we live, work, and relate to one another. And these changes will be felt as much in Cairo, Dubai, and Riyadh as in New York, Frankfurt, and Hong Kong.
New technologies such as the steam engine and the cotton mill launched the First Industrial Revolution, which was accompanied by historic sociopolitical developments such as urbanization, mass education, and mechanized agriculture.
Thanks to electrification and mass production, the Second Industrial Revolution introduced entirely new social models and forms of work.
And with the advent of digital technology and instant telecommunications, the Third Industrial Revolution, playing out over the past five decades, has connected the planet and shrunk time and space.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution will be no less transformative: individual technologies will be influential, but changes in our social and economic systems will do far more to shape our future lives.
At this stage, there is no consensus on such basic issues as personal-data ownership, infrastructure security, and new disruptive businesses’ rights and responsibilities.
What is needed is a conceptual framework to help businesses, governments, and individuals anticipate the radical technology-driven shifts – in business models, ethics, and social issues – on the horizon.
To ensure the future prosperity of the Middle East, its governments and citizens must ask themselves if new technologies are being designed and adapted to meet real social needs, or if they are simply ushering in change for its own sake.
More generally, we must focus not just on technological progress and economic productivity, but also on how these forces are affecting people, communities, and the environment.
As the Fourth Industrial Revolution continues, four principles should guide the region’s policies and their implementation.
For starters, focus should be placed on systems rather than on any individual technology; only by observing how divergent technological, social, and economic forces interact with one another can any country’s leaders and citizens determine and predict how business, society, and economics may change.
Second, there must be push back against the common fatalistic view that progress is predetermined.
Communities and individuals should be educated and empowered to master technologies for truly productive purposes, rather than being mastered by them for someone else’s ends.
If we fail to harness new technologies for ourselves, we will have surrendered our personal and collective agency, leaving little reason for optimism.
Third, we should design new technologies and systems with the future in mind, rather than blindly accepting change as it comes.
Integrating transformative technologies into our social and economic systems will require close collaboration between stakeholders in government, industry, and civil society.
Otherwise, our future will be decided by default circumstances instead of our own collective judgment.
Finally, social and ethical considerations are not a bug to overcome or override; the region’s shared values should be a central feature of all new technologies.
If technologies are being used in ways that exacerbate poverty, discrimination, or environmental degradation, they have not been optimized for the future that the people of the Middle East want to build.
Investments in new technologies are justifiable only if they contribute to a safer, more integrated world.
No single stakeholder can address all of the Fourth Industrial Revolution’s social and economic challenges, not even government.
The business community, for its part, must create an environment in which technologies are developed and deployed safely, and with social considerations in mind.
Governments, too, must be actively engaged in how innovations are introduced to society.
Policymakers should maintain close collaboration with the technologists and entrepreneurs leading the revolution, lest they fall behind.
And all of us, as individuals, must stay informed so that we can understand and take action on new issues that emerge from the complex interplay between technology and society.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution will usher in systemic changes that demand collaborative engagement. As the countries of the Middle East adapt their economies to the impact of new technology, they will need to consider new ways of working together across public and private spheres.
Because the pace of change will only continue to accelerate, transparency must become greater for all stakeholders, so that every part of society can weigh the risks and rewards of each new development.
We live in an age of complexity, and sound leadership in the Middle East, as everywhere around the world, calls for a wholesale shift in how we think about collaborative engagement for the future.
If we are to avoid the dystopian outcomes that technology can easily produce, we must collectively envision the future that we want to create.
Four Ways Out
BERKELEY – When an economy falls into a depression, governments can try four things to return employment to its normal level and production to its “potential” level.
Call them fiscal policy, credit policy, monetary policy, and inflation.
Inflation is the most straightforward to explain: the government prints up lots of banknotes, and spends them.
The extra cash in the economy raises prices.
As prices rise, people don’t want to hold cash in their pockets or their bank accounts – its value is melting away every day – so they step up the pace at which they spend, trying to get their wealth out of depreciating cash and into real assets that are worth something.
This spending pulls people out of unemployment and into jobs, and pushes capacity utilization up to normal and production up to “potential” levels.
But sane people would rather avoid inflation.
It is a very dangerous expedient, one that undermines standards of value, renders economic calculation virtually impossible, and redistributes wealth at random.
As John Maynard Keynes put it, “there is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency.
The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose…” But governments will resort to inflation before they will allow another Great Depression – we just would very much rather not go there, if there is any alternative way to restore employment and production.
The standard way to fight incipient depressions is through monetary policy.
When employment and output threaten to decline, the central bank buys up government bonds for immediate cash, thus shortening the duration of the safe assets that investors hold.
With fewer safe, money-yielding assets in the financial market, the price of safe wealth rises.
This makes it more worthwhile for businesses to invest in expanding their capacity, thus trading away cash they could distribute to their shareholders today for a better market position that will allow them to reward their shareholders in the future.
This boost in future-oriented spending today pulls people out of unemployment and pushes up capacity utilization.
The problem with monetary policy is that, in responding to today’s crisis, the world’s central banks have bought so many safe government bonds for so much cash that the price of safe wealth in the near future is absolutely flat – the nominal interest rate on government securities is zero.
Monetary policy cannot make safe wealth in the future any more valuable.
And this is too bad, for if we could prevent a depression with monetary policy alone, we would do so, as it is the policy tool for macroeconomic stabilization that we know best and that carries the least risk of disruptive side effects.
The third tool is credit policy.
We would like to boost spending immediately by getting businesses to invest not only in projects that trade safe cash now for safe profits in the future, but also in those that are risky or uncertain.
But few businesses are currently able to raise money to do so.
Risky projects are at a steep discount today, because the private-sector financial market’s risk tolerance has collapsed.
No one is willing to buy assets and take on additional uncertainty, because everyone fears that somebody else knows more than they do – namely, that anyone would be a fool to buy.
Although the world’s central banks and finance ministries have been devising many ingenious and innovative policies to stimulate credit, so far they have not had much success.
This brings us to the fourth tool: fiscal policy.
Have the government borrow and spend, thereby pulling people out of unemployment and pushing up capacity utilization to normal levels.
There are drawbacks: the subsequent deadweight loss of financing all the extra government debt that has been incurred, and the fear that too rapid a run-up in debt may discourage private investors from building physical assets, which form the tax base for the future governments that will have to amortize the extra debt.
But when you have only two tools left, neither of which is perfect for the job, the rational thing is to try both – credit policy and fiscal policy – at the same time.
That is what the Obama administration is attempting to do right now.
Françafrique at 50
DAKAR – This month, Africa’s Francophone countries will mark the 50th anniversary of their independence, and of the ties they maintain with France.
But is there much to celebrate?
Even before French President Charles de Gaulle took office in 1958, he foresaw the wave of revolutionary nationalism that would soon sweep across Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.
As French president, he sought to circumvent that tide by proposing to the leaders of France’s African colonies a negotiated settlement for independence.
To accept de Gaulle’s offer, these leaders had to agree, among other things, to allow the stationing of French troops on their territory, provide France with a steady supply of raw materials at pre-determined prices, assume all colonial-era debts incurred by France, maintain the CFA Franc as their common currency, and grant the French Treasury veto authority over their sub-regional central banks.
De Gaulle got most of what he wanted, and granted independence.
Francophone Africa has been paying for independence ever since.
French troops have repeatedly intervened in Chad, Gabon, Zaire, Central Africa, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire to prop up and protect complacent, corrupt, undemocratic, and incompetent leaders, remove recalcitrant ones, or curb civil unrest.
In Rwanda, France has yet to live down its perceived role in enabling the 1994 genocide.
On the monetary front, the CFA Franc Zone’s member countries dismantled the federal structure that united them during French occupation and erected trade barriers instead.
The CFA franc issued by two sub-regional central banks (BCEAO and BEAC) are not interchangeable.
As a result, regional trade and economic integration have been stifled.
The ensuing economic difficulties were exacerbated under President François Mitterrand, whose prime minister, Pierre Bérégovoy, pursued a strong French franc – a policy that ultimately led to a massive 100% devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994.
And the euro’s appreciation against the dollar from 2002 until very recently meant that the shift in the CFA franc’s exchange-rate peg from the French franc to the euro caused a repeat of that scenario.
With the bulk of their exports denominated in US dollars and their imports priced mainly in euros, chronic structural deficits have wrecked the Franc Zone economies, and the prospect of a second devaluation looms larger by the day.
More appalling is the fact that France guarantees the CFA franc’s free convertibility into hard currency, originally on the condition that all 15 Franc Zone countries surrender 100% of their foreign reserves to the French Treasury.
The amount was reduced to 65%, and then 50%, in 2005, but France still deducts its share directly from these countries’ export earnings.
Moreover, the mandatory 20% foreign exchange cover stipulated in the convention signed with France in 1962 now stands at 110%.
And a foreign-exchange control enacted in 1993 ensures that only France benefits from this capital drain by limiting the free flow of capital to France alone.
The ensuing massive capital flight has bled the region’s economies and eroded their competitiveness.
This is a shame, because the economic situation elsewhere in Africa has been improving in recent years – mostly in Eastern and Southern Africa, where economic integration is proceeding within the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC).
Unfortunately, West Africa’s regional grouping, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), is not as effective.
With the establishment of ECOWAS, the Franc Zone countries created two sub-regional groupings, WAEMU and CEMAC, in a bid to curb British, American, and Nigerian influence.
As a result, West African countries are mostly missing out on Africa’s current revival – and the prospect of a prolonged period of stagnation in the eurozone certainly won’t help.
The imbalanced relationship between France and its former African colonies would beggar belief if the psychology of Africa’s “liberators” 50 years ago were overlooked.
Senegal’s first president, Léopold Sédar Senghor, was a strong believer in white supremacy who once wrote that “reason is Helennic; emotion is Negro.”
Leon Mba, the first Gabonese president, was such a Francophile that he bequeathed his personal fortune to France in order to finance the construction of a hospital in Paris.
Similarly, the founder of Côte d’Ivoire, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, coined the word “Françafrique” to underline the total osmosis between France and its former colonies.
Houphouët-Boigny’s support for France’s African policy led him to establish diplomatic ties with South Africa’s apartheid regime and make his country a supply-transit route for the Biafra secessionists.
These leaders were unlikely ever to dispute France’s Diktat, and the same applies to their heirs.
Indicted French child abductors were freed by Chad at France’s request.
In Mali, several suspected terrorists – members of a local branch of Al Qaeda – were set free in exchange for a lone French hostage.
Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade once labeled the CFA franc a colonial relic – but that was when he was an opposition leader.
Now he considers it the best currency in the world.
This economic and psychological status quo ensures that, after 50 years of independence, true emancipation for Françafrique will remain a distant prospect.
If there is something to celebrate, it is that the balance of global economic power is shifting to emerging countries, and that new role models and a new generation raised in a globalized world are becoming ready to assume the mantle of leadership.
France and Germany Must Act in Iraq
Next week, President Bush, President Chirac, and Chancellor Schroeder will meet on the cliffs of Normandy to mark the 60th anniversary of the D-Day invasions that led to the liberation of Europe.
They should also seize the moment to liberate themselves from the bitterness that has divided the Atlantic Alliance over the Iraq War, argue Pierre Lellouche and Christoph Bertram.
When the United States launched the war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, France and Germany rightly warned that the invasion could well end up worsening instability in the Middle East and increase the threat of radical Islamic terror.
But now that America and its coalition have proven themselves to be incapable of bringing stability to Iraq on their own, the French and German governments can no longer rest and smugly say, "I told you so," as the situation deteriorates even further.
Both governments must now become seriously and fully engaged in what must now be a united Western effort.
Of course, it would be best for everyone - France and Germany included - if the current US-led coalition were to succeed and Iraq could turn into a pillar of Middle East stability and modernization.
Yet, however desirable this outcome, it is no longer likely (if it ever was).
Internal stability and economic recovery continue to be elusive, with the specter of civil war hovering ever closer.
A divided Iraq at war with itself would be a disaster for the region, for America's international credibility and authority, and for transatlantic relations.
In an already fragile region, a major Arab country like Iraq would most likely prompt interventions by its nervous neighbors - of which there is no shortage - if it turns into a failed state.
Instead of the rule of law, there would be the law of the mafia, of terrorist groups, and of tribal militias.
Many of them are already in place.
Instead of moving toward modernization and development, the region would be confirmed as a cockpit for conflict, a threat to itself and to the world beyond.
Were the US forced to withdraw in failure, Islamic terrorist groups would claim a historic victory, promising more bloodshed for the West.
Moreover, America might also once again retreat bitterly into isolationism, blaming her failure on the UN and on disloyal European allies.
So the stakes are high in Iraq, for Europeans no less than for Americans.
That is why it is time that even those who have been most skeptical about US policy in Iraq start to do something about it.
Both Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schroeder have repeatedly pronounced that what happens in Iraq is a strategic challenge to their countries. Yet their actions in response to this insight have been modest.
The recent turmoil in Iraq has, on the contrary, strengthened those in both capitals who argue that there is now even less reason to get involved on the ground.
At the very least, France and Germany are demanding that the Bush administration openly admit to its failure and the need for help.
Yet not only is such a demand naïve, with the Bush team battling for re-election, it is not at all certain that most of America's European allies would heed a US call for solidarity if one were issued.
Confronting the threat that an unsettled Iraq poses to Europe and to the transatlantic relationship implies stopping these tactical games.
The passing of authority in Iraq from the US-led coalition to an Iraqi government and the need for a much stronger UN role now offers the chance and imposes the need for everyone to stop posturing and get serious.
For their part, EU governments should provide the UN - on whose involvement in Iraq they have long insisted - with the protective force it needs to prepare nation-wide elections in Iraq later in the year, and ask others to join.
A UN staff protected by US marines simply cannot do that job.
With the consent of both the US and Iraq's new leadership, EU governments should also offer to organize an international conference uniting all those with a stake in Iraqi stability, including Iraq's neighbors, to work out a strategy and commit resources in order to save Iraq from slipping into protracted turmoil.
If Europe is to act, France and Germany must lead.
Precisely because they opposed the war, they are now the only countries that can restore Europe's unity of action in promoting stability.
France professes to bearing a special responsibility for international order, but so does Germany; only a few weeks ago, Chancellor Schroeder based his claim to a permanent German seat in the UN Security Council on Germany's readiness to shoulder such responsibilities.
Of all the crisis regions in the world today, instability in Iraq constitutes the greatest challenge to international order.
But France and Germany can also block European responsibility for international order and for solidarity with a US facing possible defeat in Iraq.
The decision is theirs.
It is time for both to realize that the consequences of inaction will be no less severe for the region than for the Atlantic relationship.
The Battle of the Burkini
LONDON – There has been a lot of fuss lately about the handful of Muslim women who choose to bathe on French beaches wearing a special garment that covers the head (not the face), and much of the body.
That garment – the so-called burkini – was invented in 2004 by an Australian-Lebanese woman named Aheda Zanetti, with the goal of enabling even the strictest Muslim women to swim or play sports in public.
Little did Zanetti know that her creation would generate a national controversy.
The imbroglio started when mayors in several southern French seaside towns banned burkinis on their beaches.
A grotesque photograph soon appeared in newspapers around the world of three armed French policemen forcing a woman to undress on a beach in Nice.
Though the ban has now been invalidated by France’s highest court, it is still enforced in several seaside resorts.
And, indeed, the controversy is far from over.
Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is now running for a new term, recently called the burkini a “provocation,” while Lionnel Luca, the mayor of Villeneuve-Loubet, spoke of “rampant Islamization.”
The equally outraged Prime Minister Manuel Valls has called bare breasts a symbol of French republican liberty.
After all, he concluded, wasn’t Marianne, the female symbol of the French Republic, usually depicted with her breasts exposed?
There is little doubt that Sarkozy’s opposition to the burkini is entirely opportunistic.
The controversy represents yet another opportunity to stoke prejudice against an unpopular minority, in the hope of siphoning votes from the far-right National Front’s Marine Le Pen in the 2017 election.
But, in a tradition that spans centuries of European missionary zeal, his opportunism has been cloaked in moral terms: “We don’t imprison women behind fabric.”
Sarkozy would have us believe that the ban on burkinis is really meant to liberate Muslim women from primitive restrictions imposed by authoritarian Muslim men, just as British colonial rulers once liberated Indian Hindu widows from being burned alive to accompany their spouses in death.
This reflects a broader tendency, which has been gaining traction since the end of the last century, to couch anti-Muslim rhetoric in the language of human rights, as though equal rights for women or gays were ancient Western customs that must be defended against alien religious bigotry.
In Valls’s version of history, public nudity is a cherished French tradition and a sign of freedom.
To be fully French, it seems, women must, like Marianne, bare their breasts.
Yet, in the nineteenth century, when Marianne became a symbol of the French Republic, nudity was acceptable only in an idealized form, in paintings or sculptures of Greek deities and other mythical heroines.
It was fine to gaze at the breasts of a painted nude Marianne or Venus; but for a real, living woman to expose even part of her ankle was considered highly improper.
Of course, nowadays, these attitudes are rare in the Western world.
So even though Valls’s version of history is skewed, one might argue that European Muslims who insist that women of their faith should be covered up are out of step – especially given that women sometimes have little choice in the matter.
Indeed, in some immigrant areas, Muslim women feel obliged to cover their heads, lest Muslim men see them as prostitutes, who may be molested with impunity.
But this is not always the case.
Some Muslim women actually choose to wear a hijab and, in rare cases, a burkini.
The question is whether the state should be determining what citizens should or should not wear.
The French republican answer is that people may wear whatever they like in private, but must conform to secular rules in public.
In recent years, however, those rules have been applied more strictly to Muslims than to members of any other faith.
I have not heard of policemen forcing orthodox Jewish women to bare their heads by ripping off their wigs.
Well, some might argue, orthodox Jews are not responsible for massacres in the name of their religion.
And that is true.
But the assumption that women in burkinis are all potential terrorists is farfetched.
A woman lying on a beach in a body-covering swimsuit is probably the least likely person to start shooting or bombing.
As for the argument that Muslim women need the state to free them from Muslim men who force them to wrap their heads in scarves or cover up their bodies, the question is whether this is worth depriving other women of their choice to appear in public in these ways.
I am inclined to doubt that it is.
The best way to help women escape from domestic authoritarianism is to encourage them to lead public lives as well, in schools, in offices, and on beaches.
It is better for a woman to be educated in a headscarf than not to be educated at all.
For certain public functions, it is perfectly legitimate to ask people to show their faces.
Some jobs come with certain dress codes.
Private companies can insist on their own rules; there is no need for national legislation.
The excessive imposition of conformity by the state can actually have the opposite effect than what is intended.
Forcing people to adhere to a common identity fosters a rebellious insistence on difference.
It is no good telling people named Fatima or Mohammed that they are French and must adhere to the norms laid down by Sarkozy or Valls, if they are not treated as equals by people called Nicolas or Marianne.
Wearing a headscarf, beard, or bodysuit can be a harmless way for humiliated people to defend their pride.
Take away that pride, and defensiveness can swiftly become less harmless.
Sustaining Europe’s Security Trio
BERLIN – Despite the tensions generated by Brexit, the leaders of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have stood together in disputes between the European Union and the United States.
If their unity can be sustained, Europe’s “big three” (E3) will serve the EU very well in a tumultuous future.
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and UK Prime Minister Theresa May seem to have read from the same script regarding US President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and his rejection of the final communiqué of the G7 summit in June.
They all disapprove of Trump’s decisions to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and to withdraw the US from the United Nations Human Rights Council.
And they have all criticized his escalating trade war with China.
This unity is not merely rhetorical.
The UK has lately supported EU integration projects concerning foreign and security policy – much more so than before the Brexit referendum.
This includes the decision to establish new headquarters for military training missions – which many view as the nucleus for a potential European military – in Africa.
Britain had long resisted this initiative.
The catalyst for the UK’s change of course, it seems, is Trump.
There is significant evidence suggesting that Trump views the EU and some of its member states as adversaries, rather than allies.
While the US will remain the most important ally of the EU and NATO’s European members, it is no longer the most reliable one.
This shift has dashed hopes in the UK that post-Brexit Britain would be able to capitalize on its “special relationship” with the US, and it has highlighted for the EU the urgency of increasing its own strategic autonomy.
While the North Atlantic alliance will remain critical to European security, the EU now seeks to build the capacity to define its own strategic priorities and, if needed, act upon them, whether alone or with partners.
Achieving this objective, defined in the EU’s 2016 “Global Strategy,” will be much easier with the UK on board.
The fact is that the EU and the UK have more international clout together than separately.
The UK has significant diplomatic experience, international influence, and military and economic resources that can be brought to bear on joint ventures, just as the EU’s backing can provide a major boost to UK policies on the world stage.
This applies to démarches regarding major actors like China or Russia, sanctions regimes, international agreements, and strategic programs like Galileo, the European satellite navigation system.
How exactly a post-Brexit UK can be institutionally associated with common EU decisions on foreign policy, security, and defense will have to be determined in the exit agreement.
But it is possible to create a format that gives the UK a voice, not a veto.
In the meantime, no decisions should be taken that would prevent or undermine the UK’s post-Brexit coordination with EU foreign-policy positions, actions, and instruments.
Moreover, steps can and should be taken today to strengthen ties between the EU and the UK.
Here, collaboration among the E3, in particular, is crucial.
The E3 has already proved its potential.
It initiated negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program as early as 2003, and became the nucleus of the E3-plus-3 (China, Russia, and the US), which – along with the European Union – concluded the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran in 2015.
In the wake of Trump’s decision to withdraw the US from the JCPOA, the E3 – together with the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy – will prove integral to saving it, and to developing more wide-ranging solutions for dealing with Iran.
But the E3 has an important role to play in other areas, too, including the conflicts in Syria and Yemen, the ongoing Israel-Palestine dispute, instability in North Africa, and maritime security in the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and the South China Sea.
Depending on the issue, other relevant EU member states – such as Italy, Poland, or Spain – will have to join the E3 in developing policies or negotiating agreements.
E3 initiatives should always be coordinated with the EU’s high representative, in order to take full advantage of the bloc’s legitimacy and resources.
More frequent and visible strategic coordination among the E3 would support the ability of the EU and the UK to reap the benefits of mutual cooperation. It may also serve as a foundation for a pragmatic Brexit agreement that maintains close cooperation between the UK and the EU on foreign and security policy.
Whether the EU likes it or not, a credible joint initiative by France, Germany, and the UK would have a greater impact on the likes of Iran, Russia, China, or even the US than a common EU position emanating from a debate in the EU’s Political and Security Committee.
Fostering deeper E3 collaboration, of the kind that has been seen recently, must remain at the top of the EU’s foreign-policy agenda before and after Brexit.
The fact that France, Germany, and the UK will all be members of the UN Security Council for the 2019-2020 period – France and the UK as permanent members, and Germany as an elected member – will add heft to cooperative action among them.
Moreover, close collaboration within the Security Council could help to structure EU-UK foreign-policy coordination in the immediate post-Brexit transition period.
A Progressive Political Alliance for Europe
WASHINGTON, DC – In less than three weeks, we will know who will be the next president of the United States.
What kind of partner that president finds in Europe will depend substantially on the outcome of two elections in 2017: France’s presidential election in early May and Germany’s federal election by the end of October.
Of course, the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union will have an impact on the future shape of Europe.
The “hard Brexit” option that has gotten a lot of attention lately – particularly since British Prime Minister Theresa May announced her intention to focus on limiting immigration, even if it means losing access to the single market – would by itself change the way Europe functions.
As French Prime Minister Manuel Valls recently wrote, the key question facing Europe’s leaders is whether to “give up and leave the European project to a slow but certain death” or to “transform the EU.”
Such a transformation would be no easy feat.
It would require not only a new institutional vision for Europe, but also a major political restructuring, not least in France and Germany.
A viable institutional vision, which I described well before the Brexit vote, is to establish “two Europes in one.”
The eurozone countries would form a more deeply integrated “Europe A,” while another group of countries would comprise a more diverse and loosely connected “Europe B.”
The two Europes would be strongly linked, with some arrangements differing among the various members of Europe B. Together, the two Europes would be part of the post-Brexit “continental partnership,” which might eventually even replace the EU altogether.
It is a somewhat radical vision, one that can be fulfilled only if political forces are willing to embrace it, not least in France and Germany.
Each country’s political leadership would need to be guided – indeed, energized – by the objective of saving “Europe.”
Specifically, that means pursuing an economic policy that balances competitive markets and social solidarity, with substantial space for local diversity.
In both France and Germany, such a political dynamic would depend on an alliance of center-right and center-left pro-Europe forces – one that could overcome and ultimately dissipate each camp’s more extremist elements, thereby ensuring that anti-European political tendencies cannot block progress.
To give a concrete – and provocative – example of what such a realignment might look like in France: a center-right President Alain Juppé could cooperate with a Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron trying to develop a “beyond the past” young center-left movement.
As for Germany, the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is, on the whole, insufficiently pro-European.
Internally, it is limited by a conservative wing defined by views that are not compatible with long-term progress in Europe. Externally, it is limited by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has lately grown in popularity.
In this context, even if Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU does emerge with the most votes next year, it will need help to build a new Europe, with more joint responsibilities for countries in Europe A and flexible arrangements with countries in Europe B. Specifically, the pro-European elements of the CDU must work with allies on the left – namely, most of the Social Democrats and the Greens.
Such an informal coalition has often allowed pro-Merkel projects to win support in Parliament, despite opposition from right-wing elements of the CDU.
But, to save Europe, it must become deeper and more reliable, with common goals dominating a shared agenda.
The need for a realignment of political forces is not unique to France and Germany.
There is a broad need for reformist and realistic globalizers to join forces to take on populist movements seeking to twist nostalgia into extreme nationalism, built almost exclusively on identity politics.
The world has changed substantially in recent decades, and Europe is no exception.
It makes little sense to expect the old alignments to be able to respond adequately to today’s policy needs or political dynamics.
Consider how difficult it has been for Spain to find a new majority – a two-year-long process that has yet to end.
Against this background, a political reshuffling is almost inevitable; the party shifts and conflicts that have characterized the ongoing US presidential election exemplify this.
But that reshuffling could lead to a number of outcomes.
To secure a positive, open, and prosperous future for Europe, it is critical that the forces that come out on top are those that recognize the huge benefits of politically and economically open societies, as well as the need for national and global public policies to promote more inclusion.
But even if progressive center-right and center-left forces manage to overcome their backward-looking counterparts, it will not be enough.
The traditional political structure always risks being taken hostage or outflanked by identity-focused populists.
That is why forward-thinking political groups must overcome their differences in a more structural manner to advance a new institutional vision of Europe.
Such a deep political restructuring aimed at building new progressive majorities will be difficult, and it will not happen overnight.
But it is Europe’s only option.
Without it, “Europe” will die, and the assault on economic openness and democratic values will continue to gain traction around the world – with potentially devastating consequences.
A European Plan for France and Germany
PARIS – Europe is falling into a stagnation trap.
With growth barely visible, and dangerously low inflation causing real interest rates to rise, the weight of public and private debt has grown very heavy, and many fear that another lost decade is at hand.
And, though the threat of eurozone fragmentation has receded, it has not disappeared.
Given all of this, Europe is losing relevance internally and externally.
France and Germany – which largely drove European integration for more than six decades – must not resign themselves to this state of affairs.
They urgently need a common plan, not mutual recrimination by German supply-siders and French demand-siders.
We find such controversies pointless.
Lackluster productivity growth is prima facie evidence of a supply deficiency.
The combination of high unemployment and falling inflation is prima facie evidence of a demand shortfall.
Interest-rate differentials within the same currency area are prima facie evidence of fragmentation.
The truth is that Europe suffers from multiple ills.
So action is needed on all three fronts.
The question is how to carry it out.
If Europe were a single country with a single government, it would adopt a two-handed strategy, combining ambitious pro-growth reforms with fiscal-policy support.
The central bank would make it clear that it stands ready – provided that the reforms are real and the commitment to subsequent fiscal consolidation is credible – to serve as a “backstop for government funding” (as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi put it in August).
Europe can do none of this, and no easy solutions are available.
Some say that Germany should stimulate demand while other countries, including France, implement supply-side reforms.
But an increase in debt in one country beyond what is desirable from a national perspective cannot be traded for the benefits of pro-growth reform in other countries.
One solution would be to establish a fiscal capacity at the eurozone level, or, in plain words, a eurozone budget, including the ability to borrow.
But, though that is certainly desirable in the long term, currently there are no revenue flows into such a budget, and there is no governance structure to execute it.
In this context, investment has emerged as everybody’s favorite response.
The European Commission has proposed a plan to stimulate investment spending through a new financing scheme, one that we hope will succeed.
But solving Europe’s growth problem requires more than just throwing money at it.
In a recent report to the French and German economy ministers, we propose a pragmatic agenda that accounts for the fact that, while both France and Germany need reforms, they face different challenges and must focus their policies accordingly.
In France, short-term uncertainties are reducing confidence, but the longer-term outlook looks promising.
In Germany, longer-term uncertainties are reducing confidence, but short-term prospects look good.
In France, we fear a lack of boldness; in Germany, we fear complacency.
French policymakers should give priority to a new growth model, based on greater flexibility and security for employees, and a leaner, more effective state.
Germany, meanwhile, must address its demographic challenges, in particular by preparing German society for increased immigration, and promote the transition to an inclusive growth model based on improved demand and a better balance of saving and investment.
We also call for a clearer regulatory environment.
Private investment is a judgment about the future.
In energy, transport, and the digital sector, to name just a few, regulators must set the right parameters and ensure predictability.
Investors need to know with certainty that Europe is committed to accelerating its transition to a low-carbon, knowledge-based economy.
This requires eliminating uncertainty about the future price of carbon and the future regime for data protection.
France and Germany should also promote a “borderless sector” model in a few strategically important industries, which means common legislation, common regulation, and even a common regulator.
We think that energy and the digital economy are such sectors, and we propose a similar initiative to ensure the full portability of skills and social benefits.
Moreover, like the European Commission, we believe that higher investment is a big part of the answer to Europe’s growth question.
Germany’s public-finance framework rightly attributes constitutional status to keeping debt under control, but it neglects investment promotion within the remaining fiscal space.
Leaving a worn-out house to future generations to repair is not a responsible way to manage wealth.
The German government can and should increase public investment.
At the same time, while authorities are asking banks to assume less risk, they also must prevent pervasive risk aversion in the financial system.
We propose injecting new European public money into the development of risk-sharing instruments and vehicles that support equity investment.
We also propose creating a European grant fund to support public investment in the eurozone that advances common aims, strengthens solidarity, and promotes excellence.
Europe is more than a market, a currency, or a budget.
It was built around a set of shared values.
To uphold those values, France and Germany must join forces to rediscover and reinvent Europe’s social model, starting with concrete initiatives in the fields of minimum-wage standards, labor-market policies, retirement, and education.
For decades, the Franco-German alliance bound Europe together and drove it forward.
Today, French and German officials issue joint declarations and exchange accusations.
But the time for bickering is over.
Europe needs action.
France Goes to Hollande
PARIS – France has now conducted its ninth presidential election under direct universal suffrage.
And, for the first time in 17 years, after three consecutive defeats, the left – embodied in the Socialist candidate, François Hollande – will return to Élysée Palace.
Indeed, the first implication of this unquestionably significant election is that it confirms a return to stability.
France is the largest country in Europe to have so much trouble finding its balance.
Its revolution in 1789 initiated a long period of profound instability, featuring two empires, three monarchies, and five republics.
The French have gone through 13 constitutions in less than 200 years.
At 54 years old, the current Fifth Republic is the second longest-lasting regime since the revolution.
At times, there has been talk of a Sixth Republic, which would address limited but real concerns and difficulties.
But voter turnout in the latest presidential election (80% in the first round, and 81% in the second round) leaves no doubt: our current system is strong, and we French are attached to it.
But the primary importance of the election result is the left’s return to power for only the second time in 31 years. In fact, when François Mitterand was elected in 1981, the left had been out of power since 1957.
Back then, the Communist Party was still powerful, and maintained close ties with the Soviet Union.
The prospect that the Party could come to power in an electoral alliance with the Socialists struck fear in opponents.
The Socialists, for their part, had not yet shed their intellectual skin.
Mitterand’s political program was a hymn to economic planning, and the free market was still, for him, synonymous with oppression.
Today, there is no longer international communism, or, for that matter, French communism.
We remember having seen the left govern without drama.
Its two passages to power – ten years under Mitterand and five years with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin – forced the left to reconcile with reality.
France’s international reputation was not damaged, and, at home, the left’s performance, especially concerning unemployment, compared well with that of other governments.
So, there will be no panic this time.
On the contrary, the left’s return to power appears to be an entirely normal, almost trivial, example of alternation in government.
In fact, Hollande’s victory was underpinned not by a leftward shift among the electorate, but by voters’ rejection of Nicolas Sarkozy.
Indeed, the result represents a stunning and historic defeat: during the Fifth Republic, three sitting presidents – Charles de Gaulle, Mitterrand, and Jacques Chirac – have been reelected after their first term in office.
Only Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, weakened by the long decline of Gaullism, was not.
The rejection of Sarkozy is very different; above all, it is a matter of style.
There remains a type of royalism among the French, and our constitution has many features of an elective monarchy.
With his over-familiarity, simplicity, and occasional vulgarity, Sarkozy undermined the dignity of his sacred function.
This was not forgiven, and was judged more severely than the shortcomings of his presidential record, which was not significantly worse than that of his predecessors.
Moreover, in substantive terms, Sarkozy’s tax policies, in particular, favored the upper classes and the wealthy.
So a powerful combination of social and economic anger emerged, particularly given the perception that the excessive greed of financiers and bankers was the primary cause of the crisis that erupted in 2008, and that still menaces us today.
A social and political correction was necessary, and it has occurred with a vengeance unique to France.
But the state’s coffers are dangerously depleted, and France now finds itself among the many countries whose debt burden compromises the eurozone’s existence.
Thus, it is now subject to the discourse of economic orthodoxy, which, in insisting that all debts be paid to the penny, ignores that public spending is also an engine of growth.
Just how much will actually have to be repaid?
With Germany as the primary exponent of orthodoxy, the debate has raged on.
But now we see that austerity has plunged Greece, Portugal, and especially Spain and Italy deeply into recession.
The president of the European Central Bank, as well as the International Monetary Fund, acknowledge the gravity of the problem.
But what happens if we refuse to accept Germany’s position?
The victory of Hollande, who has said that he wants to “renegotiate” the European Union’s new, German-backed “fiscal compact,” will weigh heavily in this debate.
Furthermore, the Socialists now control not only the presidency and the government, but also a majority in the Senate, all of the regional presidencies, 55% of the country’s departments, and most major cities’ town halls.
In less than two months, they may control a majority of the National Assembly as well, implying a concentration of power that has never before been seen in modern France.
The Socialists can govern without limits, so it is up to them to govern well.
It is this uncertainty that hovers over the future of France, if not that of Europe.
France in Search of Europe
With its ten new members, the European Union comprises 25 countries and 453 million citizens.
In light of the fact that during the past millennium the EU’s members fought countless wars with each other, and that for forty five years a cold war split the continent into two hostile blocs, today’s Europe is a success of monumental historical significance.
Indeed, the EU represents many things simultaneously.
First, it is a guarantee of peace: war is now technically impossible between the Union’s interlinked member countries.
Moreover, the EU is a majestic instrument for international reconciliation.
The Germans and the French, who 60 years ago loved each other about as much as Serbs and Bosnians do today, are now a married couple.
Catholics and Protestants in Ireland were killing each other for a century, but now that they are in the EU, they have recognized the idiocy of their conflict and the inevitability of reconciliation.
Hungarians and Romanians, after nine centuries of hatred and wars, are embarking on the same process.
Greece has just decided to support the opening of negotiations for Turkey’s entry into the EU in the next twelve years.
The Union has also been a bearer of prosperity, because it is an effective mechanism for lagging members to surmount long-standing barriers to development.
Ireland and Greece, once the two poorest countries of Europe have surged economically, with Greece coming close to the European average and Ireland having already taken its place among the richest.
It is for these reasons that countries outside the EU want to join.
In less than two years, this will become a reality for Bulgaria and Romania, while negotiations are beginning with Croatia and Turkey. There is also talk about membership for Serbia and Ukraine.
For each of these countries, membership will mean a stable peace with its neighbors and reconciliation at home, as well as accelerated economic growth.
All of this entails a certain amount of instability, particularly if expansion is driven by negotiations among governments, rather than by democratic choices.
The project of the new European Constitution was devised to remedy this problem.
And, lo and behold, France, which is scheduled to ratify the Constitution by a referendum on May 29, gives the impression of wanting to vote against it.
If it does, the result will be an earthquake.
Although every member nation has played its part in integrating Europe, France has without doubt been the country that provided most of the ideas and master builders.
So what is going on?
In France, as elsewhere in Europe, there have always existed unbridled nationalists, the “sovereignists” who say no to Europe in the name of defending the nation.
But whether they belong to the extreme right or the communist left, they represent barely 20% of the electorate.
Over and above that, two factors explain the bizarre phenomenon captured by recent opinion polls in France.
The first is that the French have accounts to settle with their president and the government.
Jacques Chirac was re-elected president with 82% of the vote because of the menace from the extreme right.
According to all evidence, half of his votes came from the left.
But Chirac acted as if his mandate had been unequivocal and put in place one of the most conservative governments France has seen for half a century.
“Let’s make the poor pay” is his fiscal order of the day.
It smacks of usurpation and is inciting many of the French to vote their anger.
The other factor is that France, like the rest of the world, suffers from an ill-managed form of globalization.
As a result, France suffers from growing inequality, high and still-rising unemployment, constant corporate restructurings entailing layoffs, threats to public services and social welfare programs, and a general feeling of insecurity.
The world has undergone massive economic deregulation, prescribed by the monetarist doctrine supported by the conservative forces dominant in the developed countries of North America, Europe, and the Far East.
This economic tsunami has come to us from the United States – there is nothing in it for Europe, but the right-wing forces in all our countries, which have coalesced into the majority that governs Europe, have rallied to its support.
It is the desire to reject this state of affairs that, above all else, explains the “No” many French people want to shout.
But to do so would be a big mistake.
Only Europe as a whole, focused politically on the idea of better regulation, is big enough to block the neo-liberal tsunami.
But it needs great doctrinal clarity, a firm political will, and a constitution.
Indeed, rejection of the EU Constitution is a sure way to kill European dynamism and weaken Europe’s ability to defend itself.
The debate in France is still raging, and nothing is yet lost.
The French people still have time to pull themselves together – and opinion polls suggest that they are beginning to do it.
Europe deserves it.
France is Not Working
France’s chronic malaise is marked by periodic explosions of protest.
The two most recent episodes – the rioting and arson in French cities last autumn and the successful student campaign earlier this year against a new law governing young labor-market entrants – seem to have little in common.
But their unifying thread is youth, unemployment, and uncertainty about the future, as well as the suffocating state paternalism that underlies the wider malaise itself.
Take, for example, the desirable goal of job security.
French governments have sought it in the only way they know – by ever more regulation.
Unsurprisingly, rules that make it difficult to fire established workers discourage employers from hiring new ones.
Insiders enjoy lavish protections, while entry barriers to the millions left outside are insurmountable.
As a result, unemployment is averaging 10% this decade and has not been below 8% for 20 years.
And, while the overall level of unemployment has remained stable – albeit at a shockingly high level – the unemployment rate among young men (in the 16-24 age group) jumped from 15.3% in 1990 to 21.4% in 2005.
France’s benevolent paternalism penalizes the young beyond the labor market as well.
On paper, wealth redistribution through high taxes and state transfers, reflecting Republican ideals of equality and social cohesion ( fraternité ), has brought good results.
Unlike most other OECD countries, where inequalities have increased over the last 30 years, in France pre-tax income inequality decreased slightly, or at worst remained stable, from 1970 to 2000.
But this aggregate stability masks shifts in income distribution that have favored older age cohorts.
Those around retirement age (51-65) saw their share in total income rise by three percentage points in the last ten years, while younger groups, particularly those aged 18-25, lost ground, with their income share falling by five percentage points.
By 1995, relative poverty was increasing sharply for young adults, while the opposite trend occurred among the elderly.
In 1970, a quarter of all pensioners lived in poverty; today, the figure is only 4%.
Joblessness is the main cause of poverty, and the best protection against it is earned income, for which even France’s generous welfare payments are an inadequate substitute.
Moreover, the high payroll taxes needed to finance these benefits constitute another deterrent to hiring, as does the high minimum wage, which tends to price unskilled labor above its potential productivity.
The relatively generous dole and the prospect of high taxes once in work merely reduces the incentive to take low-paid jobs.
As a result, 40% of all transfers go to poor but able-bodied people of working age.
The full extent of the French system’s pathology becomes fully clear in the light of successive governments’ attempts at reform, with piecemeal measures the norm – and thus proving counter-productive on balance, or failing altogether.
Minimum-wage increases, for example, counteract income-tax credits and lower payroll taxes aimed at encouraging youth employment.
The unspoken premise is that there must be no losers, not even in the short term.
The logical answer would be to reduce equally the degree of job security enjoyed by the entire labor force.
But no French government in recent decades has been remotely strong enough to face down opposition – often involving illegal action that goes unpunished – to any reduction in entrenched privileges.
Perhaps the only way out of France’s current impasse is the no-less traditional French route of revolution.
According to this view, the system is unreformable, and real change will be possible only after it finally collapses, perhaps owing to fiscal weakness, since the combination of deficit-financed transfers, low growth, and low labor-market participation may prove unsustainable.
After all, whatever the deeper causes of the French Revolution of 1789, the immediate trigger was a public-finance crisis.
The social strains of high unemployment – especially among young people – may force decisive change even before any fiscal meltdown.
But evolutionary progress is always preferable to revolutionary upheaval, and, despite all the difficulties of genuine incremental reform, the prospects are not absolutely hopeless.
This is clear from the remarkable recent experience of “Sciences Po,” one of the elite grandes écoles in the center of Paris.
An ostensibly meritocratic competitive admission system to the grandes écoles is in fact monopolized by the socially privileged, who accounted for 81% of students admitted to Sciences Po in 1998 (compared to the roughly 60% of students at Oxford and Cambridge who come from fee-paying private schools).
The head of Sciences Po, Richard Descoings, implemented a program of positive discrimination that favors disadvantaged candidates, such as those from immigrant suburbs and rural areas, and charges increased fees to wealthier students.
Descoings faced strong – and often cogent ­– opposition.
But the dynamic of all reform is clinched when even weighty arguments succumb to the urgency of change.
For France as a whole, the long-term cost of withholding tough medicine will ultimately be much higher than the short-term pain of reforming the country’s fiscally unsustainable and spiritually impoverishing welfare state.
Young people in France will rediscover trust and hope when they can be shown a world where fairness consists not just in egalitarian and unconditional redistribution, but also in hard work and good behavior.
Change for the better will be founded on the basic conviction that one should get what one deserves and deserve what one gets.
France à la Sarkozy
Eight months into his presidency, is Nicolas Sarkozy delivering the “rupture” from 30 years of French immobility that he promised?
Dubbed the “hyper-president” by bewildered media, he has launched a vast number of reforms, many of which were once considered political suicide.
He has targeted many areas – including universities, the judiciary, foreign policy, immigration, taxation, and the environment – but it is the economy that will prove to be the make-or-break issue.
Sarkozy’s slogan “work more to earn more” has won him considerable support.
The crucial test will be his ability to reform the labor market, whose rigidities are widely seen as the main cause of France’s relatively poor economic performance, with an unemployment rate that has never dipped below 8% over the last 25 years.
While the government has begun many projects, with few exceptions, including tax breaks for the wealthy, most are still in the making.
The most important concern public employment, pensions, labor legislation, and the length of the workweek, all of which generate fierce resistance.
The main reason for the slow pace – noting that previous presidents had no pace at all – is a 2005 law that requires that all measures affecting the labor market first be negotiated in good faith with the trade unions.
Naturally, the unions impede negotiations as much as possible.
As a result, France is likely soon to surpass Sweden as the world’s highest public spender.
All French finance ministers lament that they had very little room for cutting costs, given the scope of entitlements, particularly civil servants’ salaries and pensions.
With half of all current civil servants set to retire over the next ten years, Sarkozy has pledged to replace only one of every two.
In 2007, the attrition rate was one out of three – short of the pledge, but a sharp reversal from previous decades, in which the ranks of civil servants grew significantly faster than private-sector employment.
Sarkozy believes that he has a popular mandate to push his labor-market reforms through parliament, where he controls a large majority.
By contrast, the unions argue that they have “social legitimacy,” a claim that may surprise many outside France, but that holds considerable sway in a country where large-scale demonstrations or drawn-out strikes are interpreted as a valid representation of popular will.
From the outset, both sides expected a defining fight, which occurred last November, after the government decided to align the retirement age in the public sector with that of the private sector.
When President Jacques Chirac’s first government attempted such a reform in 1995, railroad workers, who can retire at age 50 or 55, spearheaded the resistance.
After nearly three weeks of complete stoppage of trains, the government caved in, and soon thereafter lost a general election.
The 1995 strike became an icon of “social legitimacy,” instilling fear in all succeeding governments.
But this time around, the unions caved in after nine days, largely because the reform had been explained and promised to the public during the presidential campaign.
Democratic legitimacy won a major battle over social legitimacy.
This opens the way to more and deeper reforms.
A law restricting transport strikes took effect on January 1, and Sarkozy intends to break the 35-hour workweek, albeit indirectly.
Instead of repealing the law, overtime work is to become easy and relatively cheap.
He is also preparing to raise the retirement age to 61, from 60.
Even more provocative are the next steps: a plan to revamp the standard work contract and to require that all workers be invited to vote after eight days of a strike.
Indeed, probably the most fundamental measure is to transform radically the way trade unions operate.
Their role is currently codified by a post-1945 law that gives them enormous influence, even though their membership has dwindled to a mere 8% of employees.
The plan, yet to be fully articulated, is to make them accountable to all workers, not just to their membership – another way of promoting democratic legitimacy, but this time at the heart of the social system.
One reason why Sarkozy could succeed where previous governments have never dreamt to venture, aside from his popular mandate for reform, is a “win-win” strategy, whereby victory for reform implies substantial compensation.
For example, Sarkozy has promised that half of the savings from the reduction in public employment will go to higher pay – possibly based on merit, another red line for the trade unions.
But Sarkozy is not quite turning France, long a country hostile to supply-side reform, into what many would consider a normal economy.
While he has the right instincts concerning labor markets, he is very French on other issues.
He is a staunch advocate of industrial policies, which will lead him into sharp confrontation with the European Commission and many of his colleagues.
He also harbors a deep distrust of financial markets and often advocates more regulation, and sees the strong euro as a threat to French industry and the result of speculation, which has already provoked serious clashes with the European Central Bank.
On all these issues, much of the decision-making power has been transferred to the European Union, which dramatically reduces Sarkozy’s room for maneuver.
But France will hold the EU’s rotating presidency in the second half of 2008.
Nobody’s perfect, least of all Sarkozy, so we should expect some infuriating initiatives.
The Coming French Revolution
PARIS – In a few weeks, France will elect its next president.
Given the French executive’s considerable powers, including the authority to dissolve the National Assembly, the presidential election, held every five years, is France’s most important.
But the stakes are higher than ever this time.
The two frontrunners are the far-right National Front’s Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron, who served as economy minister under Socialist President François Hollande, but is running as an independent.
If, as expected, Le Pen and Macron face off in the election’s second round on May 7, it will be a political watershed for France: the first time in 60 years that the main parties of the left and the right are not represented in the second round.
France has not endured such political turmoil since 1958, when, in the midst of the Algerian War, General Charles de Gaulle came to power and crafted the Constitution of the Fifth Republic.
That shift, like any great political rupture, was driven by a combination of deep underlying dynamics and the particular circumstances of the moment.
Today is no different.
First, the underlying dynamic: the rise, as in most developed countries nowadays, of popular mistrust of elites, feelings of disempowerment, fear of economic globalization and immigration, and anxiety over downward social mobility and growing inequality.
These sentiments – together with the French state’s historical role in fostering national identity and economic growth – have contributed to a surge in support for the National Front.
Le Pen’s nationalist, xenophobic message and populist economic policies resemble those of the far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon.
Although support for the National Front has been growing for more than a decade, the party has so far been kept out of power by France’s two-round electoral system, which enables voters to unite against it in the second round.
And, given the National Front’s inability to make alliances, power has remained in the hands of the main parties of the left and the right, even as France has moved toward a tripartite political system.
Now, Macron is taking advantage of current circumstances to blow up the tripartite system.
Macron’s great insight, which few initially recognized, was that the right-left divide was blocking progress, and that the presidential election amounted to a golden opportunity to move beyond it, without the help of an organized political movement.
At a time when the French people are increasingly rejecting the traditional party system, Macron’s initial weakness quickly became his strength.
It helped that, as Macron himself recognized, both the right and the left have fragmented in recent years.
This is particularly true on the left, where a clear division has emerged between a reformist current, led by former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, and traditionalists, represented by the Socialist Party candidate, Benoît Hamon.
The Socialists’ problems are compounded by the existence of a radical left working actively to eliminate them, much as Spain’s left-wing Podemos party has sought to replace the Socialist Workers’ Party there.
The source of the mainstream right’s travails is less clear.
Its forces remain generally united on economic and social issues.
In fact, until a few months ago, its presidential candidate, the Republicans’ François Fillon, was expected to lead the pack in the first round by a wide margin.
But a scandal over his personal conduct (he allegedly paid his wife and children for non-existent jobs while he was a member of parliament) damaged his candidacy – probably fatally.
Whatever the reason for the right’s decline, Macron has benefited substantially from it, as well as from the rifts afflicting the left.
Now, there is a real chance the young independent could be elected president on May 7, upending the Fifth Republic’s political system.
But an electoral victory is just a first step.
To govern in France’s hybrid presidential-parliamentary system, Macron would need to secure a majority in the National Assembly.
This opens the possibility of two scenarios.
In the first scenario, Macron quickly gains a parliamentary majority, as French voters seek to reinforce his mandate in June’s National Assembly election.
This is conceivable, but not certain: it is here where the lack of an organized political movement on the ground remains a weakness for Macron.
That is why the June election could give rise to the second scenario: cohabitation with a parliamentary coalition comprising a small right-wing faction, a large centrist faction, and a hopelessly divided left-wing faction.
Such a development would be familiar in many European countries.
But in France, where republicanism gave rise to the left-right ideological spectrum that shapes politics throughout the West today, it would be a genuine revolution – one that could spell the end of the Socialist Party.
Given the symbolic power of the left-right divide, France’s voters and political leaders alike have long tended to frame virtually all of the country’s problems in ideological terms.
The public and its politicians have little experience with government based on broad coalition agreements.
This partly explains why the political system becomes gridlocked, sometimes making reforms difficult to implement, and why Macron’s message, which includes clear reform plans, is so unusual for France.
If Le Pen somehow comes out on top, French politics – not to mention the European Union – will be turned upside.
But even the ostensibly moderate Macron represents, in his own way, a truly radical stance.
With both candidates likely to make it to the second round, France is on the verge of a political revolution, regardless of who wins.
France’s Model of Resilience to Terror
PARIS – In a recent tweetstorm, US President Donald Trump shared anti-Muslim smears from the extreme-right hate group Britain First, thus reminding us of the deep divisions and fears that terrorism has injected into Western democracies.
But not everyone responds to terrorist attacks with the atavism of Trump or Britain First.
Take France, where on November 13, 2015, Islamic State (ISIS) militants carried out terror attacks on the Bataclan concert hall and other sites in Paris.
Although 130 people were murdered – more than in any other episode of violence against civilians in France since World War II – France’s commemoration of the second anniversary was extremely subdued.
French authorities, it seems, wanted to avoid reawakening the painful trauma of the event.
That trauma is a very real fact of life for the families who lost a loved one, and are permanently devastated, and for the survivors, whose experience has received little attention.
Much of the news coverage accompanying this anniversary showed that for most victims, even those who were not physically harmed, relearning “the next life” is an everyday ordeal.
Since the attacks, their relationship with their surroundings has been upset.
Sleep disorders, hallucinations, and depressive syndromes are common.
Entire lives have been transformed.
In a November survey published in Le Monde, many victims reported an inability to return to work.
And with each new attack, in France or elsewhere, the trauma is reawakened.
“Life goes on,” writes one survivor. “But what life?”
On the other hand, French society has proved resilient.
After the Paris attacks, the French quickly showed that they would not give up their way of life, nor would they give in to the temptation of civil war.
There have been no significant outbursts against the country’s Muslim population.
The state of emergency that former President François Hollande declared immediately after the attacks allowed French authorities to ensure public order, by detaining suspects, conducting home searches, and closing certain places of worship.
Human-rights groups criticized some of these measures as violations of civil liberties; but, for the most part, they were applied smoothly.
On November 1, 2017, many of the same state-of-emergency measures, with some adjustments, were codified in law.
Despite some expected protests, the new anti-terrorism legislation enjoys wide support among the French, who seem willing to accept certain limitations to personal freedoms in the name of collective security.
Another consequence of the attacks is that international cooperation among security services has strengthened, new technologies have been adopted, and video surveillance has been implemented more widely.
Earlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron established a specialized counter-terror task force at the Élysée Palace.
And, over time, armed soldiers – some of whom have been targets of new attacks – have become a familiar presence on French streets.
Still, a majority of French citizens remain deeply concerned about the threat of terrorism not just from abroad, but from people living in France, often with French citizenship.
And similar fears about homegrown extremism can be observed in many other European countries.
In recent years, some of those drawn to Islamist-inspired extremism have carried out attacks with rudimentary instruments, from cars and delivery trucks to kitchen knives.
Although violent extremists are an ultra-minority in the Muslim population, their actions have fueled a growing distrust in French society.
Worse still, the successful military campaign against ISIS raises new fears about violent extremists returning from Syria.
Already, more than 250 people, including nearly 60 children, have returned to France.
More often than not, they are picked up by law enforcement and brought to justice.
Yet dealing with returning women and children has become another controversy in itself.
And, in addition to the known militants, law-enforcement agencies must monitor thousands of other suspects.
This state of affairs inevitably affects French attitudes toward receiving migrants and refugees, most of whom come from predominantly Muslim countries.
It also has a profound impact on the unspoken but constant debate in France about the place of Muslims in French society.
While visible expressions of Islam have long been a source of controversy in France – owing to the country’s political and colonial history, conception of national identity, and cultural and legal secularism – similar debates are also playing out in Germany, the Netherlands, and other European countries.
In the two years since the ISIS attacks in Paris, France has readied itself to face the terrorist threat.
But the political consensus about how to tackle terrorism, which prevailed after the January 2015 attacks on Charlie Hebdo and the Hypercacher kosher supermarket, has eroded.
Some now want to dismiss terrorism as a feature of everyday life, as if extremist violence posed a danger similar to traffic accidents, alcohol, or disease.
These arguments will likely fall flat in France.
Even if the threat of terrorism will always exist, resilience must not become resignation.
If there is another serious attack, the French will undoubtedly hold their leaders accountable for failing to protect them.
And if elected officials have failed to take necessary precautions or demonstrated a sense of resignation, voters will let them know at the ballot box.
For proof, look no further than the success of right-wing parties in the last German and Austrian elections.
France’s Broken Dream
CAMBRIDGE – The crisis in the eurozone is the result of France’s persistent pursuit of the “European project,” the goal of political unification that began after World War II when two leading French politicians, Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman, proposed the creation of a United States of Europe.
Monnet and Schuman argued that a political union similar to America’s would prevent the types of conflict that had caused three major European wars – an appealing idea, but one that overlooked America’s horrific Civil War.
A European political union could also make Europe a power comparable to the United States, and thereby give France, with its sophisticated foreign service, an important role in European and world affairs.
The Monnet-Schuman dream led to the 1956 Treaty of Rome, which established a small free-trade area that was later expanded to form the European Economic Community.
Establishing the EEC had favorable economic effects, but, like the North American Free Trade Area, it did not reduce national identification or create a sense of political unity.
That was the purpose of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which established the European Union.
The influential report “One market, one money,” issued in 1990 under the leadership of the former French Finance Minister Jacques Delors, called for the creation of a single currency, relying on the specious argument that the single market could not function well otherwise.
More realistically, advocates of a single currency reasoned that it would cause people to identify as Europeans, and that the shift to a single European Central Bank would herald a shift of power away from national governments.
Germany resisted the euro, arguing that full political union should come first.
Since there was no chance that the other countries would accept political union, Germany’s position seemed like a technical maneuver to prevent the establishment of the single currency.
Germany was reluctant to give up the Deutsche Mark, a symbol of its economic power and commitment to price stability.
Germany eventually agreed to the creation of the euro only when French President François Mitterrand made it a condition of France’s support for German reunification.
Moreover, under pressure from France, the Maastricht Treaty’s requirement that countries could introduce the euro only if their national debt was less than 60% of GDP was relaxed in order to admit countries that were seen to be “evolving” toward that goal.
That modification allowed Greece, Spain, and Italy to be admitted.
The pro-euro politicians ignored economists’ warnings that imposing a single currency on a dozen heterogeneous countries was bound to create serious economic problems.
They regarded the economic risks as unimportant relative to their agenda of political unification.
But the creation of the euro caused a sharp fall in interest rates in the peripheral countries, leading to debt-financed housing bubbles and encouraging their governments to borrow to finance increased government spending.
Amazingly, global financial markets ignored the credit risks of this sovereign debt, requiring only very small differences between interest rates on German bonds and those of Greece and other peripheral countries.
That ended in 2010, after Greece admitted that it had lied about its budget deficits and debt.
Financial markets responded by demanding much higher rates on the bonds of countries with high government debt ratios and banking systems weakened by excessive mortgage debt.
Three small countries (Greece, Ireland, and Portugal) have been forced to accept help from the International Monetary Fund, and to enact painful contractionary fiscal cuts.
The conditions in Greece are now hopeless, and are likely to lead to further defaults and a withdrawal from the eurozone.
Spain, too, is in serious trouble, owing to the budget deficits of its traditionally independent regional governments, the weakness of its banks, and its need to roll over large sovereign-debt balances each year.
It is already clear that the EU’s recently agreed “fiscal compact” will not constrain budget deficits or reduce national debts.
Spain was the first to insist that it could not meet the conditions to which it had just agreed, and other countries will soon follow.
French President François Hollande has proposed balancing deficit limits with growth initiatives, just as France had earlier forced the EU’s Stability Pact to become the Stability and Growth Pact.
The fiscal compact is an empty gesture that may be the last attempt to pretend that EU members are moving toward political unification.
The European project has clearly failed to achieve what French political leaders have wanted from the beginning.
Instead of the amity and sense of purpose of which Monnet and Schuman dreamed, there is conflict and disarray.
Europe’s international role is shrinking, with the old G-5 having evolved into the G-20.
And, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel setting conditions for the eurozone, France’s ambition to dominate European policy has been thwarted.
Even if most eurozone countries retain the single currency, it will be because abandoning the euro would be financially painful.
Now that its weaknesses are clear, the euro will remain a source of trouble rather than a path to political power.
France’s Fourth Moment
KYIV – Since World War II’s end, France has consistently risen to the challenge of restructuring Europe in times of crisis.
In doing so, France became the catalyst not only for building European unity, but also for creating the prosperity that marked Europe’s post-war decades – a prosperity now under threat because of the global financial and economic crisis.
If we are to see a stronger Europe emerge from today’s challenges, visionary French leadership is needed again.
The first moment when decisive French leadership began to unify Europe came when Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer created the European Coal and Steel Community.
By rooting the then West Germany in the political, economic, and social fabric of the West, that step heralded the start of Germany’s rebirth and economic miracle.
The second time that France consolidated Europe’s internal architecture came in 1983, during the debates over the stationing of American cruise and Pershing missiles in Germany to counter the deployment of SS20 missiles by the Soviet Union.
France’s resolve to stand with Germany helped prevent Germany from drifting into a dangerous neutrality that would have shaken the European community to its core.
The third moment came after the Berlin Wall fell, and it was feared that an enlarged Germany might destabilize Europe.
After initially trying to delay reunification, France embraced it, in exchange for Germany’s reaffirming its commitment to European unity and Franco-German leadership of the European community.
As a result, Germany bound itself to the idea of “ever closer union” even more definitively by pledging to join the common European currency, the euro.
It is now urgent that the insights that have animated Franco-German relations be applied to all of Central and Eastern Europe.
Only by securing the European identity of this entire region, and by anchoring the growing Russo-German relationship in a European context, can the European Union continue on its path of stability and prosperity.
Only by reinforcing open trading and financial relations across Europe can we hope to subdue today’s crisis.
For it is in no European country’s interest, or in the interest of the EU as a whole, that Central and Eastern Europe feel that they have been cast adrift or that Germany and Russia fixate on each other in this time of crisis.
As with Germany in the 1950’s, the nature of Russia’s links with its immediate neighbors is turning out to be the defining factor in shaping the country’s international image.
Many observers regard these relations as a signal not just to the region, but to the rest of the world, of the sort of power that Russia wishes to be.
The issue is partly one of “internationalism” itself.
In contrast to Europe – with its close-knit network of multilateral organizations through which states formulate and conduct much of their foreign policies – Russia is not accustomed to intensively cooperative international procedures.
But keeping Russia at arm’s length from Europe has only strengthened the sense of isolation that many Russians feel, tempting them to define the country’s interests in ways that are irreconcilable with those of Europe.
It has also heightened Russia’s desire to construct a special, bilateral Russo-German relationship heedless of the context of the EU.
European history during the past 60 years makes clear that the most promising approach to meeting the challenge of national reconciliation and stability is not to focus on specific contingencies, but to establish procedures that encourage orderly change.
A singular vision has always animated this process: animosity between neighbors must not be allowed to fester, and the rule of law must reign not just within countries, but also between them.
To believe that such a vision can work for Russia, Ukraine, and Europe is not wishful thinking, but rests on the successful experience of France and Germany in promoting amity.
Indeed, the existence or absence of a framework of cooperation often determines whether a dispute mutates into a crisis.
Such cooperative frameworks seek to reconcile national independence with regional interdependence, focusing political leaders’ minds on prosperity for their people rather than on gaining unilateral advantages that ultimately impoverish and unsettle everyone.
The first lesson of European unity is that times of crisis must draw the continent closer together, not divide it through protectionism, competitive devaluations, and expulsions of immigrants.
Similarly, the euro must not be allowed to become an Iron Curtain that consigns non-members to a high-risk zone where investors dare not venture.
For Ukraine, Europe can help by embracing the free-trade agreement that we are now negotiating.
Coupled with our successful membership in the World Trade Organization, Ukraine would stand to benefit when world and European trade begins to recover.
Europe can also consider using various stabilization funds to help our economy through the crisis that we are all enduring.
I do not ask for these things out of a narrow concern for my country’s health.
Just as the US Federal Reserve has engaged in credit and currency swaps with Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, and South Korea and other countries to ease their access to the dollars they need, the European Central Bank must offer such swap arrangements to Europe’s non-euro countries in order for trade and production processes to continue.
Yes, these are dark times, and all politicians want to protect their voters.
But Europe’s greatest postwar leaders understood that keeping the wider view of Europe in mind is the best way to achieve this goal.
As at so many times before, now – with all of our economies in peril – is a moment for decisive French leadership.
France’s Identity Politics
One big surprise of the current presidential campaign in France is how “national identity” has surged to the forefront of the political debate.
During the 1995 presidential campaign, the main issues were unemployment and social divisions.
In 2002, the priority was security.
But the three main candidates this time around – Nicolas Sarkozy, Ségolène Royal, and François Bayrou – have given an entirely different shape to this campaign.
Sarkozy, for example, proposes to establish a ministry of immigration and national identity.
Likewise, while Royal carefully maintains the distinction between nation and nationalism, she is drifting away from the Socialist Party’s old embrace of The Internationale , instead defending La Marseillaise and suggesting that all citizens should display a French flag on the National Day.
Bayrou criticizes the “nationalist obsession” of his competitors, but he supports abrogating the jus soli (the right to obtain French nationality by birth) for people from the French island of Mayotte, owing to massive inflows of pregnant women to the island.
For his part, the far-right leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, says that he is very happy with this evolution.
Indeed, the debate over national identity is nothing new.
The problem is that French identity has always been made up of contradictory and sometimes adversarial elements, such as France’s Catholic and secular traditions, its revolutionary ideology and conservative inclinations, and the cultural outlooks of its rural and working-class citizens.
The historian Ernest Renan, who pondered about national identity after France’s 1871 defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, has defined the nation as a “soul” made up of two parts.
One part, the “rich inheritance of memories,” is rooted in the past, while the other, related to the present and opening the way to the future, consists in the common will of citizens to build their public life together.
Renan gave priority to this will for a common life over any ethnic definition and set the French idea of the nation in direct contrast to the almost racial notion of people (Volk) that dominates the German tradition.
In this view, national identity, is a “spiritual concept” based on a common history and set of values.
Some of these values are rooted in a kind of secular Christianity, and others in the Enlightenment’s revolutionary beliefs about human rights, equality, the French language, secular schooling, and the idea that the state is responsible for the common interest and application of republican principles.
It is this view of national identity – one that transcends race, color, origin and religion – that is now disputed.
The identity crisis now roiling France is fueled by the conjunction of many factors: globalization, which produces uncertainty, the European Union, which curtails the freedom of national leaders, American strategic dominance, which has reduced France’s position in the world, and the rising Asian powers.
This represents a serious challenge to thinkers who sometimes ridicule the idea of the nation itself, arguing that we now inhabit a “post-national” world.
For them, national identity should be abandoned in favor of a European identity, even if the feeling of belonging to Europe is not deeply held among the peoples of the EU.
Instead, the link between identity and immigration, an old refrain of the far right, remains strong, and the issue has grown more heated because of France’s inability to develop an effective policy to integrate immigrants from Africa.
Making matters worse, while religion and culture have traditionally been restricted to the personal sphere in France, some religious demands have intruded into public life, as demonstrated by the disputes over Muslim girls’ wearing of veils in schools.
The problem of the link between national identity and cultural pluralism is now surfacing in nearly the same way in the United Kingdom, Holland, and Denmark – countries that, contrary to France, long ago chose a policy of multiculturalism.
In the United States, a country of huge immigration, communities can bring together a strong cultural identity and a deeply engrained patriotism.
It has been the same in France, which has been built by successive waves of immigrants.
But, contrary to the US, integration in France is not based on assimilation, but on a desire to promote homogeneity – the nation unified as “one and indivisible.”
Today, in a world changed by globalization, France must face the difficult challenge posed by its new immigrants: maintaining the principles at the core of French identity while meeting the desire of some of its new citizens to maintain their own identity, which may in fact oppose some of those principles.
Today’s debate over national identity arises from this tension, so it’s not surprising that it has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
But what is at stake in that debate are values that not only built France, but that also have built and will continue to build Europe.
France’s Judicial Revolution
PARIS – A new and important acronym has entered the French political lexicon: QPC, which stands for the rather austere-sounding “Priority preliminary ruling on the question of constitutionality.”
Under QPC, which was part of the constitutional reforms that France implemented in July 2008, any citizen involved in legal proceedings can now contest the constitutionality of a legislative provision.
This is a far-reaching innovation.
France has long been characterized by Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s philosophy, which placed the law – the expression of the General Will – at the absolute top of the hierarchy of judicial norms.
As a result, a veritable allergy to assessing the constitutionality of any law has long held sway.
Not until Charles de Gaulle’s 1958 Constitution was even a limited assessment of a law by the Conseil Constitutionnel (Constitutional Council) allowed, and then only with extensive precautions.
Indeed, the Constitutional Council made its assessments a priori, one month after adoption of the law, and only four officials could initiate a review: the president, the prime minister, and the presidents of the National Assembly and the Senate.
This list was broadened in 1974 to include any 60 members of the National Assembly or the Senate, thus allowing the opposition to submit the laws adopted through parliamentary majority to some examination of their constitutionality.
But the idea that any citizen could challenge the constitutionality of legislation, as is possible in many European countries and the United States, was inconceivable.
The 2008 constitutional reform finally recognized this possibility.
But a double filter of safeguards was established: the jurisdiction before which the matter is brought, and the competent Supreme Court – either the Council of State [Conseil d’État] or the Final Court of Appeal – which has three months to decide whether to refer a case to the Constitutional Council.
One year after its implementation in March 2010, the reform has shown impressive results.
Of the 400 cases examined by both Supreme Courts, 120 were referred to the Constitutional Council, which has issued 102 rulings, including 22 striking down the challenged legislation.
The reform has allowed the Constitutional Council to reconsider a whole set of laws that had never before been submitted for constitutional review, mainly because they were drafted prior to 1958.
One of the most emblematic decisions concerned the code of criminal procedure, with the Council repealing several articles concerning the legal custody of defendants inside police stations.
Other decisions have dealt with taxation, social legislation, or electoral laws.
But nothing has done as much to cement the QPC’s standing as the recent motion submitted by a lawyer in the ongoing criminal proceedings against former President Jacques Chirac, who is charged with having created fictitious jobs at the Paris City Council when he was mayor.
The Court’s President complied with the lawyer’s motion to adjourn the proceedings until the Constitutional Council ruled on the constitutionality of the laws under which Chirac is charged.
We will find out in the coming weeks whether the Cour de Cassation (Court of Final Appeal) will agree to refer the matter to the Council.
France is thus joining the cohort of countries that, over the past half-century or so, have developed within their legal culture a judicial form of constitutional review of legislation.
Indeed, in June 2009, Germany’s Constitutional Court strengthened its political role by demanding that ratification of the European Union’s Lisbon Treaty be accompanied by a law warranting powers of co-decision to the German Parliament.
More recently, in October 2009, the United Kingdom, despite having no written constitution, replaced its supreme judicial body, which sat in the House of Lords, with a Supreme Court.
The recent legal revolution in France is no less important, even if it is still in a transitional phase.
With the QPC, the entire process of assessing the constitutionality of legislation has gained greater acceptance in French legal practice.
It is no longer the privilege of the political class: testing a law for its constitutionality has become a right of all citizens.
At the same time, after one year of implementation, the Constitutional Council has avoided a drift toward a “government of judges,” instead indicating a genuine desire for dialogue with other institutions, notably policymakers.
For example, when answering a request to deal with marriage and the right of homosexual couples regarding adoption, the Council refused to substitute itself for the legislature, which it considered the only competent body to rule on the matter.
And when the Constitutional Council does censure a law, it leaves Parliament the time it needs to review the decision and bring the law into compliance with the Constitution.
Thus, an equilibrium of sorts between constitutional review and a concern not to cause excessive legal instability has been found.
As the Constitutional Council gets closer to functioning like a Supreme Court, its membership, still heavily influenced by politics, will need to be reassessed.
But a huge step has now been taken towards anchoring all laws in the Constitution, which will strengthen the protection of all citizens’ rights.
France’s Path Not Taken
The new president of France, be it Nicolas Sarkozy or Ségolène Royal, will face a tough challenge when it comes to putting the French economy back on its feet.
While the world economy is booming for the fourth consecutive year, with a historically unprecedented growth rate of about 5%, the French economy is limping.
In 2006, it grew by only 2.2%, while growth rates of only 2.1% and 1.9% can be expected for 2007 and 2008, respectively, according to a recent forecast by the German Economic Research Institutes.
This is significantly below the average of the old EU countries for these three years – 2.7%, 2.6%, and 2.4%, respectively.
France is currently one of Europe’s laggards, only slightly ahead of Italy and Portugal.
Even Germany is performing better.
With a growth rate of 2.7%, the German economy clawed its way back to the average of the old EU countries in 2006, and it can be expected to grow at 2.4% in 2007 and 2008, far faster than France.
France’s meager growth is surprising.
Until recently, the economy was doing fairly well, outperforming many EU countries.
While Germany grew by only 14% in the ten years from 1995 to 2005, ranking as Europe’s “vice-laggard” next to Italy, France grew by 23.6%, which was nearly the old EU countries’ average of 24.3%.
In 2001, France’s gross national income per capita overtook that of Germany, and is now 4% higher.
And yet recent growth figures seem to have reversed this trend for the time being.
French employment data has been worrisome for even longer.
In 2006, France’s unemployment rate was 9.4%, a full percentage point higher than Germany’s.
By 2008, the French rate can be expected to decline only to 8.2%, while German unemployment is anticipated to fall to 6.3%.
A similar pattern holds for public debt.
While Germany has resolved its debt problem insofar as it no longer violates the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact and can be expected to have a balanced budget in 2008, the forecasts for France imply deficits of 2.6% and 2.3% of GDP for this year and 2008.
If the boom in the world economy falters, France will again violate the Stability and Growth Pact, as it did in 2002, 2003, and 2004.
Why are France and Germany behaving so differently during this global boom?
Among the potential explanations, the dissimilar specializations of each country stand out.
While France has specialized in consumer goods such as food and pharmaceutical products, Germany is a leading exporter of investment goods.
As the current boom in the world economy is largely fueled by investment demand rather consumption demand, only Germany profits from it to full measure.
Germany is the tool-shop of the world, with 450 world market leaders in niche products and another 500 companies in the top-three category.
Fifteen of the world’s 20 biggest trade fairs (measured by indoor exhibition space) are held in Germany, and the country tops the list in world commodity exports.
Small wonder, then, that Germany’s economy rockets when the world’s demand for capital goods soars.
True, Germany has its share of problems.
The country is gradually turning into an industrial bazaar that is relocating its workbench to low-wage ex-communist countries.
This is one of the reasons why the boom of 2006 was incapable of creating additional jobs in German manufacturing; why Germany still has the OECD’s highest unemployment among low-skilled workers; and why aggregate full-time employment has not yet returned to its level in 2000.
The French economy could be slightly more stable in the medium term insofar as it seems to have more solid internal sectors.
But Germany definitely is partaking more of the current boom than France does.
Perhaps one French mistake was to neglect its small and medium-size firms and specialize too much on state-controlled mega-companies.
Airbus, Renault, Crédit Lyonnais, and Alstom are well-known examples of a mistaken industrial policy that has wasted French taxpayers’ money – and that is partly connected with the name Sarkozy.
The true problem for France is the huge chunk of state-owned companies that go through the motions without being particularly successful in the market.
In France, 25% of dependent employees work in the government sector, compared with 19% in the old EU and 12% in Germany.
The French government share in GDP is 54%, while Germany’s is only 47%.
In France, more than 7% of voters cast their ballots for Trotskyite and Communist candidates in the first round of the presidential election, while the Socialists, who received 27% of the votes, are much more left-leaning than Germany’s Social Democrats.
Dirigiste attitudes are more popular in France than in most other European countries.
To the extent that these attitudes may have led to a political system in which small and medium-size firms find it difficult to flourish, they may have contributed to France’s problems.
It remains to be seen whether the new French president will be able to embark on a more promising course.
The odds are not good.
Royal will do nothing to increase the flexibility of the French labor market so as to facilitate structural change and enable new firms to be created, while Sarkozy is likely to continue to support France’s lumbering giants, as he as done so frequently in the past.
Sound policy aimed at reviving the economy seems beyond the grasp of both candidates.
France’s Presidential Reality Show
The Socialists’ anointment of Ségolène Royal’s as their presidential candidate is an important step on the road to the Fifth Republic’s eighth presidential election, which is set for April 22, 2007, with a second-round runoff two weeks later.
All candidates should be known by the end of January – the deadline for printing the ballots.
So, by that point, France’s four main political parties, two on the left and two on the right, must prepare their party manifestoes and choose candidates.
That, at least, is how the system is supposed to work in theory.
In practice, while the official campaign is supposed to last only two months (long enough in a democracy, in which candidates have to endure an unrelenting media barrage), the jockeying of potential candidates, together with the media’s appetite for a horse race, helped kick off the real campaign nearly a year and a half ago.
So today’s public debates have a somewhat surreal character, because the programs on which the candidates will stake their campaigns are still not developed.
In their absence, personality and style, not political programs, have proven decisive.
I am not sure this is good for democracy, but that’s the way it is.
Two such stylish personalities have so far commandeered the public opinion polls, and appear destined to meet in the second round.
On the right is Nicolas Sarkozy, the interior minister (and briefly the economy minister), whose political rise took place within the grab-bag framework of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP).
The UMP is the political heir of Gaullism, but its ideological inconsistency is legendary – and reflected in party name changes every eight to ten years.
Sarkozy is philosophically a conservative, but an ultra-liberal on economic issues, making him totally foreign to the Gaullist tradition.
Preaching privatization and social repression, he has placed himself to the right of the right, hoping to take back the votes that the mainstream right has been losing to Jean-Marie Le Pen’s “fascistoid” National Front for the past 20 years.
Sarkozy imposed himself on the Gaullist movement against the will of President Jacques Chirac; indeed, he snatched the presidency of the UMP despite Chirac’s active opposition.
Much of the public likes his raw language and harsh criticism of the rest of the right, notably of Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, but above all of Chirac.
He knows nothing about international affairs, but no one seems to hold it against him.
On the left, Royal, the Socialist president of the region of Poitou-Charentes, has scant government experience, serving brief stints as environment minister, family minister, and education minister.
The anger of the Socialist Party’s barons at Royal’s rise was amusing to observe.
She has yet to deal with the major problems of the day – financial instability, Europe’s sluggish growth, the Middle East – and she cannot avoid them during her campaign.
But, full of elegance and charm, and treating social problems with good sense and energy, she has topped public opinion polls for over a year.
So Sarkozy and Royal are universally expected to be the two leading candidates heading into the “High Noon” encounter of the second round.
But, judging from the past, this is not how French politics works.
Ever since de Gaulle, all candidates for the French presidency who started too early have lost.
Poher, Chaban-Delmas, Barre, Balladur, and I were picked out by the media and treated as candidates for more than two years before the election, whether declared or not, and we were all eventually beaten.
My own feeling is that the bombardment by the media is of such violence that the credibility of a candidate cannot endure for more than a few weeks.
Overexposure hurts.
So in this bizarre dance, where the big parties and important candidates know that it is better to start later, the real beneficiaries of today’s media circus are the candidates without any real chance of winning: a fascist, another extreme rightist, a communist, two Trotskyites, and a few other marginal personalities.
They are candidates only in order to benefit from two years of free publicity.
But those minor candidates underscore a deeper problem.
To be elected President of France, one needs more than charisma, a good program, and a strong political party.
One also must avoid the fragmentation that doomed the left in 2002, when none of its six candidates qualified for the second round, leaving Jacques Chirac, who had received 19% of the vote in the first round – a record low for a final winner ­– to defeat Jean-Marie Le Pen in the runoff with 82% of the vote.
The most openly conservative French government of the past decade was essentially elected by the left.
A repeat of this scenario seems possible: on the left, outside of the Socialist Party, there are already four announced candidates, and a fifth is likely.
On the right, Chirac’s antagonism toward Sarkozy makes it that another candidate will appear at some point, either Michele Alliot-Marie, the defense minister, or Chirac himself.
At this point, the main point to remember is that all of France’s last seven presidential elections have sprung a surprise.
The final result was never discernible in the polls more than six weeks in advance.
So, for the moment, the election is too far off to know or predict anything with certainty.
What we hear is idle speculation.
But at least the media are doing brisk business, and we are being entertained.
France’s Royal Visage
Ségolenè Royal has surged to the front of the pack of Socialists who aim to succeed Jacques Chirac as President of France.
Nobody would have bet a single euro on such a prospect a few months ago.
Until recently, Royal – who now is merely the head of one France’s 22 regional governments – was best known as the non-married partner of François Hollande, the Socialist Party leader.
Yet, according to the polls, she is the only left-leaning candidate who looks able to defeat Nicolas Sarkozy, the current Interior Minister and odds-on favorite to be the center-right’s standard bearer in the presidential election next May.
How did Royal rise so far and so fast?
One reason is that she is the only fresh face among those Socialists vying for the party nomination.
Laurent Fabius, Martine Aubry, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Jack Lang, and even Hollande are all former senior ministers who neutralized each other, while Lionel Jospin, the former Prime Minister, decided to put an end to his political career after his defeat in 2002.
Each of them has strengths and weaknesses, but none seems able to challenge Sarkozy.
Indeed, confronted with her lead, both Jospin and Hollande have dropped out of the race.
So there was a vacuum to fill, accompanied by a strong desire among the party faithful for revival.
Royal’s chief virtue is that she has not taken part in the numerous internal battles that infuriate socialist militants and voters, and her lack of direct association with the party’s leadership has enabled her to avoid blame for its mistakes.
That is why, far from being a disadvantage, her peripheral position is one of her main assets.
She has slim and politically minor ministerial experience – Environment Minister in 1992-1993, Deputy Minister for Secondary Education in 1997-2000, and Minister for Family Affairs in 2000-2002 – and has drawn attention mainly for her work on subjects related to daily problems, such as kids’ TV programs and mistreatment in schools.
But, while other politicians do not regard these matters as politically important, they mean a lot to most ordinary citizens.
That is why people tend to view her as a sincere politician, rather than one concerned only about personal ambition.
On security issues and education, Royal differs from the classical left, being something of a hardliner.
This, too, is an advantage in a country where security is the top priority for most people nowadays.
A mother of four children who proclaims to believe in traditional family values, she is attractive to right-wing voters, while her non-matrimonial relationship with Hollande makes her seem a quintessentially modern woman.
Moreover, being a woman is a great asset.
When disturbed by a question, she usually replies, “Would you have asked the same question to a man?”
Ever since Laurent Fabius took a hit in the polls when he mocked her candidacy by asking, “Who will mind the children?”, her opponents have feared appearing misogynous when attacking her, and when they do criticize her, she immediately assumes the pose of innocent victim, unfairly bashed by schoolboy bullies.
As a political tactician, she has also been innovative, organizing her campaign on the Internet with a plan to write her program from the responses of users.
Her motto, “My program is yours,” could prove popular with citizens who, as in many other democracies, do not trust their political elite.
Even though, like the majority of France’s political class, she was educated at Ecole Nationale d’Administration (ENA), she spurns the language and habits of this elite factory.
Last but not least, she is attractive.
Photos of her in a swimming suit, taken by paparazzi during the summer, triggered much discussion across France.
But the game is not over.
The Socialist will decide on November 17th who will be their candidate.
Trailing her in opinion polls, the other contenders cite her lack of credibility on economic policy and international relations.
No one knows her opinion on the Middle East, terrorism, nuclear deterrence, and international security.
During the recent Lebanon war, she called for Bill Clinton’s intervention – an insufficient answer for many people.
Royal’s lack of program has been her strength, but it could yet be her undoing.
Eventually, she will be obliged to abandon her studied ambiguity, and she will probably pay a price for doing so.
Few voters will support someone whose political program is based only on education and defense of the family.
Some Socialists fear that, once nominated, she would not be able to confront Sarkozy in direct debates.
Moreover, opinion polls in France are fickle omens.
Since 1981, no poll favorite has won the presidency.
According to the polls, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, not François Mitterrand, should have been elected in 1981.
In 1988, just months before the election, Raymond Barre (a former Prime Minister) was the arch-favorite, but did not even qualify for the second-round run-off.
A few weeks before the election in 1995, Jacques Chirac looked so weak that a journalist bluntly asked him on live TV whether it would not be better for him to give up.
And Jospin was considered the only possible winner in 2002, before finishing third, behind Chirac and Jean-Marie Le Pen.
But Royal is confident in her fate.
She is far from being a weak contender, and she is a fast learner with a strong campaign team.
If she can strengthen her program on foreign policy, she may yet open a new chapter in French political history.
France’s Third Man
Should we be watching the French presidential campaign with admiration or alarm?
Or perhaps a bit of both?
It is undeniably a great “show” with all the ingredients of a Hollywood blockbuster, including a surprising plot twist: the emergence of a “Third Man,” François Bayrou.
Even if his victory remains unlikely, Bayrou must now be taken seriously.
First and foremost, he has found in Ségolène Royal and Nicolas Sarkozy two remarkable spokespersons for his candidacy.
The more Royal returns to the “classics” of the Socialist Party, and the more Sarkozy openly courts the extreme right, the more Bayrou’s popularity rises.
Indeed, persistent doubts among the French about Royal’s competence and Sarkozy’s character are the primary reasons for his dramatic rise in public opinion polls, from 7% support at the start of the campaign to 22% now.
The second reason for Bayrou’s spectacular rise has less to do with personalities and more with France’s national mood.
The very reason that led a majority of the French to say “no” to the referendum on the European Union’s draft Constitutional Treaty in May 2005 may lead them to vote for Bayrou, the most pro-European of all candidates.
Why this paradox?
A vote that meant saying “no” to the Constitutional Treaty in 2005 now means saying “no” to the leaders of the French left and right.
In the 2002 presidential election, frustration with the system fueled strong support for the extremes, with Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of the far right, qualifying for the second-round runoff.
In 2007, by contrast – and this constitutes real progress – a large segment of the French population is expressing its frustration with the system by being tempted to vote for the “extreme center,” i.e., Bayrou.
Bayrou has been in politics for a long time, including as a presidential candidate in 2002.
But, while his record as education minister is far from impressive, he has successfully reinvented his image in the last few months, becoming the “new man” of French politics.
He looks more reassuring than Sarkozy and sounds more competent than Royal.
This would not be enough for Bayrou in ordinary times, but today, on both sides of the political divide, opponents of the main candidates seem ready to join forces with him and betray their respective camps.
What makes Bayrou potentially so strong is the fact that widespread reservations about the two leading candidates are influencing the calculus of militants and politicians alike.
On the conservative side, Jacques Chirac now officially supports Sarkozy, but he may also secretly encourage his most loyal supporters to vote for Bayrou, even if there is no love lost between the two men.
On the left, the social democratic wing of the Socialist party, which backed Dominique Strauss-Kahn against Royal, may be tempted to align with Bayrou, too, owing to the prospect of a post-electoral alliance between the center left and the center right.
That said, surveys of the electorate demonstrate that a large proportion is still undecided, particularly among Bayrou’s supporters.
So it is too early to say whether Bayrou can reach the second round.
But if he does, he is likely to prove irresistible.
A Bayrou victory, which is unlikely but not impossible, would constitute a triple revolution.
It would lead first to the end of the Socialist Party created by François Mitterrand.
Following Lionel Jospin’s humiliating defeat in 2002, the Socialists simply would not survive a second consecutive failure to reach the second round.
Moreover, a Bayrou victory could signify the end of the conservative party created by Chirac, as well as of Charles de Gaulle’s Fifth Republic.
But de Gaulle’s legacy would most likely be snuffed out gently, with nostalgia for both Mitterrand and Chirac possibly proving very tempting for a people disaffected with the political system but desiring to be reassured.
France wants the illusion of change, but is continuity what she truly desires?.
Finally, while this election was expected to usher in a new generation of politicians, few were prepared to anticipate the peaceful political tsunami that a Bayrou victory would bring.
Yet that would be the outcome if the attraction towards the center proves to be as irresistible for significant segments of the Socialists and conservative parties as it now seems .
France is a marvelously paradoxical country, so the search for novelty, if not modernity, could lead to the reinvention of the Fourth Republic, a parliamentary regime characterized by its weaknesses and instability.
That will depend in part on whether the perception of Sarkozy as a risky candidate will prove greater than the very real institutional risk represented by Bayrou.
There is maybe less of a French presence in the world today than there was twelve years ago when Jacques Chirac came to power, especially since the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in 2005.
But the world’s interest in the French presidential campaign is greater than ever, and can be compared only with the attention generated by Mitterrand’s election in 1981.
Much may change in the few weeks left before the first round of the presidential vote.
But the campaign has now become a question of numbers: will the Third Man bury the Fifth Republic?
Good Crop, Bad Crop
NAIROBI – Kenya’s ban on imports of genetically modified (GM) crops reflects a troubling trend in a country traditionally seen as an agricultural innovator.
The move also represents a giant leap backward for a continent that often struggles to ensure its own food security.
A rational, scientific approach must triumph over prejudice, fear, and speculation.
And Kenya can lead the way.
GM crops (also called genetically engineered or biotechnology crops) have repeatedly been proven to be safe, and are used successfully to boost agricultural productivity worldwide.
But bureaucracy, propaganda, and misinformation are preventing millions of African farmers, including in Kenya, from accessing a technology that can improve livelihoods and help to redress food shortages.
More than one million Kenyans currently rely on food aid as a result of the country’s cereal shortfall.
The country’s Famine Early Warning Systems Network notes that already-high maize prices will continue to rise until the end of the year, further straining food security and economic performance.
As Kenya struggles to feed its people and stabilize its economy, GM technology should be a welcome means to increase yields and incomes, benefiting farmers, consumers, and the environment.
The few African countries that do grow GM crops have reaped significant rewards.
The introduction of GM maize, soybean, and cotton in South Africa, for example, helped raise farmers’ incomes by more than $1 billion from 1998 to 2012.
This was largely the result of GM maize varieties, which increased annual yields by 32%, and now represent nearly 90% of the country’s maize crop.
Indeed, despite soaring output, South Africa still cannot export enough maize to keep pace with global demand.
Similarly, Burkina Faso’s farmers now grow a GM cotton variety that naturally resists a destructive insect, and thus requires less expensive pesticides.
The switch from traditional cotton to the GM variety has helped increase yields by more than 18%, earning farmers $61 more per hectare and raising $1.2 billion in agricultural revenues in 2013 alone.
As an agricultural technology pioneer, Kenya’s farmers would undoubtedly enjoy similar returns.
Three-quarters of Kenya’s food is grown by small-scale farmers – the type that produce more than 90% of the world’s GM crops.
Kenyans are already expected to benefit enormously from new GM varieties, such as insect-resistant maize, that are being developed by local scientists.
Moreover, Kenya is one of the few African countries with a robust regulatory framework that can review and approve new crop varieties.
Kenya’s 2009 Biosafety Act established the National Biosafety Authority (NBA), one of the first such bodies on the continent.
Yet, despite early advances in the field, Kenya’s battle for GM crops has been unnecessarily political.
In 2012, the cabinet banned GM crop imports without even consulting the NBA, a decision based on a widely denounced, and since-retracted, study that falsely linked GM foods with cancer.
More recently, Kenya’s government appointed a special taskforce to investigate biotechnology.
Its findings have not yet been made public, but anti-GM comments by the taskforce’s chair suggest further confusion on the issue, threatening to leave farmers, scientists, and the public in limbo at a time when GM crops are most needed.
A clear opportunity to feed the population is being squandered as a result of politics and bureaucracy, and Kenya, unfortunately, is not alone in Africa in this regard.
Badly needed biosafety legislation in Nigeria and Uganda, for example, has already been delayed.
Much of the problem lies with a small group of anti-GM activists who object to the technology on “moral” grounds.
They typically claim that GM crops are unsafe – a view flatly rejected by the scientific community over the last two decades.
The World Health Organization has also confirmed that “no effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of such foods.”
Indeed, every new GM crop variety must meet rigorous health, environmental, and efficacy standards.
Although perhaps well intentioned, these activists, together with a few misinformed policymakers, are setting back agricultural technology and productivity across Africa.
To be sure, GM crops are no panacea, but they are an important tool in achieving food security and economic prosperity.
That is why decisions about the health and safety of new crop varieties should be based on scientific evidence, not driven by political wrangling and baseless “moral” arguments.
By taking an evidence-based approach to policymaking, Kenya’s authorities can improve millions of lives at home and set an invaluable precedent for the whole continent.
A Meeting of Minds on HIV/AIDS
GENEVA – An ounce of prevention, Benjamin Franklin famously said, is worth a pound of cure.
But that is not always true when it comes to research into infectious diseases.
Though scientists have traditionally tended to focus on either prevention or cure, defeating the HIV/AIDS virus will require researchers – and their funders – to collaborate to address the challenge from both directions.
Advances in prevention and treatment have reduced annual HIV infections by one-third over the past decade, and cut AIDS-related deaths by 30% over the past five years.
Yet 35 million people still live with the virus.
Last year, 2.1 million became infected, and 1.5 million died from AIDS-related causes.
Even in the best-case scenario for maximizing existing prevention and treatment, at least a half-million new HIV infections would occur annually in low- and middle-income countries by 2050.
The world needs a vaccine and a cure to get ahead of the disease, and great progress is being made in both areas.
But, though research in these two distinct fields is beginning to overlap, too many scientists still see themselves as being strictly on one side or the other.
The mechanisms for funding HIV/AIDS research reinforce this separation, because they rarely allow for – much less invite – the kind of innovative cross-field approaches that will be needed to translate recent breakthroughs into testable products.
The divide is apparent even among activists and advocates for HIV/AIDS research.
It must not be allowed to prevent further progress.
Because HIV/AIDS is already the world’s most studied infectious disease, an HIV diagnosis is no longer a death sentence.
Yet we are still far from defeating the virus.
Infection rates continue to rise in specific regions and populations, and more than half of the people living with HIV worldwide do not even know that they have it.
Three of five HIV-positive people still are not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
Moreover, long-term treatment is not the same as a cure, and no public-health tool (apart from clean drinking water) has ever matched the preventive power of a vaccine.
HIV is an extremely complex virus.
It mutates rapidly within an individual and among geographic locations, establishing latent reservoirs within cells that enable it to emerge and replicate months or even years later.
It evades the immune system, so the body’s natural ability to fight or clear it is limited.
Although there are no precedents that might guide us to a vaccine or cure, we have learned a lot about how HIV works – and its weaknesses – in the last five years.
In 2009, for example, researchers found so-called “proof of concept” when a clinical trial showed that a vaccine could prevent HIV infection in humans, and Timothy Ray Brown (known as “the Berlin patient”) was cured of HIV via a bone-marrow transplant.
Researchers are also learning a great deal from the responses of three groups of patients.
The first group comprises “post-treatment controllers,” in whom early treatment allowed for long-term control of the infection even after antiretroviral therapy was stopped.
The second group are “elite controllers,” who can carry HIV for ten years or more without treatment and without falling ill.
The third group, “elite neutralizers,” includes patients who naturally produce antibodies against a wide range of HIV variants.
With the insights gained from following these patients, researchers are increasingly beginning to recognize that the same science may bring us to both a vaccine and a cure.
The two research paths, long pursued in separate labs and discrete projects, have been converging in several exciting areas.
For example, scientists working to design a vaccine that will induce production of broadly neutralizing antibodies to protect people from HIV infection have found that these antibodies also control and even clear infection by the simian version of the virus in monkeys.
A similar result, dubbed a “functional cure,” has been achieved with a simian vaccine aimed at inducing a response by the monkeys’ “killer T-cells,” another weapon in the immune system’s arsenal.
Meanwhile, cure-focused studies of elite controllers are yielding clues about regions of the virus that mutate less, which could hold important lessons for vaccine researchers.
As science advances across disciplines and diseases in ways that were unimaginable even five years ago, the research walls that divide prevention and cure must fall.
We must stop weighing pounds against ounces, and collaborate to develop the tools needed to eliminate the HIV/AIDS scourge once and for all.
François Hollande Meets the World
PARIS – When François Hollande, fresh from his election as France’s next president, was asked by a journalist which language he would use when he meets US President Barack Obama for the first time, his answer was revealing. “I speak English more fluently than the former president,” the Socialist leader insisted, referring to the outgoing Nicolas Sarkozy.
“But a French president must speak French!”
In proclaiming his mastery of the lingua franca of global affairs, Hollande was asserting himself as a modern statesman, while also suggesting that France will remain as influential as possible on the international scene.
Indeed, he was proclaiming his commitment to internationalism and multilateralism.
In order to remain a country that punches above its weight diplomatically, it is in France’s interest to operate through international organizations rather than to rely on bilateral relationships.
Hollande is also aware that, for historical and cultural reasons, France’s international role must be different from that of other countries.
In his book Changer de destin (Changing Destiny), published in February, he affirms that France’s message will continue to be a universal one – a stance reminiscent of the birth in 1789 of the French Republic, which, like the United States, was originally conceived as the triumph of liberty and democracy.
Unlike in France, however, the word “socialist” is an epithet for most Americans.
But this could be a source of strength for Hollande, who, as a new leader with no foreign-policy experience, will have to prove his ability through action.
And here, Obama, in particular, will soon understand that Hollande has no intention of bringing sweeping change.
On the contrary, his intention will be to appear as a reliable and unsurprising partner.
Hollande is unlikely to be less friendly with America than was Sarkozy, regarded by many as France’s most pro-US president.
Hollande supported the military intervention in Libya in 2011, and has joined the condemnation of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
One of his close political allies recently declared that should the United Nations Security Council approve military intervention in Syria, France “could envision” participating in that effort.
Hollande also supports a tough line on Iran and, regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, his book indicates that he subscribes to the “Clinton parameters” – two states with secure borders and a status for Jerusalem that is acceptable to both sides.
With regard to relations between France and the Arab world, one can be certain that Hollande would agree with the pro-engagement thrust of Obama’s 2009 Cairo speech.
Last but not least, Hollande is not likely to call into question Sarkozy’s decision in 2009 to reintegrate France into NATO’s military command.
That decision remains controversial in France, including among Socialists, but Hollande is well aware of the weaknesses of a European defense policy that simply cannot compete with NATO.
Nevertheless, at the NATO Summit in Chicago at the end of May, Hollande will confirm his pledge to withdraw French troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2012, two years ahead of the NATO timetable (though he recognizes the need to negotiate the practical details).
This will be an important test of Hollande’s ability to deal effectively with allies.
The second test of his ability to negotiate with other leaders will be within Europe.
One of the highest-flying proposals of his electoral platform was a call for renegotiation of the European Union’s new “fiscal pact,” endorsed by all member states with the exception of the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic.
Inspired by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, approval of the pact was a precondition for Germany’s participation in the financial rescue plan for Greece and the other distressed eurozone countries.
Hollande’s proposal was initially regarded as lèse-majesté against Germany.
Now all European leaders – from Mario Monti in Italy to Mariano Rajoy in Spain and Elio Di Rupo in Belgium – agree on the need to revive the European economy.
So do Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, EU Council President Herman Van Rompuy, and, indeed, Merkel herself.
Merkel and Hollande will discuss the main question – how to spur economic growth without increasing public debt – on May 15 in Berlin.
While Merkel opposes Hollande’s proposal to create Eurobonds with a view to financing industrial projects, they cannot afford to waste time in reassuring jittery markets with a message of cohesion.
Merkel has already welcomed Hollande’s ideas for a growth plan for Europe.
Hollande, too, will have to make concessions.
For the French, as for all Europeans, the EU is not a foreign entity, and its decisions are an integral part of domestic policies.
In this regard, Hollande has a chance to succeed on the international scene as a truly pro-European leader.
Only a stronger Europe will ensure fair trade with emerging countries, especially China.
Only a stronger Europe will at last implement the principle of reciprocity in order to protect European businesses and prevent them from relocating, which has been the main cause of unemployment.
In a recent interview, Hollande declared that, “France is not just any European country, and its president is not just any world leader.”
The French are happy to hear that.
But that affirmation also represents Hollande’s main challenge: ensuring that this remains true in the context of twenty-first-century globalization.
François Hollande’s Wrong Idea of France
LONDON – France’s new president, François Hollande, has achieved a remarkable series of political victories – at home and in Europe – since his election in May.
Unfortunately, his streak of success will inevitably call forth an economic reckoning that will shock France’s apparently unsuspecting citizens and doom the French elite’s approach to the “construction of Europe.”
Since winning the presidency, Hollande has won a parliamentary majority and pushed Germany toward accepting joint liability for eurozone countries’ debts.
But forebodings of crisis have become widespread in French business and economic circles.
But the real danger – which even Hollande’s sternest critics may be underestimating – is not so much his individual policy failings (serious though they may be) as his approach to the twin challenges posed by France’s economic imbalances and the eurozone crisis.
On each front separately, he might manage to muddle through; together, they look likely to cement France’s loss of competitiveness.
Declining competitiveness is best captured in a single indicator: unit labor costs, which measure the average cost of labor per unit of output.
In a monetary union, discrepancies in wage growth relative to productivity gains – that is, unit labor costs – will result in a chronic accumulation of trade surpluses or deficits.
Since the euro’s introduction, unit labor costs have risen dramatically faster in France than they have in Germany.
According to Eurostat data published in April 2011, the hourly labor cost in France was €34.2, compared to €30.1 in Germany – and nearly 20% higher than the eurozone average of €27.6.
France’s current-account deficit has risen to more than 2% of GDP, even as its economic growth has ground to a halt.
The high cost of employing workers in France is due not so much to wages and benefits as it is to payroll taxes levied on employers.
The entire French political class has long delighted in taxing labor to finance the country’s generous welfare provisions, thus avoiding excessively high taxation of individuals’ income and consumption – though that is about to come to an end as Hollande intends to slap a 75% tax on incomes above €1 million.
This is a version of the fallacy that taxing companies (“capital”) spares ordinary people (“workers”).
Of course, such taxes on firms are always passed on to households – usually through straightforward price hikes, and, in France, also through unemployment.
High tax rates on labor – together with rigid regulation of hiring and firing – make employers extremely reluctant to recruit workers.
As a result, France has had chronic long-term unemployment – forecast to reach 10.5% by 2013 – for many years.
Hollande’s predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, tried to address this problem.
He exempted voluntary overtime pay from employment tax and shifted some of the burden of labor taxation onto consumption (via a hike in VAT).
But Hollande quickly reversed both of these reforms.
The repeal of the tax break on overtime reflects another economic fallacy to which French Socialist politicians are deeply attached: the “lump of labor” notion that underlay the most disastrous of their economic policies – the 35-hour workweek, introduced in 2000.
The idea behind the policy is that demand for labor is a constant, and that this fixed number of aggregate working hours required by employers to meet final demand can be spread more evenly among workers to reduce unemployment.
Such measures, designed to create jobs by freeing up work hours, are futile at best, and are often detrimental.
French Socialists should recall their school physics lesson about communicating vessels: when a homogeneous liquid is poured into a set of connected containers, it settles at the same level in all of them, regardless of their shape and volume.
Generating more “liquid” (jobs) requires not discouraging the entrepreneurs on whose activities sustainable job creation ultimately depends.
The effect of fiscal and regulatory pressure on employment is to encourage French firms to invest and hire outside France.
Hollande’s apologists praise his gradualist and consensual approach to addressing the economy’s structural distortions.
They argue that his penchant for setting up consultative commissions is the best way to forge the consensus required for structural reform, whereas Sarkozy’s combative style was counterproductive.
Even banishing skepticism and assuming that Hollande could over time persuade his supporters to embrace competitiveness-boosting policies, the eurozone crisis is denying France the time that such gradualism requires.
A simple, effective way to buy time would be to abandon the euro and restore competitiveness through a devalued national currency.
But this expedient is incompatible with mainstream French politicians’ devotion to the “European project,” which amounts to a projection of French soft power; indeed, building Europe lies at the heart of the French establishment’s version of what Charles de Gaulle used to call “a certain idea of France.”
For mainstream French politicians, renouncing the European project to buy the time required to restore competitiveness is as unthinkable as is the logical alternative: an all-out push for full European political union.
This would reestablish monetary sovereignty and create a normal central bank (like the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England) at the European level.
But it would also mean abandoning France’s republic in favor of a federal European government – anathema to that “certain idea of France.”
The combination of gradualism (on the most generous interpretation) in domestic economic reform and the paralyzing effect of the eurozone crisis will lead to a massive shock.
Remaining in a currency union with the much more competitive German economy will require wrenching and rapid reforms, for which Hollande’s tepid approach will fail to prepare the complacent French.
The result will be even more support than was seen in last April’s presidential election for extremist political parties that reject both Europe and competitive market capitalism.
The Circular Revolution
DAVOS – In the sixteenth century, the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus made a profound discovery: the sun, not the earth, was at the center of the known universe.
At the time, many denounced Copernicus’s insight as heresy against established Christian doctrine; eventually, of course, the Copernican Revolution paved the way toward a new, scientific worldview and enhanced human prosperity.
Today, the world needs a similar paradigm shift.
But this time it is the prevailing economic model that must be transformed.
By 2030, the global middle class will total nearly five billion people, all of whom will expect the same kinds of opportunities and comforts that wealthy populations have long enjoyed.
This will put increasing strain on the environment and deplete the world’s stock of resources.
The problem is that the world has long maintained a myopic focus on producing and consuming goods as cheaply as possible.
The result is a linear economy based on the rapid use, disposal, and replacement of goods.
Sustaining the current model would require unlimited, easily accessible resources and infinite space for waste – something that clearly is not possible.
Indeed, the consequences of our disposable economy – skyrocketing CO2 emissions, unmanageable waste streams, and the increasing difficulty of extracting resources, to name a few – are already apparent.
To find a sustainable alternative, one need only look to nature, where nothing is wasted.
Forests, for example, are completely efficient systems, with species’ lifecycles occurring in perfect harmony with the seasons.
This underpins levels of resilience and longevity that economic systems should strive to emulate.
Just as ecosystems reuse everything in an efficient and purposeful cycle, a “circular” economic system would ensure that products were designed to be part of a value network, within which the reuse and refurbishment of products, components, and materials would ensure the continual re-exploitation of resources.
Of course, building a circular economy would require a fundamental restructuring of global value chains.
Instead of selling products, businesses would retain ownership, selling the use of the goods they make as a service.
Selling a product’s benefits instead of the product itself would create a powerful incentive for producers to design for longevity, repeated reuse, and eventual recycling, which would enable them to optimize their use of resources.
This requires a new generation of materials, as well as innovative development and production processes.
It also demands new business models, a redefined concept of legal ownership and use, new public-tendering rules, and novel financing strategies.
Finally, a circular economy calls for adaptive logistics and a leadership culture that embraces the new system and rewards progress toward establishing it.
Beyond the moral imperative, there is a strong financial argument in favor of the transition to a circular economy – namely, the promise of over $1 trillion in business opportunities.
This includes material savings, increased productivity, new jobs, and possibly new product and business categories.
But businesses cannot transform the economy alone.
In order to shift firms’ emphasis from minimizing initial costs to maximizing total value, while ensuring the protection of people’s health and well-being, governments should change their tendering processes by implementing requirements for circularity, thereby helping to drive demand for new solutions.
At the same time, consumers must be open to using products that they do not own.
Because the circular economy is inherently systemic, it can succeed only if all stakeholders co-design, co-create, and co-own products and services.
With this in mind, my company is redesigning its products and considering how to capture their residual value.
At the same time, it is shifting from a transaction- to a relationship-based business model – one that entails closer cooperation with customers and suppliers.
And it is changing its corporate culture to emphasize long-term solutions.
None of these changes is easy to implement, but all of them are necessary.
Like all major transitions in human history, the shift from a linear to a circular economy will be a tumultuous one.
It will feature pioneers and naysayers, victories and setbacks.
But, if businesses, governments, and consumers each do their part, the Circular Revolution will put the global economy on a path of sustainable long-term growth – and, 500 years from now, people will look back at it as a revolution of Copernican proportions.
A Concert of Indo-Pacific Democracies
TOKYO – On his week-long tour of Asia, US Vice President Mike Pence has been promoting a vision of a “free and open” Indo-Pacific region, characterized by unimpeded trade flows, freedom of navigation, and respect for the rule of law, national sovereignty, and existing frontiers.
The question is whether this vision of an Indo-Pacific free of “authoritarianism and aggression” is achievable.
One country that seems willing to contribute to realizing this vision is Japan.
In fact, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is the originator of the “free and open Indo-Pacific” concept that lies at the heart of President Donald Trump’s new strategy, the successor to Barack Obama’s unhinged “pivot” to Asia.
Having historically punched above its weight internationally, Japan is responding to China’s muscular rise by strengthening its own position in the region.
Taking advantage of its considerable assets – the world’s third-largest economy, substantial high-tech skills, and a military that has recently been freed of some legal and constitutional constraints – Japan is boosting its geopolitical clout.
Japan’s world-class navy has already begun operating far beyond the country’s waters in order to establish its position in the region.
For example, in order to challenge China’s claims in the South China Sea, a Japanese submarine and three destroyers carried out naval drills there in September.
“Japan’s willingness to participate in Asian security,” former US Defense Secretary Ash Carter recently said, “makes it an increasingly important player in the region.”
But creating a free and open Indo-Pacific is not the job of one country alone.
Establishing the stable balance of power needed to realize Pence’s vision will require all of the region’s major democracies – from Japan and India to Indonesia and Australia – to come together.
The good news is that Abe seems to recognize the importance of cooperation among Asia’s democratic powers.
For example, in discussing the natural alliance between the region’s richest democracy and its largest one, he declared: “A strong India benefits Japan, and a strong Japan benefits India.”
With that in mind, Abe and his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, recently held a summit that opened the way for a military logistics pact that would give each country’s armed forces access to the other’s bases.
Beyond instituting a joint “two plus two” dialogue among the countries’ foreign and defense ministers, Abe and Modi agreed to deepen naval and maritime-security cooperation and collaborate on projects in third countries, including Myanmar, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, to enhance strategic connectivity in the Indo-Pacific.
At the summit, Japan and India devised a new motto for the bilateral relationship: “Shared security, shared prosperity, and shared destiny.”
The comfort and camaraderie shown by Abe and Modi during their meeting, held at Abe’s private vacation home near Mount Fuji, stood in stark contrast to the stony expressions and somber handshakes on display when, just two days earlier, Abe had met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing.
Cooperation between India and Japan builds on, among other things, the trilateral India-Japan-US “Malabar” naval exercises.
Malabar has become an important component of the effort to defend freedom of navigation and overflight in the Indo-Pacific region, through which two-thirds of global trade travels.
If India signed a military logistics agreement with Japan, as it has with the US, the Indian navy would be better able to expand its footprint to the western Pacific, while enabling Japan to project its naval power in the Indian Ocean.
Fortunately, relations among the Indo-Pacific’s four key maritime democracies – Australia, India, Japan, and the US – are stronger than ever, characterized by high-level linkages and intelligence-sharing.
These countries should institutionalize their “quad” initiative, with the India-Japan dyad forming the cornerstone of efforts to pursue wider collaboration in the region.
But such collaboration will face considerable obstacles.
For starters, the relationship between Japan and America’s other closest East Asian ally, South Korea, continues to be held hostage by history.
The issue of “comfort women,” Korean women who were coerced into providing sexual services to Japanese troops during World War II, has long been particularly contentious.
A 2015 agreement, endorsed by Abe and former South Korean President Park Geun-hye, claimed to resolve the issue “irreversibly”: Japan offered its apology and one billion yen ($8.8 million) for a fund created to help the victims.
But, earlier this year, Park’s successor, Moon Jae-in, rejected the deal, arguing that it did not adequately serve the victims or the public.
More recently, South Korea’s Supreme Court ordered a major Japanese steelmaker to compensate the “victims of forced labor” during Japan’s colonial rule of Korea, even though a 1965 bilateral agreement was supposed to have settled “completely and finally” all such claims.
The rancorous relationship between Japan and South Korea plays directly into China’s hands.
While South Korea obviously should not disregard its history, it should find a way to move past its colonial subjugation and form new, mutually beneficial relationships with Japan, much as India, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Indonesia have done with their former colonizers.
Another potential impediment to a concert of Indo-Pacific democracies is domestic instability in key countries.
In strategically located Sri Lanka, for example, President Maithripala Sirisena has ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe (despite the latter’s parliamentary majority) and called a snap election, even though the constitution does not give him the power to do either.
A weakening of the country’s democracy could have strategic ramifications for an economically integrated but politically divided Indo-Pacific.
Nonetheless, the deepening relationship between Japan and India serves the goal of forestalling the emergence of a China-centric Asia.
If Japan and India – after China, the region’s most influential countries – can leverage their relationship to generate progress toward a broader concert of democracies in the region, the vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific may be achievable after all.
Freedom, Blasphemy, and Violence
PARIS – Violent attacks on US diplomatic outposts across North Africa and the Middle East have once again raised the question of how to respond when Americans and other Westerners engage in provocative expression that others consider blasphemous.
Though the attack on the US diplomatic mission in Benghazi, in which Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three members of his staff were murdered, may well have been planned, as the State Department has maintained, the killers clearly exploited the opportunity created by outrage at an anti-Muslim film produced in the US.
There have been several episodes in recent years in which perceptions of blasphemy have led to threats of violence or actual killings, starting with the publication of Salman Rushdie’s novel The Satanic Verses more than two decades ago, and including the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten’s cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.
In the Netherlands, Theo Van Gogh was murdered on an Amsterdam sidewalk in retaliation for his film Submission, which criticized Islam’s treatment of women.
Even some who defended freedom of expression in those cases may be disinclined to do so now.
This time, the film that triggered riots in Cairo, Benghazi, Sana, and elsewhere is so crude and inflammatory as to seem clearly intended to elicit the outrage that it produced.
Yet judgments about literary or artistic merit should not be the basis for decisions about freedom of expression.
The proclivity of some elsewhere to react violently to what they consider blasphemous cannot be the criterion for imposing limits on free expression in the US, the United Kingdom, Denmark, or the Netherlands (or anywhere else).
It is important to differentiate blasphemy from hate speech.
What is objectionable about hate speech, and makes it punishable by law in countries around the world, is that it is intended to incite discrimination or violence against members of a particular national, racial, ethnic, or religious group.
Even in the US, where freedom of expression is zealously protected, such incitement may be prosecuted and punished in circumstances in which violence or other unlawful behavior is imminent.
By contrast, in cases of blasphemy, it is not the speaker (or the filmmaker) who is directly inciting discrimination or violence. Rather, it is those who are enraged by the expressed views who may threaten or actually engage in violence, either against the speaker, or against those, like US government officials, whom they believe have facilitated (or failed to suppress) the blasphemer’s activities.
It is, of course, impossible to be certain what will arouse such anger.
At times, as seems to be the case with the video that triggered the current protests in cities across North Africa and the Middle East, a long period may elapse between the offensive material’s dissemination and an outpouring of popular rage.
The rage, it seems, is not spontaneous; rather, it is an artifact of local or regional politics.
This does not diminish the irresponsibility of those who gratuitously engage in such offensive behavior, but it does make clear that outrage against their actions should not be a basis for abandoning our commitment to freedom of expression.
What, then, is to be done?
The only appropriate response is the one chosen by the US Embassy in Cairo, which denounced the film and said that the American government condemns those who offend others’ religious beliefs.
And Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reinforced the condemnation when she called the film “disgusting and reprehensible.”
Plainly, that was not enough to deter those who sought an occasion to attack the US Consulate in Benghazi.
If they had not grasped this opportunity, they would have sought another.
Simply condemning a film will not mean much to those who believe that, as may be true in their own countries, a powerful government like that of the US can simply decide whether a film should be made or broadcast.
Though the statement from the US Embassy in Cairo has become the target of political criticism, it warrants praise for exemplifying American values.
Contrary to the criticism, condemnation of the film is not censorship.
While rejecting censorship, the US government should not renounce its authority to speak sensibly and condemn an appalling and apparently intentional provocation that produced such tragic consequences.
Freedom, Not Democracy, For Russia
Twenty years ago this month, Mikhail Gorbachev began his policies of perestroika and glasnost, which led to the end of the Cold War.
Now, however, a new chill has entered relations between Russia and the West.
President Vladimir Putin is frequently criticized for taking Russia in the wrong direction.
The very people who in 2000 called Putin a man they could do business with are having second thoughts.
People once fascinated by Putin now publicly rebuke him.
Putin is shooting back, accusing the West of trying to weaken and dismember Russia.
As politicians in the West compare him to Mugabe or Mussolini, Putin’s Kremlin aides invoke the Munich appeasers who tried to push Hitler eastward.
Putin himself once blamed the West for trying to channel Muslim radicalism toward Russia.
Why this sharp change in tone?
Initially, most nations exiting from Communism reached out, almost instinctively, to their immediate pre-Communist period.
The Baltic states revived their constitutions of the 1930’s, the Armenians and the Azeris revived their political parties of the late 1910’s, and Eastern Europe, with the exception of East Germany, which reunited with the Federal Republic, suddenly became once again Mitteleuropa.
This revival of the past was a big worry for West Europeans and Americans, who feared the re-emergence of historical enmities and tensions, which did indeed come to the fore in the former Yugoslavia.
These fears underpinned the dual enlargement of NATO and the European Union.
Russia, for its part, also went backwards, to tsarism.
Initially, this was not obvious to all.
Boris Yeltsin was friendly to the West, tolerated open debate, and appointed a few individuals as oligarchs.
He was given the benefit of the doubt, and his anti-Communism was elevated to a surrogate of democracy.
Russia was doubtless freer than ever before, in virtually all respects, good and bad.
But the picture Russia presented to others and to itself was massively distorted.
Parliament was lively, but essentially powerless.
The electronic media were routinely critical of the authorities, but were owned by a handful of people and depended on their owners’ taste, interests, and fate.
Yeltsin’s handover of power to Putin, like a king with his dauphin, tells us more about his regime than almost anything else.
Putin’s regime is openly tsarist.
His Duma is much like the Duma of Nicholas II, docile and acquiescent.
His governors are also like Nicholas’s; many are governor-generals.
The capitalism now being practiced is dependent on the authorities, and plays no independent role in politics.
Of course, this does not mean that there is no difference between the Russia of Vladimir Putin and Nicholas Romanov.
What it means is that Russia is back on its historical path of development, back at the point where things started to go wrong.
The domestic situation, the global environment, and the historical memory of its people all militate against Russia being bound to relive its own tragic history.
But Russia is like Western Europe, in the sense that it will have to advance in stages.
It is not like Central Europe, which could leapfrog over some of them by jumping on the NATO/EU springboard.
This means that we need to be more careful in using the language of democracy when talking about Russia.
Democracy almost everywhere has been a fairly late child of capitalism, for it requires a self-conscious middle class to take root and flourish.
This can only be produced by successful and sustained capitalist development.
Russia is generating it, but the process will take time.
Meanwhile, politics belongs to the elites.
If Russia is to move forward, its high and mighty must agree about who owns what, who makes the rules, and how to change the rules.
Rather than calling for democracy, this calls for a genuine constitutional rule of law.
In other words, the task is to turn tsarist Russia into a version of the Kaiser’s Germany.
This won’t be easy, but there are good reasons for optimism.
With so much being written about Putin’s Russia, the rest of the country is often overlooked.
Putin’s Russia is essentially about the Kremlin and the bureaucracy.
They are dominant, no doubt, but they are not Russia in its entirety.
The millions of consumers exercising their right to choose in the rapidly growing supermarket chains; the planeloads of business travelers converging on London, Zurich, and Frankfurt daily; the holiday-makers who, having lost the Crimea, have rediscovered the Mediterranean – all are part of a Russia beyond Putin’s Russia, one that will grow and develop even when Putin is history.
So Russia’s current agenda must be more about freedom than democracy.
Even now, Russia, though undemocratic, is largely free.
What it needs is to institutionalize that freedom by building a modern state to replace the antiquated tsarist system.
It also needs a modern civil society to consolidate its multi-ethnic post-imperial population.
This calls for a kind of liberalism that is now lacking in Russia, one that stands for freedom, reform, and the nation-state.
Neither the government nor the current opposition possesses it, which means that Russians must look beyond Putin’s Russia.
As for the West, it is fruitless to try to bring Putin and his team back to democracy, where Russia does not belong, or to punish Russia with sanctions, which won’t work.
The West must recognize where Russia stands on history’s timeline and not seek to wish this away.
The political gap can be narrowed only by indigenous capitalist development.
In the meantime, America and Europe should base their policies toward Russia on mutual interests, not the expectation of mutual values.
Why Freedom of Assembly Still Matters
PRINCETON – It is now common knowledge that many democracies around the world are under pressure.
But mounting threats to a particularly important democratic right have not received nearly enough attention. Through various means, governments are making it harder for citizens to assemble and protest.
New restrictions on the right to assemble often come with innocuous-sounding justifications such as “public safety.”
In the United States, the Trump administration has asserted a prerogative to recover cleaning fees after demonstrations, effectively allowing the government to charge protesters for exercising their constitutional right.
And in an even more blatant effort to curtail public dissent, the administration has tried to bar assemblies from 80% of the sidewalks around the White House.
Similarly, in Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán recently had legislation passed which makes it more difficult to demonstrate near private residences and national monuments, citing the potential of protests to “disturb the ordinary flow of traffic.”
The authorities also want to ban demonstrations on state occasions.
With vague justifications, the government can now make street demonstrations virtually impossible.
Some might not think that hollowing out the right of assembly is as serious as other threats to democracy, not least partisan gerrymandering and voter suppression.
After all, given the seemingly boundless possibilities to assemble virtually, the availability of physical space can appear less important.
In fact, protests in streets and public squares are essential to democratic life.
The right to assemble freely emerged from the right to petition kings.
Historically, it has always been subject to more prior restraints than has speech.
Even in many well-functioning democracies, public authorities try to keep crowds away from official government buildings.
In the US, for example, demonstrators could not assemble close to Congress until the early 1970s, when the Supreme Court finally rejected the argument that Capitol Hill was an especially dignified space deserving of refuge from the unwashed masses.
Yet, to this day, politically vocal crowds are routinely portrayed as uncontrollable mobs.
For a recent example of this, consider how Bernard Kerik, a former New York City police commissioner , accused those protesting against Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court of hindering “the orderly functioning of public institutions.”
Still, is protesting outside particular public buildings really necessary?
The Internet may not be the unalloyed democratizing force that many first thought it was, but it nevertheless opens up vast possibilities for “assembly” and expressing dissent online.
Consider Emma González, a previously unknown Florida teenager who “assembled” two times more Twitter followers than the National Rifle Association almost overnight.
By following an eloquent survivor of the Parkland massacre, 1.66 million Twitter users have signaled their support for stronger gun-control regulations, and their opposition to the US gun lobby.
Nonetheless, assembly in physical space fulfills functions for democracy that online activity, however permanent or passionate, simply cannot.
In 2011, when then-US Representative Barney Frank asked why Occupy Wall Street protesters “think that simply being in a physical place does much,” an appropriate answer would have been: “Actually, occupying public spaces can accomplish a great deal, depending on who the occupiers are and how many they number.”
Hence, the civil rights marchers in the US during the 1950s and 1960s often evoked the “meaning of our numbers.”
The sheer “mass” of citizens who were willing to come out – often at the risk of physical harm – lent credence to the cause.
This may sound very basic, but, as Trump’s obsession with his relatively small inauguration crowd shows, size still matters.
“The meaning of our numbers” also applies in virtual space.
But, given the prevalence of bots and troll farms, one can never be sure of what the numbers on social media actually signify.
Moreover, an agglomeration of people online is not visible in the way that an assembly of individual citizens is.
True, Trump and other populists often try to discredit bona fide protests by claiming that they are stocked with “crisis actors” or “paid activists.”
But there is no evidence of this; and once protests reach a certain size, such claims are likely to become highly implausible in the eyes of most citizens.
To be sure, elections empirically demonstrate support for particular politicians, parties, and even policies.
But, usually, elections do not register the intensity of that support.
Mobilizing on streets and squares can send an important signal about a constituency’s commitment to a specific cause.
While González’s Twitter followership is impressive, what really matters is that more than one million citizens actually spent time, energy, and money to participate in the “March for Our Lives” that she and other students organized earlier this year.
Joining a rally can be risky in countries like Turkey, where democracy is already under severe threat.
In physical space, one puts one’s body on the line.
And given the power and widespread use of modern surveillance technology, one also makes oneself identifiable to the government.
Yet it is precisely these dangers that make public protest more powerful than, say, anonymous online activism.
Being together in physical space can create a sense of collective capacity.
Talking and acting in concert with others in a visible, mutually reinforcing way is central to the democratic experience.
Thus, in addition to signaling a movement’s goals to the wider public, physical gatherings can have a transformative effect on the participants themselves.
Lastly, in physical space, action can speak as loudly as words in demonstrating new political and social possibilities.
As the social scientist Zeynep Tufekci has shown, demonstrations and occupations today often include pop-up public libraries to celebrate an idea of voluntary cooperation based on equality.
Freedom of assembly is not reducible to free speech or freedom of association.
It is a distinct and powerful form of democratic action.
Those concerned about threats to democracy today should pay heed to the threat against physical gatherings.
The right of assembly deserves more consideration – and more protection – than it has been getting.
Freedom of Religion or Freedom of Speech?
PRINCETON – Last month, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution condemning “defamation of religion” as a human rights violation.
According to the text of the resolution, “Defamation of religion is a serious affront to human dignity” that leads to “a restriction on the freedom of [religions’] adherents.”
The resolution was originally proposed by the 56-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), and was put to the Human Rights Council by Pakistan.
It supports that it was aimed at such things as the derogatory cartoons of the prophet Mohammad published in a Danish newspaper three years ago.
Germany opposed the resolution.
Speaking on behalf of the European Union, a German spokesperson rejected the concept of “defamation of religion” as not valid in a human rights context, because human rights belonged to individuals, not to institutions or religions.
Many non-government organizations, both secular and religious, also opposed the resolution.
Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, said that that body saw the resolution as weakening “the rights of individuals to express their views.”
This seems like a sound argument.
While attempts to stir up hatred against adherents of a religion, or to incite violence against them, may legitimately be suppressed, criticism of religion as such should not be.
The resolution is non-binding, but if nations were to enact laws putting it into effect, there can be no doubt that it would interfere with freedom of expression.
For a start, what counts as “defamation of religion” is contested.
For example, the OIC said in its statement that “Islam is frequently and wrongly associated with human rights violations and terrorism.”
Are those associations wrong?
If the OIC wishes to change many people’s perception that Islam violates human rights, suppressing freedom of speech is hardly the best way to go about it.
The way to change such a perception would be to marshal evidence against it, and to make the case that human rights – including the rights of women – are as well protected in Islamic countries as they are in non-Islamic countries.
To demonstrate that it is wrong to associate Islam with terrorism, the OIC might begin to compile statistics on the religious affiliations of those who engage in terrorism.
By contrast, suppressing the freedom of speech of Islam’s critics merely gives rise to the suspicion that evidence and sound argument cannot show their arguments to be mistaken.
Coincidentally, in the same week that Germany and the World Jewish Congress rejected the idea that defamation of religion is an affront to human dignity, and upheld the right to freedom of expression, Germany’s highest court issued its ruling on a case brought by a Jewish organization, and two Jewish individuals.
The court ruled against the right of the United States-based animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to exhibit posters that juxtapose photographs of victims of the Holocaust with photographs of animals in factory farms and at slaughterhouses.
The posters bear the heading: “To Animals, All People are Nazis” – a line from the Polish-born Jewish writer Isaac Bashevis Singer.
According to the court, Germany’s laws on freedom of speech did not protect PETA’s campaign, because to make “the fate of the victims of the Holocaust appear banal and trivial” was an offense against human dignity.
PETA was, of course, not arguing that Holocaust victims’ fate was banal or trivial.
On the contrary, it was using the Holocaust – which we would all agree was utterly horrific – to suggest, as Isaac Bashevis Singer did, that there are parallels between the way the Nazis treated Jews and the way we treat animals.
The conclusion PETA wants us to reach is that both the Holocaust and the mass confinement and slaughter of animals are horrific.
A free society should be open to discussing such a claim.
Irrespective of the merits of PETA’s campaign, however, those who stood up for free speech at the UN Human Rights Council should be able to see that the fact that some forms of speech cause offense is not sufficient reason to censor them.
If PETA is not allowed to state its case against our abuse of animals in the way that they judge best, because doing so might offend some people, then criticism of religion could also be prohibited on the same grounds.
If, on the other hand, a religion’s adherents have no right to protection against criticism of their religion, then, even in Germany, Holocaust victims and their descendants (I am one) should not be protected against advertising campaigns that, though not intended to incite hatred or violence, may cause them offense.
Free-Market Babies?
LONDON – Does India need a new independence struggle?
The fight this time would not be against British colonialism, but rather against the United Kingdom’s approach to regulating reproductive medicine.
At a time when India is considering a sort of matchmaking service for Western couples seeking to hire Indian surrogate mothers, the UK government has announced the abolition of two leading medical regulatory agencies.
Meanwhile, as these countries move farther down the road to free markets in reproductive medicine, France is debating all of its bioethics laws – and continuing to stand up for a different model, focused on social justice and protection of vulnerable women.
There is an alternative simply to letting the market decide, the French Assembly insists.
At some point, many countries are likely to find themselves embroiled in similar debates and controversies over reproductive rights and obligations.
So it is necessary to clarify what is at stake in how we regulate – or de-regulate – in vitro fertilization (IVF), egg sales, and surrogacy.
It may come as a surprise to American observers, in particular, that the UK approach could be considered “free market.”
After all, the UK forbids outright payment for eggs, whereas in the United States, a highly differentiated market has grown up around “consumer demand.”
And the UK has a national regulatory agency for IVF, whereas the US has a patchwork of state regulations (or a lack thereof).
But the UK’s Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA) might not be around for much longer.
Prime Minister David Cameron’s government announced last July that it intended to abolish the HFEA by 2014, along with the Human Tissue Authority, which deals with non-reproductive tissues.
Already, the HFEA appears to be attempting to preempt the government by softening its regulatory touch.
Last month, the HFEA finished a consultation on increasing the level of “expenses” payable for eggs used in IVF.
European law forbids outright payment for eggs, but the Authority suggests that increasing “expenses” considerably would not constitute an impermissible inducement.
The HFEA is merely “removing disincentives,” not “creating incentives.”
You could be forgiven for missing the difference.
Proponents of the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Regulation Bill 2010, now before the Indian Parliament, employ a similar rhetorical twist.
They say that the bill actually protects surrogate mothers – for example, by limiting the number of pregnancies they can undergo.
But the law would make surrogacy contracts legally binding, requiring the mother to give up the baby even if she changes her mind.
Opponents say that the agencies making the arrangements will be the biggest winners – that the huge profits they reap will dwarf the fees paid by foreign couples to the women bearing their children.
As N.B. Sarojini and Aastha Sharma wrote in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, “The Bill actively promotes medical tourism in India for reproductive purposes.”
France, like most European countries, has a problem with reproductive tourism: a yearly shortage of about 700 egg donors sends some couples over the Pyrenees to Spain, where private IVF clinics pay providers more in “expenses” than the UK allows.
Even so, the draft bill continues to prohibit payment for eggs.
And it’s not just France’s official ethics committee that takes an anti-commodification stance.
The French have recently conducted a series of two-day meetings in several provincial cities.
In Rennes, the panel debating reproductive medical issues supported the policy of not paying for eggs or sperm – not even by the back door of increasing the level of “expenses.”
While the HFEA document calls for ethical concerns to be “balanced” against increasing egg supply, French Assembly members insist that law, morality, and progress are compatible.
They reject the view that ethics is optional, even though some influential professors, like René Frydman, who helped to create the first French IVF baby, have warned that France will fall behind in the science race unless it abandons its principles.
The upper house, the Senate, was much more minded to listen to that view, so the outcome is still uncertain.
France is not a Shangri-La, isolated from global markets or the pressures of international research.
In the words of Emmanuel Hirsch, professor of medical ethics at the University of Paris-XI, “How long can our bioethical standards continue to resist the rise of other logics – particularly financial ones?”
To be sure, French regulation can be heavy-handed – for example, IVF is restricted to heterosexual couples who are married or in long-term relationships.
The official rationale was that eggs and sperm are not commodities, but gifts from a fertile couple to an infertile one.
That is also one reason why the French restricted egg donation to women who had already had at least one baby (though this is being changed).
But the limitation to heterosexual couples was rightly condemned as homophobic by the French public in the consultations.
So the draft bill has been amended to allow lesbian women to receive donated eggs.
(Gay men will still be barred, because they would require a surrogate, and surrogacy remains prohibited.)
That sort of responsiveness to popular sentiment in the legislative process gives the lie to the canard that French regulation is inflexible and hopelessly bureaucratic.
In fact, the free-market “Anglo-Saxon” attitude sounds like nothing so much as the old prejudices about the French that have been around since the novelist Thackeray told English readers: “The Frenchman has after his soup a dish of vegetables, where you have one of meat.
You are a different and superior animal – a French-beating animal.”
Of course, we now know that a diet of bully beef is likely to result in hardening of the arteries, whereas the vegetable-centered Mediterranean diet is much better for human health.
Enough said?
The Case Against Free-Market Capitalism
OXFORD – Free-market capitalism is on trial.
In the United Kingdom, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn accuses neoliberalism of increasing homelessness, throwing children into poverty, and causing wages to fall below subsistence level.
For the defense, Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May cites the immense potential of an open, innovative, free-market economy.
Similar “proceedings” are taking place around the world.
Just a quarter-century ago, the debate about economic systems – state-managed socialism or liberal democracy and capitalism – seemed to have been settled.
With the Soviet Union’s collapse, the case was closed – or so it seemed.
Since then, the rise of China has belied the view that a state-led strategy will always fail, and the global financial crisis exposed the perils of inadequately regulated markets.
In 2017, few of the world’s fastest-growing economies (Ethiopia, Uzbekistan, Nepal, India, Tanzania, Djibouti, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and the Philippines) have free markets.
And many free-market economies are suffering from growth slowdowns and rapidly rising inequality.
Against this background, some politicians are no longer defending free-market capitalism in terms of economic growth or the gains from globalization.
Instead, they focus on individual opportunity.
May, for example, has credited the system with reducing infant mortality, increasing life expectancy, driving down absolute poverty, boosting disposable incomes, expanding access to education, and slashing illiteracy rates.
But these claims aren’t in line with the facts.
Start with maternal mortality.
Much of the world has made great strides in making childbirth safer.
From 1990 to 2015, Albania reduced its maternal deaths per 100,000 live births from 29.3 to 9.6.
China, the poster child for state-led growth, reduced its rate from 114.2 to 17.7.
Meanwhile, the trend in the United States, the paragon of free-market democracy, has gone in the opposite direction, with maternal deaths per 100,000 live births actually rising, from 16.9 in 1990 to 26.4 in 2015.
Equally shocking, the morbidity and mortality of white (non-Hispanic) middle-aged men and women in the US increased between 1999 and 2013.
The claim that free-market policies “slash illiteracy” is also misleading.
In England, some 15% of adults (5.1 million people) are still “functionally illiterate,” meaning that they have literacy levels at or below those expected of an 11-year-old.
Scotland’s most recent survey showed a decline in literacy, with less than half of the country’s 13- and 14-year-olds now performing well in writing.
In fact, if you Google “successful literacy campaign,” the country with astonishing literacy gains that fills your screen is Cuba – hardly a free-market system.
The conservative case, eloquently articulated by May, is that a free-market economy, operating under the right rules and regulations, is the greatest agent of collective human progress ever created.
If that claim is true, the only logical conclusion is that we are doing it wrong.
So what measures are needed to get it right?
The practical solutions on offer seem to be fairly consistent across the political spectrum.
Indeed, for all their furious positioning, the differences between left and right seem to have collapsed in this regard.
In the UK, the first suggestion is to ensure economy-wide investment and growth, which will require government intervention.
Corbyn proposes a National Investment Bank and Transformation Fund to mobilize public investment and create wealth and good jobs.
May, for her part, suggests an industrial strategy to promote “growth across the whole country,” helping to “turn local areas of excellence into national export champions.”
Second, private-sector leadership must change, in order to prevent short-term thinking, tax avoidance, and other forms of opportunism and personal enrichment.
Here, Corbyn focuses on accountability in corporate boardrooms, while May calls for giving workers and shareholders a stronger voice in firms’ decision-making and ensuring that the largest companies have incentives to think long term.
A third corrective is to improve employees’ pay and working conditions.
In Britain, even as the economy has grown, wages have been dropping – by 10% from 2007 to 2014.
Corbyn promises to take action to stop employers from driving down pay and working conditions.
For May, “all work should be fair and decent, with scope for development and fulfillment.”
Both make the case for improving vocational training and technical education.
Fourth, in Britain, the government must address the public-housing crisis.
In the 1950s and 1960s, an average of some 300,000 houses were being built every year; that figure has now dropped to less than half.
Corbyn proposes a review of social housing, rent control, and regeneration for the people.
May has announced the creation of a £2 billion ($2.62 billion) fund for building more council housing.
Finally, Britain needs more effective rules and regulations to ensure that privatized utilities deliver cheaper, more sustainable services.
Corbyn accuses companies of handing out large dividends to shareholders, while infrastructure crumbles, service deteriorates, and companies pay far too little in taxes.
May promises to end “rip-off energy prices.”
The orthodoxy established by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s – to roll back the state, after a decade of profligate and bloated government – is guilty as charged.
A new consensus is emerging that more active and effective government is required to boost growth and expand opportunity.
The jury is still out, however, on whether governments will be given the tools and support they need to rehabilitate the defendant.
The Free-Market Case Against Tax Competition
LONDON – The global race to cut corporate tax rates accelerated in 2018.
According to the OECD’s latest annual review of tax policies across developed economies, the average rate of taxation on corporate profits has fallen from 32.5% in 2000 to below 24% today.
This trend is understandable.
With private-sector investment remaining stubbornly weak, governments are desperate to hold on to whatever piece of the pie they can.
It is better to tax firms lightly and keep them in your jurisdiction than it is to forego that revenue entirely.
After all, other things being equal, firms that are considering building a new factory or other facility will be attracted to countries with a more preferable tax regime.
Likewise, firms facing a higher corporate tax rate in one country may decide to move their operations elsewhere.
Or, rather than transferring personnel and disrupting supply chains, they may find a way to register profits in a lower-tax jurisdiction – typically by moving some head office functions there.
To many economic liberals and traditional conservatives, such “tax competition” is a good thing, because it is assumed that lower taxes will unleash market forces, thereby fueling innovation and growth.
Moreover, advocates of this view don’t think that governments should be taxing business in the first place.
Because a tax on corporate profits reduces the amount of money that a firm has to invest or raise wages, they regard it as a levy on a firm’s employees rather than its owners.
But tax competition should concern economic liberals.
Not only does it strengthen monopolistic trends and erode fair and transparent competition among firms; it also deprives governments of the money needed to sustain the public goods – education, health care, infrastructure, the rule of law – upon which firms rely.
And there is little evidence that the corporate-tax burden actually does fall on employees rather than on capital.
The nonpartisan US Congressional Budget Office and the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy, among others, have demonstrated clearly that over 80% of the impact of corporate taxation falls on shareholders, not workers.
Still, market liberals would argue that corporate taxes “distort” behavior and hamper wealth creation.
But this is simplistic, at best.
For starters, tax competition among jurisdictions is quite different from competition among firms in the market.
When governments try to attract investment with subsidies, tax holidays, special exemptions, and accelerated depreciation schedules, they create distortions that undermine comparative advantage.
Firms will be more focused on wrangling the best financial incentives than on investing in areas with the highest potential productivity gains, and economic dynamism will suffer as a result.
Moreover, tax competition drives market concentration and monopolization, because it tilts the playing field in favor of incumbent multinational corporations, and against smaller potential competitors.
Larger firms have the resources to exploit tax havens for profit-sharing and tax avoidance, whereas small- and medium-sized companies generally do not.
It is little wonder that multinationals have managed to reduce their tax burdens at a much faster rate than smaller firms in recent years.
Tax competition encourages free-riding on public goods, while eroding governments’ capacity to provide such goods.
Like individuals, firms are not wholly responsible for their own success.
They would be nothing without access to a healthy, educated workforce, public infrastructure, and legal systems that enforce contracts, patents, and intellectual property.
In fact, government spending on public goods is probably more economically efficient than lower taxes.
Corporations are already sitting on a sizeable cash surplus; but, rather than invest in workers, equipment, or research and development, they have been buying back their own shares.
In the United States, this practice has accelerated since the enactment of corporate tax cuts in December 2017.
Finally, corporate profits sometimes stem from rent-seeking and other valueless activities that absolutely should be taxed.
There is reason to doubt that a great deal of commercial activity – gambling, selling and advertising alcohol, financial speculation, and so forth – generates any net economic benefits at all.
At best, many corporations are profiting from “distributional” activities that extract existing wealth from the economy.
But even those that do create real value by providing new or improved goods and services still only benefit a subset of society.
In any case, these firms should be taxed to pay for public goods.
Ultimately, governments will have to harmonize elements of their tax systems if they ever want to get ahead of these economically destructive trends.
A deal between the European Union and the US could open the way for a broader international tax regime.
But with transatlantic relations at their lowest point in decades, the prospect of that happening any time soon is remote.
In the meantime, tax competition will continue to erode market competition, while denuding governments of the money needed to invest in the public goods needed to ensure firms’ profitability over the long term.
Is the Press Too Free?
LONDON – The poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia at an Italian restaurant in Salisbury has driven an important story off the front pages of the British press.
Earlier this month, the former actor and comedian John Ford revealed that for 15 years, from 1995 to 2010, he was employed by Rupert Murdoch’s Sunday Times newspaper to hack and blag his way into the private affairs of dozens of prominent people, including then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
Discussing the techniques he used, Ford said: “I did their phones, I did their mobiles, I did their bank accounts, I stole their rubbish.”
Some of the most prominent names in British journalism are likely to be tarnished by this and other revelations of illegality and wrongdoing.
The basic plot goes back to the foundation of the free press with the abolition of licensing in 1695.
To fulfill what has been seen since then as its distinctive purpose – holding power to account – a free press needs information.
We expect a free press to investigate the exercise of power and bring abuses to light.
In this context, one inevitably recalls the exposure of Watergate, which brought down President Richard Nixon in 1974.
But actual scandals are not necessary for the press to do its job.
The very existence of a free press is a constraint on government.
It is not the only one: the rule of law, enforced by an independent judiciary, and competitive elections held at regular intervals are no less important.
Together, they form a three-legged stool: take one, and the other two collapse.
We continue to view the press as our defender against an over-mighty state, despite politicians’ often-craven performance in the face of media pressure.
This is because we have no proper theory of private power.
The liberal argument is both simple and simplistic: the state is dangerous precisely because it is a monopolist.
Because it controls the means of coercion and levies compulsory taxes, its dark doings need to be exposed by fearless investigative journalism.
Newspapers, by contrast, are not monopolists. They lack any power of compulsion, so there is no need to guard against the abuse of press power.
It does not exist.
But while a press monopoly in its pure form does not exist, oligopoly prevails in most countries.
If, as economists claim, the public good emerges from the invisible hand of the market, the market for news is quite visible – and visibly concentrated.
Eight companies own Britain’s 12 national newspapers, and four proprietors account for more than 80% of all copies sold.
In 2013, two men, Murdoch and Lord Rothermere, owned 52% of online and print news publications in the United Kingdom.
Were it not for the success of the press in rendering its own power invisible, we would never rely on self-regulation alone to keep the press honest.
Efforts to bind the British press to a standard of “decent” journalism have been tried – and failed – repeatedly.
There have been six commissions of inquiry in the UK since 1945.
Each one, established after some egregious abuse, has recommended that “steps be taken” to protect privacy; and each time, the government has backed down.
There are two main reasons for this.
First, no politician wants to turn the press against him: Tony Blair’s wooing of Murdoch, owner the Sun, the Times, and the Sunday Times, is legendary, as was its pay-off.
The Murdoch press backed Labour in Blair’s three election victories in 1997, 2001, and 2005.
The other reason is more sinister: newspapers have “dirt” on politicians, which they are willing to use to protect their interests.
In 1989, following pressure from Parliament, the government commissioned David Calcutt to chair a committee to “consider what measures (whether legislative or otherwise) are needed to give further protection to individual privacy from the activities of the press and improve recourse against the press for the individual citizen.”
Calcutt’s key recommendation was to replace the moribund Press Council with a Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was duly created.
In 1993, however, Calcutt described the PCC as “a body set up by the industry, financed by the industry, dominated by the industry, and operating a code of practice devised by the industry and which is over-favorable to the industry.”
He recommended its replacement by a statutory Press Complaints Tribunal.
The government refused to act.
In March 2011, a Joint Committee of Parliament reported that “the current system of self-regulation is broken and needs fixing.”
Because the PCC “was not equipped to deal with systemic and illegal invasions of privacy,” the committee set out proposals for a reformed regulator.
The same year, following criminal prosecutions for telephone hacking which led to the closure of Murdoch’s News of the World, then-Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Lord Justice Brian Leveson to head an inquiry into “the culture, practices and ethics of the press; their relationship with the police; the failure of the current system of regulation; the contacts made, and discussions had, between national newspapers and politicians; why previous warnings about press misconduct were not heeded; and the issue of cross-media ownership.”
Leveson tackled his remit – to make recommendations for a new, more effective way of regulating the press – with “one simple question: who guards the guardians?”
The first part of the Leveson Report, published in 2012, recommended an industry regulator whose independence from the newspapers and government alike was to be assured by a Press Recognition Panel, set up under a Royal Charter.
To preempt what they called “state control,” the newspaper proprietors set up an Independent Press Standards Organization (IPSO), accountable to no one but itself.
True to previous form, the government then gave up, overruling the opinion of Leveson himself that further inquiry was needed to establish the “extent of unlawful or improper conduct by newspapers, including corrupt payments to the police.”
Indeed, Leveson doubted whether the IPSO is sufficiently different from its predecessor, the PCC, to have resulted in any “real difference in behavior” at all.
Although some British press outlets are uniquely vicious, striking the right balance between the public’s need to know and individuals’ right to privacy is a general problem, and must be continually addressed in the light of changing technology and practices.
The media are still needed to protect us against abuses of state power; but we need the state to protect us from abuses of media power.
Fighting Anti-Semitism Requires Free Speech
PARIS – The populist surge across the West has brought with it, no surprise, a rising tide of anti-Semitism.
In the United Kingdom, the Labour party is bedeviled by charges that its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tolerates anti-Semitic comments among his hard-left supporters.
In Hungary, a key component of recently re-elected Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s campaign was a barely disguised anti-Semitic attack against the philanthropist George Soros.
In France, anti-Semitism comes from two directions: the far-right National Front and certain sections of the country’s large Muslim community.
And the means by which France is combating its anti-Semitic outbursts could well prove to be a useful model for other countries to follow.
For starters, the French social contract is based on the peaceful coexistence of different religions, none of which can be sponsored by the state.
At the same time, the rule of law necessarily takes priority over any specific religious precept.
So, for example, regardless of whether there are imams who recommend or tolerate female circumcision, the ritual cutting of girls’ genitals is a crime, punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
Likewise, polygamy is illegal in France.
So, even if an immigrant comes from a country where such practices are permitted, French courts will not recognize his marriage to more than one wife. Nor will they recognize any challenges to gender equality, even those based on religious beliefs.
Under France’s constitutional system of secularism (laïcité), religion is confined to the personal and private sphere.
To borrow from the French poet Louis Aragon, this ensures mutual respect between those who believe in the hereafter and those who do not (“Celui qui croyait au Ciel / Celui qui n’y croyait pas”).
Thus, in many French schools, teachers avoid mentioning religion whenever possible.
These fundamental principles have guaranteed peaceful religious coexistence since the end of World War II, despite the trauma of the war years and the large influx of Muslims that followed the Algerian War.
Sadly, these principles are now being threatened, not so much by the National Front and other populists (whose leaders have been prosecuted for anti-Semitic musings and Holocaust denial), but by the growing influence of radical and hardline interpretations of Islam.
This influence is felt not just in particular communities, but throughout French political and civil society, owing to the rise of advocacy and activist organizations with obscure origins and funding, some of which promote the establishment of Sharia law.
For those wielding this influence, the goal is to create a culture of victimization among French young people of Arab origin.
The hope is that they will embrace the Palestinian cause and, in the most extreme cases, exact revenge on Israelis or on Jews in France.
It is little wonder, then, that anti-Semitic incidents in France have dramatically increased in recent years, leading French President Emmanuel Macron to declare that anti-Zionism is “a reinvented form of anti-Semitism.”
The most recent victim of anti-Semitic violence was Mireille Knoll, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor who was murdered on March 23, allegedly by a young neighbor she had often welcomed into her home.
According to French investigators, the man reportedly shouted “Allahu Akbar” while viciously killing her.
After the murder, thousands of people took to the streets in Paris to mourn and express their anger.
For most of those marching, it was yet another sad reminder of the 2012 attack on a Jewish school in Toulouse, the 2015 massacres at the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and at a kosher grocery, and many other similar incidents.
Meanwhile, those stoking anger over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have launched a campaign of intimidation against anyone who would dare to identify the sources of today’s anti-Semitism.
Consider the case of Georges Bensoussan, a highly regarded historian and author of the 2012 book Jews in Arab Countries.
In a 2015 radio appearance, Bensoussan referred to a 2014 survey which found that French Muslims were 2-3 times more likely to harbor anti-Jewish sentiments than French people generally, and surmised that such views are learned at home.
Soon thereafter, the Collective Against Islamophobia in France and the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism filed separate legal complaints against Bensoussan, accusing him of inciting racial hatred.
Bensoussan was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing in March 2017, but the entire episode was reminiscent of the 2007 prosecution of Charlie Hebdo cartoonists for their depiction of the Prophet Muhammad.
In these and many other cases, intellectuals and artists who have long fought against racism have found themselves accused of it.
So far, the formal legal challenges brought against critics of Islam have failed, because French courts and tribunals have seen through the false accusations of racism.
But the strategy of intimidation could always score a victory in the future.
To ensure that no voice is wrongly silenced, French democratic institutions must continue to defend free speech, the most precious of all human rights – and the one most necessary to overcome hate in all its many guises.
Free Speech, Muhammad, and the Holocaust
The timing of Austria’s conviction and imprisonment of David Irving for denying the Holocaust could not have been worse.
Coming after the deaths of at least 30 people in Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Libya, Nigeria, and other Islamic countries during protests against cartoons ridiculing Muhammad, the Irving verdict makes a mockery of the claim that in democratic countries, freedom of expression is a basic right.
We cannot consistently hold that cartoonists have a right to mock religious figures but that it should be a criminal offense to deny the existence of the Holocaust.
I believe that we should stand behind freedom of speech. And that means that David Irving should be freed.
Before you accuse me of failing to understand the sensitivities of victims of the Holocaust, or the nature of Austrian anti-Semitism, I should say that I am the son of Austrian Jews.
My parents escaped Austria in time, but my grandparents did not.
All four of my grandparents were deported to ghettos in Poland and Czechoslovakia.
Two of them were sent to Lodz, in Poland, and then probably murdered with carbon monoxide at the extermination camp at Chelmno.
One fell ill and died in the overcrowded and underfed ghetto at Theresienstadt.
My maternal grandmother was the only survivor.
So I have no sympathy for David Irving’s absurd denial of the Holocaust – which he now claims was a mistake.
I support efforts to prevent any return to Nazism in Austria or anywhere else.
But how is the cause of truth served by prohibiting Holocaust denial?
If there are still people crazy enough to deny that the Holocaust occurred, will they be persuaded by imprisoning people who express that view?
On the contrary, they will be more likely to think that people are being imprisoned for expressing views cannot be refuted by evidence and argument alone.
In his classic defense of freedom of speech in, On Liberty, John Stuart Mill wrote that if a view is not “fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed,” it will become “a dead dogma, not a living truth.”
The existence of the Holocaust should remain a living truth, and those who are skeptical about the enormity of the Nazi atrocities should be confronted with the evidence for it.
In the aftermath of World War II, when the Austrian republic was struggling to establish itself as a democracy, it was reasonable, as a temporary emergency measure, for Austrian democrats to suppress Nazi ideas and propaganda.
But that danger is long past.
Austria is a democracy and a member of the European Union.
Despite the occasional resurgence of anti-immigrant and even racist views – an occurrence that is, lamentably, not limited to countries with a fascist past − there is no longer a serious threat of any return to Nazism in Austria.
By contrast, freedom of speech is essential to democratic regimes, and it must include the freedom to say what everyone else believes to be false, and even what many people find offensive.
We must be free to deny the existence of God, and to criticize the teachings of Jesus, Moses, Muhammad, and Buddha, as reported in texts that millions of people regard as sacred.
Without that freedom, human progress will always run up against a basic roadblock.
Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of expression.
This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.”
To be consistent with that clear statement – and without the vague qualifications of Article 11, which threaten to render it meaningless – Austria should repeal its law against Holocaust denial.
Other European nations with similar laws – for example, Germany, France, Italy, and Poland – should do the same, while maintaining or strengthening their efforts to inform their citizens about the reality of the Holocaust and why the racist ideology that led to it should be rejected.
Laws against incitement to racial, religious, or ethnic hatred, in circumstances where that incitement is intended to – or can reasonably be foreseen to – lead to violence or other criminal acts, are different, and are compatible with maintaining freedom to express any views at all.
Only when David Irving has been freed will it be possible for Europeans to turn to the Islamic protesters and say: “We apply the principle of freedom of expression even-handedly, whether it offends Moslems, Christians, Jews, or anyone else.”
Free Speech on Trial
Not so long ago, there was jubilation that the free world and its values had prevailed in the Cold War.
When the Communist empire collapsed, some even announced that the victory of liberty and democracy implied the “end of history.”
But history never bowed out; at most, it only took a decade-long intermission, with its next act heralded by the terrorist attacks in the United States in September 2001.
And here the plot has thickened.
Instead of rejoicing in the liberal order, those of us who have the pleasure of living under it have had to struggle to keep it intact and strong.
Since 9/11, more and more freedoms are being restricted in the name of defending liberty.
New visa requirements and other obstacles to travel, more intimate data collected by governments, and the presence of video cameras everywhere – at once benign and intrusive – remind one more of George Orwell’s Big Brother than of John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty.
Britain is not the only country where ancient rights of habeas corpus, of the inviolability of the person, are to be restricted by new legislation that, for example, extends the permissible length of detention without charge.
Now, even the fundamental right of a liberal order, free speech, is under pressure.
Some restrictions are understandable legacies of the past, but must nevertheless be re-examined.
In Austria, the historian David Irving was arrested recently because he has denied that the Holocaust happened.
In the prison library, however, Irving found two of the books he had written that had led to his arrest!
In Berlin, there is much concern about the possible desecration of the Holocaust Memorial, although its author, the American architect Peter Eisenmann, takes a relaxed view of what is said and done about his creation.
Other restrictions of free speech have more recent triggers.
In the Netherlands, the shock that arose over the killing of the film maker Theo van Gogh runs deep and has led to demands for legislation against hate speech.
In Britain, proposed legislation concerning incitement to religious hatred and terrorism has led to emotional parliamentary debates – and to doubts about the liberal credentials of Tony Blair’s government.
Can such demands for restricting free speech ever be legitimate?
The first and principled answer must surely be no.
All freedoms can be abused by liberty’s enemies, but in the case of speech, the risk posed by restricting freedom is surely greater.
Moreover, the benefits of tolerating free speech outweigh the harm of abusing it.
Indeed, the Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen has demonstrated that free speech even helps mitigate seemingly natural catastrophes like famines, because it reveals the ways in which a few haves exploit the many have-nots.
As the watchdog organization Transparency International reminds us, corruption exposed is in many cases corruption prevented.
These practical consequences are above and beyond the liberating effect of allowing the “marketplace of ideas,” rather than state authorities, to judge people’s expressed views.
Are there really no exceptions to this rule?
The classic example comes to mind of the man who shouts “Fire!” in a crowded theatre.
In the resulting panic, people may be hurt or even killed.
Nowadays, we worry about incitement ­– using free speech to provoke violence.
I do not know how many Islamic leaders preach murder and mayhem in mosques and help recruit suicide bombers from among their congregants; but even if it is only a handful, they pose a question that must be answered.
That answer must be given carefully.
For free societies to flourish, the boundaries of free speech should always be widened rather than narrowed.
In my view, Holocaust denial should not be outlawed, in contrast to the demand for all, or any, Jews to be killed.
Similarly, attacks against the West in mosques, however vicious, should not be banned, in contrast to open encouragement to join suicide death squads.
What about the mere praise of “martyrs” who have died while murdering others?
The boundary between implicit and explicit incitement is not easily drawn, but, again, it should be wider rather than narrower.
Free speech is immensely precious, and so is the dignity and integrity of humans.
Both require active and alert citizens who engage what they do not like rather than calling for the state to clamp down on it.
Direct incitement to violence is regarded – as it should be ­– as an unacceptable abuse of free speech; but much that is disagreeable about the David Irving’s and the hate preachers does not fall into this category.
Their rants should be rejected with argument, not with police and prisons.
Free Tilly – and all Circus Animals
MELBOURNE – Last month, at the Sea World amusement park in Florida, a whale grabbed a trainer, Dawn Brancheau, pulled her underwater, and thrashed about with her.
By the time rescuers arrived, Brancheau was dead.
The death of the trainer is a tragedy, and one can only have sympathy for her family.
But the incident raises broader questions: was the attack deliberate?
Did the whale, an orca named Tilikum and nicknamed Tilly, act out of stress at being held captive in a sterile concrete tank?
Was he tired of being forced to perform to amuse the crowds?
Is it right to keep such large animals in close confinement?
Tilly had been involved in two previous human deaths.
In one episode, a trainer fell into the pool and Tilly and two other whales drowned him.
In another, a man who appears to have gotten into the enclosure at night, when Sea World was closed, was found dead in the pool with Tilly.
An autopsy showed that he had a bite mark.
One of Tilly’s offspring, sold to an amusement park in Spain, has also killed a trainer, as have orcas in other parks.
Richard Ellis, a marine conservationist at the American Museum of Natural History, believes that orcas are smart and would not do such a thing purely on impulse.
“This was premeditated,” he told The Associated Press.
We will never know exactly what was going on in Tilly’s mind, but we do know that he has been in captivity since he was about two years old – he was captured off the coast of Iceland in 1983.
Orcas are social mammals, and he would have been living with his mother and other relatives in a pod.
It is reasonable to suppose that the sudden separation was traumatic for Tilly.
Moreover, the degree of confinement in an aquarium is extreme, for no tank, no matter how large, can come close to meeting the needs of animals who spend their lives in social groups swimming long distances in the ocean.
Joyce Tischler, of the Animal Legal Defense Fund, described keeping a six-ton orca in Sea World’s tanks as akin to keeping a human in a bathtub for his entire life.
David Phillips, director of the International Marine Mammal Project for the Earth Island Institute, which led the efforts to rehabilitate the orca Keiko – made famous by the movie Free Willy – said “Orcas deserve a better fate than living in cramped pools.”
But if we are pointing the finger at Sea World for what it does to its captive animals, we should also look more broadly at the way we confine performing animals.
In most countries, it is possible to visit zoos and see bored animals pacing back and forth in cages, with nothing to do but wait for the next meal.
Circuses are even worse places for animals.
Their living conditions are deplorable, especially in traveling circuses where cages have to be small so that they can go on the road.
Training animals to perform tricks often involves starvation and cruelty.
Undercover investigations have repeatedly shown animals being beaten and given electric shocks.
Several countries – among them Austria, Costa Rica, Denmark, Finland, India, Israel, and Sweden – ban or severely restrict the use of wild animals in circuses.
In Brazil, a movement to ban wild animals from circuses started after hungry lions managed to grab and devour a small boy.
Several major cities and many local governments around the world do not permit circuses with wild animals.
Last year, Bolivia became the first country to ban all animals, wild or domestic, from circuses.
That decision followed an undercover investigation by Animal Defenders International, which exposed shocking abuse of circus animals.
Now the British government is holding a public online consultation on the use of animals in circuses.
Many hope it will be a first step towards a ban.
Attempts to defend amusement parks and circuses on the grounds that they “educate” people about animals should not be taken seriously.
Such enterprises are part of the commercial entertainment industry.
The most important lesson they teach impressionable young minds is that it is acceptable to keep animals in captivity for human amusement.
That is the opposite of the ethical attitude to animals that we should be seeking to impart to children.
Nor should we be swayed by the argument that circuses provide employment.
The human slave trade also provided employment, but that was no argument for perpetuating it.
In any case, in many countries that have restrictions or bans on circuses with animals, human-only circuses have flourished.
There is no excuse for keeping wild animals in amusement parks or circuses.
Until our governments take action, we should avoid supporting places where captive wild animals perform for our amusement.
If the public will not pay to see them, the businesses that profit from keeping animals captive will not be able to continue.
When our children ask us to take them to the circus, we should find out if the circus uses wild animals.
If it does, we should explain to our children why we will not take them there, and offer to take them to a circus that does not.
Free Trade Ad Nauseam
NEW YORK – So much has been written, by so many, against the muddled ideas that have now overwhelmed good sense on trade policy in the United States government that one wonders whether there is anything left to say.
Yet it is worth recalling what Pierre-Joseph Proudhon reportedly told the Russian intellectual Alexander Herzen: “And do you imagine that once a thing has been said, it is enough?....It has to be dinned into people, it has to be repeated over and over again.”
What we need now is a primer on the major misconceptions in the hope that, unlike Gresham’s Law, which says that bad money drives out good money, good economics will drive out bad economics.
Four, in particular need to be corrected.
The first misconception is that exports create jobs, while imports do not – a fallacy that the great trade economist Harry Johnson traced to mercantilism, and which the US has resurrected.
In fact, in a world where parts and components come from everywhere, interference with imports imperils competitiveness.
The success of parcel-delivery companies, for example, depends on imports, which must be brought from the borders inland, as well as on exports.
Second, the credo “Trade, not aid” has given way to the mistaken belief that trade matters less than foreign assistance.
The labor constituency, ever fearful of import competition, has undermined trade policy.
It has also shifted aid policy in directions that assign priority to areas where the returns to US efforts are relatively minuscule.
Thus, the US State Department has ceased being an advocate of multilateral trade liberalization, despite decades of massive gains from the removal of trade barriers.
Instead, its aid arm, the US Agency for International Development, has now retreated into low-yield programs conceived as randomized experiments.
That technique impresses Bill Gates, and the new USAID administrator, Rajiv Shah, has experience with it.
But, even if all such programs succeeded, their benefits would not add up to a fraction of the documented gains that have accrued from trade and other macro-level policies in which the US has lost interest.
Third, many believe that manufactures deserve preferential support.
This is practically the mantra of US President Barack Obama’s administration, and it has cost him the support not only of much of the economics profession, but also of Christina Romer, who chaired his Council of Economic Advisers.
In a recent newspaper commentary, she refuted virtually all of the arguments advanced by manufacturing lobbyists for special treatment.
Add to the critiques that of Nobel laureate Robert Solow, a staunch supporter of Obama’s Democratic Party.
He agrees that there are activities that yield higher social returns than private returns.
The problem, he notes, is that neither he nor anyone else can possibly know which ones they are, whereas the lobbyists claim that they know this precisely.
Proponents of a “manufacturing first” policy argue that “clusters” of businesses are more productive than individual businesses are.
But big clustering effects are hard to find.
The economists Glenn Ellison and Edward Glaeser have found that clustering is only marginally greater than if businesses are allocated randomly.
Besides, it is hard not to accept that, in the economist Frances Cairncross’s famous words, we are increasingly seeing the “death of distance.”
Finally, the financial sector has come to be viewed as the bane of morality.
In a world of financial fraud and insider trading, it is easy enough to believe this, and to accept that the financial sector must be taxed.
But morality cuts across sectors.
There are plenty of honest people in all walks of life, and crooks as well.
The quasi-Marxist view that our morality stems from our economic position overlooks the moralizing role of family, religion, culture, and art.
Given these misconceptions, protectionism has re-emerged as a formidable foe.
In 1999, when the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization erupted into bomb threats and mayhem, I asked then-Director-General Mike Moore whether we ought not to be prepared to die for the great cause of free trade.
I should have said: we ought at least to be prepared to live for it.
Between old and new muddle, and the certain prospect that the demolition of each bad idea merely allows others to take root and grow in its place, the task of the free trader is never finished.
Free-Trade Blinders
CAMBRIDGE – I was recently invited by two Harvard colleagues to make a guest appearance in their course on globalization.
“I have to tell you,” one of them warned me beforehand, “this is a pretty pro-globalization crowd.”
In the very first meeting, he had asked the students how many of them preferred free trade to import restrictions; the response was more than 90%.
And this was before the students had been instructed in the wonders of comparative advantage!
We know that when the same question is asked in real surveys with representative samples – not just Harvard students – the outcome is quite different.
In the United States, respondents favor trade restrictions by a two-to-one margin.
But the Harvard students’ response was not entirely surprising.
Highly skilled and better-educated respondents tend to be considerably more pro-free trade than blue-collar workers are.
Perhaps the Harvard students were simply voting with their own (future) wallets in mind.
Or maybe they did not understand how trade really works.
After all, when I met with them, I posed the same question in a different guise, emphasizing the likely distributional effects of trade.
This time, the free-trade consensus evaporated – even more rapidly than I had anticipated.
I began the class by asking students whether they would approve of my carrying out a particular magic experiment.
I picked two volunteers, Nicholas and John, and told them that I was capable of making $200 disappear from Nicholas’s bank account – poof! – while adding $300 to John’s.amp#160; This feat of social engineering would leave the class as a whole better off by $100.
Would they allow me to carry out this magic trick?
Those who voted affirmatively were only a tiny minority. Many were uncertain.
Even more opposed the change.
Clearly the students were uncomfortable about condoning a significant redistribution of income, even if the economic pie grew as a result.
How is it possible, I asked, that almost all of them had instinctively favored free trade, which entails a similar – in fact, most likely greater – redistribution from losers to winners?
They appeared taken aback.
Let’s assume, I said next, that Nicholas and John own two small firms that compete with each other.
Suppose that John got richer by $300 because he worked harder, saved and invested more, and created better products, driving Nicholas out of business and causing him a loss of $200.
How many of the students now approved of the change?
This time a vast majority did – in fact, everyone except Nicholas approved!
I posed other hypotheticals, now directly related to international trade.
Suppose John had driven Nicholas out of business by importing higher-quality inputs from Germany?
By outsourcing to China, where labor rights are not well protected?
By hiring child workers in Indonesia?
Support for the proposed change dropped with each one of these alternatives.
But what about technological innovation, which, like trade, often leaves some people worse off.
Here, few students would condone blocking technological progress.
Banning the light bulb because candle makers would lose their jobs strikes almost everyone as a silly idea.
So the students were not necessarily against redistribution. They were against certain kinds of redistribution.
Like most of us, they care about procedural fairness.
To pass judgment on redistributive outcomes, we need to know about the circumstances that cause them.
We do not begrudge Bill Gates or Warren Buffett their billions, even if some of their rivals have suffered along the way, presumably because they and their competitors operate according to the same ground rules and face pretty much the same opportunities and obstacles.
We would think differently if Gates and Buffett had enriched themselves not through perspiration and inspiration, but by cheating, breaking labor laws, ravaging the environment, or taking advantage of government subsidies abroad.
If we do not condone redistribution that violates widely shared moral codes at home, why should we accept it just because it involves transactions across political borders?
Similarly, when we expect redistributive effects to even out in the long run, so that everyone eventually comes out ahead, we are more likely to overlook reshufflings of income.
That is a key reason why we believe that technological progress should run its course, despite its short-run destructive effects on some.
When, on the other hand, the forces of trade repeatedly hit the same people – less educated, blue-collar workers – we may feel less sanguine about globalization.
Too many economists are tone-deaf to such distinctions.
They are prone to attribute concerns about globalization to crass protectionist motives or ignorance, even when there are genuine ethical issues at stake.
By ignoring the fact that international trade sometimes – certainly not always – involves redistributive outcomes that we would consider problematic at home, they fail to engage the public debate properly.
They also miss the opportunity to mount a more robust defense of trade when ethical concerns are less warranted.
While globalization occasionally raises difficult questions about the legitimacy of its redistributive effects, we should not respond automatically by restricting trade.
There are many difficult trade-offs to consider, including the consequences for others around the world who may be made significantly poorer than those hurt at home.
But democracies owe themselves a proper debate, so that they make such choices consciously and deliberately.
Fetishizing globalization simply because it expands the economic pie is the surest way to delegitimize it in the long run.
Free Trade Breakdown
COPENHAGEN – Last month, the Doha negotiations, promising freer trade, broke down, ostensibly over a small technicality in safeguard rules.
In reality, the talks collapsed because nobody – not Europe, not the United States, China, India, or the other main developing countries – was willing to take the political short-term hit by offending inefficient farmers and coddled domestic industries in order to create greater long-term benefits for virtually everyone.
And they broke down because we really don’t care.
After a few exasperated editorials, the world has pretty much dropped the subject and gone back to its usual concerns.
This is foolish.
Establishing significantly freer trade would help the world combat almost all of its biggest problems.
For an astonishingly low cost, we could improve education and health conditions, make the poorest people richer, and help everybody become better able to tackle the future.
We have known for centuries that free trade almost always benefits both parties.
The economist David Ricardo pointed out in 1817 that both Great Britain and Portugal would benefit if they exploited their comparative advantages.
Portugal could produce wine cheaply, whereas Great Britain could produce cloth much more cheaply than wine.
By selling cloth and buying wine, Great Britain obtains more of both, as does Portugal.
The same holds true today, when countries, doing what they do best, produce more and exchange it for more of all other goods.
Yet today, with international trade talks stalled and protectionist rhetoric rising, we are instead moving toward building bigger trade barriers.
These barriers are supported by deep-pocketed, self-serving corporations and lobby groups, and defended by politicians who are scared that the redistribution of jobs, income, and wealth resulting from freer trade will reduce their chances of remaining in power.
When the Doha trade round was launched shortly after September 11, 2001, there was plenty of international goodwill.
But a recent Financial Times/Harris poll in the US, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain found people nearly three times more likely to say that globalization is negative than positive.
Recently, the Copenhagen Consensus project gathered some of the world’s leading economists to decide how to do the most good for the planet in a world of finite resources.
The panel – including five Nobel laureates – found that one of the single best actions the planet could take would be completing the Doha negotiations.
They based their conclusions on new research for the Copenhagen Consensus project by Australian economist Kym Anderson.
Anderson showed that if developing countries cut their tariffs by the same proportion as high-income countries, and services and investment were also liberalized, the annual global gains could climb to $120 billion, with $17 billion going to the world's poorest countries by 2015.
This is a respectable sum, and certainly a benefit that the international community should try to achieve.
But what we often fail to realize is that the story only starts here.
As economies open up, as countries do what they do best, competition and innovation drive up rates of growth.
More competition means that previously sheltered companies must shape up and become more productive, innovating simply to survive.
Having more open economies allows more trade in innovation, so that new companies can almost instantly use smart ideas from around the globe.
Instead of every closed market having to re-invent the wheel, once is enough to get everyone’s economy going.
This means that over time, the advantage of moving toward freer trade grows dramatically bigger: the $120 billion benefit in 2015 grows to many trillions of dollars of annual benefits by the end of the century.
And the benefits would increasingly accrue to the developing world, which would achieve the biggest boosts to growth rates.
We have seen three very visible cases of such growth boosts in three different decades.
South Korea liberalized trade in 1965, Chile in 1974, and India in 1991; all saw annual growth rates increase by several percentage points thereafter.
If we recast these benefits as annual installments, a realistic Doha outcome could increase global income by more than $3 trillion every year throughout this century.
And about $2.5 trillion annually would go to today’s developing countries every year, or $500 a year on average for each individual in the third world, almost half of whom now survive on less than $2 a day.
There would, of course, be costs.
Freer trade would force some industries to downsize or close, although more industries would expand, and for some people and communities, the transition would be difficult.
Yet the overall benefits of a successful Doha Round would likely be hundreds of times greater than these costs.
It is interesting to contrast global skepticism about free trade with support for expensive, inefficient methods to combat global warming.
Many argue that we should act, even if such action will have no benefit for the next decades, because it will help lessen the impact of global warming by the century’s end.
But free trade also promises few benefits now and huge benefits in the future.
Moreover, if we could stop global warming (which we can’t), the benefit for future generations would be one-tenth or less of the benefit of freer trade (which we certainly can achieve).
Still, there are few celebrity campaigners calling on politicians to sort out the Doha Round.
Global fear about free trade leaves the planet at risk of missing out on the extraordinary benefits that it offers.
Free trade is good not only for big corporations, or for job growth.
It is simply good.
Free Trade, Free Labor, Free Growth
ADELAIDE – Protectionist sentiment and fear of globalization are on the rise.
In the United States, presidential candidates appeal to anxious voters by blaming the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) for the erosion of the country’s manufacturing base.
Liberal trade initiatives have run into trouble in Congress, while new trade barriers have been mooted for products flooding in from China.
Things are no better in Europe.
France has dealt the Doha round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations a blow by rejecting the outline deal on agriculture.
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso believes that protectionist pressures are increasing.
When the Doha trade round was launched shortly after September 11, 2001, there was plenty of international goodwill.
But disenchantment with globalization – and, in some regions, fear of immigration– has since set in.
A recent Financial Times/Harris poll in the US, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain found people nearly three times more likely to say that globalization is negative than positive.
Free trade would lead to an overwhelming boost to welfare everywhere, but especially in the developing world.
Grasping these benefits is potentially one of this generation’s greatest challenges.
Increased negative sentiment could have the worst possible result: not just Doha’s failure, but also the raising of trade and immigration barriers.
These barriers remain largely because further liberalization would redistribute jobs, income, and wealth in ways that governments fear would reduce their chances of remaining in power – and their own wealth in countries where corruption is rife.
The greatest hope is thus getting the Doha round back on track.
But there is a big difference between a low-quality result and one that is more comprehensive.
If little more is achieved than phasing out farm export subsidies and a modest reduction in agricultural domestic support, our analysis shows that developing countries as a group would gain nothing, while high-income countries would gain just US$18 billion per year by 2015.
By contrast, if developing countries cut their tariffs by the same proportion as high-income countries, and services and investment were also liberalized, the global annual gains could climb as high as US$120 billion, with US$17 billion going to the world’s poorest countries. Moreover, the long-term impact of free trade is huge.
Recast as after calculating the net present value of the stream of future benefits, a realistic Doha outcome could increase global income by more than $3000 billion per year, $2500 billion of which would go to the developing world.
In addition, the experiences of successful reformers like Korea, China, India, and Chile suggest that trade liberalization immediately boosts annual economic growth rates by several percentage points for many years.
Eliminating subsidies and trade barriers would mean that resources could be used more efficiently, so there would be more scope to reduce inequality and poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, malnutrition, and disease.
There would, of course, be costs.
Firms and workers would need to adjust as reform forces some industries to downsize or close and allows others to expand.
In addition, there are social costs to consider.
Yet the benefits of a successful Doha round are between 45 and 440 times higher than these costs.
This is clearly an extremely sound investment.
An “alternative” to Doha, whereby other high-income countries would follow the European Union’s offer of duty-free access to products from Least-Developed Countries (LDCs) and African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) small countries, would involve only a tiny fraction of global gains from trade reform.
Moreover, it may well hurt other poor countries – thereby worsening inequality – by encouraging resources to be allocated to activities that become uncompetitive following the next World Trade Organization agreement.
If trade liberalization in goods and services proves too politically difficult to achieve in this decade, the benefits of liberalizing international labor flows is worth contemplating – not least because otherwise illegal migration is likely to increase.
Historical experience shows that migration is the fastest way to bring about a convergence in living standards.
We examined the costs and benefits of an expansion in international migration over a 25-year period, amounting to a 3% boost in host countries’ labor forces by 2025.
The costs would include one-off expenses to migrants: transport, obtaining visas and permits, and finding housing, schooling, and employment, as well as the emotional cost of separation from family.
There are also one-off costs to host-country governments, such as processing applications and providing initial help with housing and welfare.
These costs have been estimated at between $14,000 and $42,000 per worker and family (shared equally by migrants and host governments).
The global net benefit of the increased flow of migrants for 25 years is between $13 trillion and $39 trillion – close to the median estimated gains from the Doha round.
The benefits are between 28 and 220 times higher than the costs.
Even if freeing up immigration multilaterally seems too difficult to include as part of a Doha round agreement, individual countries could do so unilaterally with the stroke of a pen.
The economic logic is compelling: removing trade and migration barriers would be an exceptionally wise investment.
The real hurdle is getting this message across to politicians and voters.
The Real Problem with Free Trade
NEW DELHI – For most critics of globalization, trade is the villain, responsible for deepening inequality and rising economic insecurity among workers.
This is the logic driving support for US President Donald Trump’s escalating tariffs.
Why, then, does the message resonate far beyond the United States, and even the advanced economies, to include workers in many of the developing countries that are typically portrayed as globalization’s main beneficiaries?
Free trade is hardly the only – or even primary – source of inequality and insecurity worldwide.
Surprisingly, one enduring problem that provokes far less popular backlash is that finance continues to dominate the world economy, generating substantial instability and mounting risks like those that led to the 2008 global financial crisis.
Moreover, some countries continue to pursue fiscal austerity, instead of consolidating their budgets by, say, addressing large-scale tax avoidance and evasion by major companies and wealthy individuals.
And labor-saving innovations continue to be developed and deployed, producing “technological unemployment” among some groups.
Some argue that free trade is being demonized simply because people do not understand what is in their own best interest.
But that is both patronizing and simplistic.
Even if free trade is ultimately broadly beneficial, the fact remains that as trade has become freer, inequality has worsened.
One major reason for this is that current global rules have enabled a few large firms to capture an ever-larger share of the value-added from trade.
Specifically, the proliferation of global value chains has enabled powerful multinational firms to control the design, production, and distribution of traded goods and services, even as various segments are outsourced to smaller firms far from final markets.
These firms often benefit from intellectual-property monopolies, reinforced by free-trade agreements designed to strengthen corporate power.
These enable them to collect massive economic rents, especially at the pre-production (including design) and post-production (marketing and branding) stages, where the most value-added and profit is generated.
Meanwhile, increasingly intense competition in the production phase drives down prices, so that the actual producers, whether employers or workers, receive diminishing shares of the value pie.
The upshot of this system is that many developing countries that should have benefited from the globalization of value chains have remained confined to low-productivity activities that yield only limited economic value and do not even foster wider technological upgrading.
The forthcoming Trade and Development Report 2018 by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) captures how top firms have steadily increased their share of total exports, and now dominate global trade.
Ironically, this trend has intensified since the 2008 global financial crisis, which cast a spotlight on the disproportionate market power of the few and the outsize gains going to the top 1% of the income distribution.
UNCTAD’s research also shows that, for both developed and developing countries, integration into global value chains correlates with declining shares of domestic value-added in exports.
The share of actual production in domestic value-added has also declined, as has the share of the remaining value-added accrued by labor.
One potential driver of the latter trend is that, by drastically enlarging the global labor supply, the economic integration of countries with large populations like China and India has increased the bargaining power of capital relative to labor.
The only significant exception to these trends is China, which has designed industrial policies specifically to increase the share of domestic value-added and to improve workers’ conditions.
Ironically, it is these measures, which have helped offset some of the negative effects of free trade, that Trump has condemned in his pursuit of policies that will do little to protect workers.
But the implications of allowing a few global corporations to wield such vast market power extend further.
For one thing, such concentrated economic power makes it more difficult for countries to industrialize, because local companies cannot expect to compete with established multinationals.
For another, it prevents developing countries from reaping the full benefits of rising commodity prices, though they gain no protection from price downturns.
The ability of large corporations to underprice natural resources also encourages excessive extraction, pollution, and environmental degradation – outcomes that they disingenuously present as the “price of development.”
Consumers also suffer.
Yes, major multinationals can offer low prices.
But their massive market power leaves consumers at their mercy in every sphere, from manufacturing to financial services to digital technologies.
The more power these companies have, the more they can accrue, as they use their influence to shape regulatory systems, economic policies, and even tax regimes.
The result is a weakened state that serves the interests of the few, rather than protecting the many.
Those who claim that redistribution can adequately address this problem must address the fact that the “losers” of free trade have so far received little, if any, compensation.
Globalization’s detractors are right that free trade has created serious imbalances.
But a trade war completely misses the point.
The problem is not that free trade has led to too much global competition, but rather that it has enabled a few companies to secure monopolies or near-monopolies. This has given rise to massive inequalities, blatant rent-seeking, and predatory behavior.
Only by addressing these trends can the benefits of trade be increased and equitably shared.
Free Trade or Freebies for the Powerful?
As the United States Congress begins to debate the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), a titanic struggle between the forces of free trade and protectionism promises to unfold.
But that debate should not be allowed to mask the truth behind this treaty: the DR-CAFTA is more a pleading of special interests than a free-trade deal.
It manages simultaneously to fleece the people of six poor countries and to put US workers in harm’s way.
To be sure, expanded trade holds great promise for promoting development and democracy.
But the trade rules inscribed in DR-CAFTA promote profits for a few at the expense of the well being of the many.
Ironically, the pact even limits market competition to protect powerful special interests, undercutting the core principles of free trade.
Consider pharmaceuticals.
For American drug companies, this agreement extends the time period during which brand-name pharmaceuticals have exclusive access to markets, postponing the entry of generic drugs and thus limiting competition.
For Central Americans, the cost of drugs will soar, straining budgets and gutting health care.
The result may be a death sentence for many.
In agriculture, small farmers would be placed on a collision course with US agro-business and their heavily subsidized farm exports.
The US exported paddy rice, for example, at a price almost 20% lower than the cost of production in 2003, making it impossible for Central Americans to compete.
As for labor rights, the agreement makes a devil’s bargain: it opens trade while locking in a status quo that is appalling.
Workers face everything from rampant discrimination against older people (those over 35) to physical abuse, lack of bathroom breaks, no overtime pay, and poverty wages.
In principle, workers can seek remedies by joining a union and bargaining collectively.
But this option is all but foreclosed, because union membership or organizing can lead to dismissal, blacklisting, violence, or worse.
In Guatemala, the largest economy, less than 3% of workers are unionized and their unions are marginal.
The DR-CAFTA pays lip service to international labor standards as enshrined in the International Labor Organization’s core labor rights, but promptly throws them overboard.
Instead, countries are committed only to enforcing their own labor laws, which often seem designed to prevent workers from joining a union.
Moreover, enforcement of the rights that do exist is trapped somewhere between ineptitude and corruption.
As if this were not bad enough, the agreement jettisons everything we’ve learned over the last 30 years or so about international pressure and labor law reform.
The stronger provisions of previous trade agreements, such as the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), have been dumped.
Although trade with Central America represents only about 1.5% of total US trade, the outcome of the debate on DR-CAFTA will shape US trade policy – which sets the tone for other rich countries’ stance in trade talks – for years to come.
A trade agreement such as this puts US and Central American workers in the same labor market.
If the whip is cracked in Tegucigalpa today, workers in Charlotte will feel it tomorrow.
If Salvadorans’ wages are squeezed, they won’t be buying many products made in Los Angeles — unless, of course, they wind up moving there.
The anemic labor standards enshrined in this agreement encourage firms to compete by taking the low road, a route that puts them on a collision course with China’s rock-bottom wages.
They could just as easily take the high road: much evidence indicates that workers who are rewarded rather than victimized can contribute to greater competitiveness for firms in the long run.
It is hypocritical to promote democracy and then sign a trade agreement that denies workers the basic democratic right to organize and join unions.
Without this right, elections may not add up to democracy.
The checks and balances that unions provide are essential in the workplace, but they are even more important in sustaining fledgling democratic regimes.
The issue is not free trade versus protectionism, but “smart trade” versus “polarizing trade.”
Smart trade creates balanced development, while polarizing trade rewards a small circle of winners at the expense of the many.
Smart trade requires two key provisions: core labor rights, backed up by tough enforcement, and a development fund targeting infrastructure and education to boost competitiveness.
DR-CAFTA does neither.
Instead, it condemns Central America to carry its dismal past far into the future.
Rejecting it opens the possibility for freer markets and faster income growth in Central America, as well as healthier democracies.
Free Trade with a Human Face
MEXICO CITY – Although many Americans believe immigration is a domestic issue that should be excluded from talks with other governments, this is not a view held by other nations – or by the United States.
Indeed, the US negotiated its first immigration deal in 1907, maintained for more than two decades a controversial treaty with Mexico covering immigration, and has kept up immigration talks and deals even with Fidel Castro since the early 1960’s.
For many Latin American nations, not just Mexico, immigration is the single most important issue in their relations with the US.
The Caribbean islands all have a similarly high proportion of their citizens residing in the US and depend as much as Mexico on remittances.
The same is true for much of Central America.
And no part of South America is exempt from this pattern.
So almost all of Latin America is deeply affected by the current immigration climate in the US, and would benefit greatly from the type of comprehensive immigration reform that both John McCain and Barack Obama have supported.
The Bush administration’s regrettable decision to build fences along the US-Mexico border, raid workplaces and housing sites, detain and deport foreigners without papers, is viewed in Latin America as being hypocritical and offensive.
The issue is all the more painful and disappointing since most Latin American foreign ministries know full well that these attitudes are pure politics, nothing more.
Everyone knows what viable immigration reform in the US will entail: tightening security at the border, but also including gates in the walls currently being built; legalizing, with expeditious and sensible fines and conditions, the 15 million or so foreigners present in the US illegally; and establishing a migrant or temporary worker program that allows a sufficient number of foreigners to satisfy the growing needs of the US economy, with paths both to regular visits home and to US permanent residence.
A second component is political will and timing.
Bush had it right at the beginning: his willingness to negotiate an immigration agreement with Mexico at the start of his term was probably the only way to get it done.
Moving quickly is probably the only way the next president can succeed on this front as well.
If immigration is to become a less heated issue, the US must address the needs of Latin America’s economies.
Here, one of the key challenges facing the next US administration lies in the existing and pending free-trade agreements between the US and Latin America.
If John McCain is elected, tinkering with or overhauling NAFTA, CAFTA, and free-trade deals with Chile and Peru, as Barack Obama has proposed, will be unlikely.
But, given the likelihood that Democrats will retain their majorities in the US Congress, even McCain would need to modify the agreement with Colombia in order to get it passed.
The pressure to include similar provisions in the other deals would then grow.
If recession drags on and Americans continue to blame trade agreements – erroneously – for growing unemployment, falling wages, and yawning inequality, opposition to these deals will grow.
Instead of waiting for the pressure to mount, the next president would do well to preempt it with an ambitious agenda on free-trade reform that would benefit everyone.
In this respect, the US could learn from the European Union.
American trade agreements have been faulted for limiting themselves to trade.
The response has always been: the US is not Europe, nor is it in the business of nation-building or reconstruction.
But this is exactly what it did, successfully, with the post-1945 Marshall Plan and, unsuccessfully, with Iraq and Afghanistan today.
First, clear and explicit human rights and democracy clauses should be included, along the lines of similar clauses in the Mexican and Chilean Economic Association treaties with the EU.
Second, more specific provisions on labor, the environment, gender equality, and indigenous rights are needed, as well as anti-trust, regulatory, and judicial reform provisions, for reasons both of principle and political expediency.
Although there have been enormous improvements in most of these areas, there remains a huge agenda, particularly with regard to breaking up or regulating monopolies – public, private, commercial, trade union-based – that plague nearly every country in the region.
These revised agreements should include bold, enlightened provisions for infrastructure and “social-cohesion” funds, since these can make the difference between muddling through and true success.
Free-trade advocates should not view Obama’s demand that these deals be revisited as a mistake, but rather as an opportunity to improve and deepen them; McCain’s supporters should not see the incorporation of all of the aforementioned inclusions as “European nonsense,” but rather as a way to narrow the gap between the agreements’ promise and their actual results.
Improving Mexican and Central American infrastructure, education, and rule of law, or improving Colombian and Peruvian drug-enforcement efforts and respect for labor laws and human rights, are all in America’s interest, and-free trade agreements can help rather than harm such efforts.
If the US and Latin America can face up to the challenges of trade and immigration together, the next US president may leave a weightier mark on the hemispheric relationship than any American leader in three generations.
Freeze the Settlement Freeze
RAMALLAH – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to approve new Jewish settlements on the eve of a possible settlement freeze is the latest round in a cycle that has been repeated so many times over the past 40 years that it would seem mundane if it were not so dangerous.
The cycle goes something like this: American or international pressure mounts on Israel to stop settlement activities in the occupied territories.
Israeli settlers and their supporters then gather even more energy to expand onto more Palestinian land, build more exclusively Jewish settlements, and destroy more Arab homes before the so-called “freeze” comes into effect.
The peace process, not surprisingly, becomes a joke while this happens.
Eventually, world pressure subsides and the freeze fails to materialize. In the end, more Jewish settlements appear.
Indeed, the great paradox of this cycle is that more settlements are built during times of negotiations than during times of conflict.
This pattern can be traced to 1967.
Israelis understand that the only reality in politics is the reality on the ground.
So long as Israeli soldiers control the occupied territories, the idea of a settlement freeze will not take root.
In fact, the demand for a settlement freeze is nothing more than a call to arms to a wide group of Israelis and their supporters to go and build on stolen Palestinian land.
When Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was preparing for his historic visit to Jerusalem, a group of settlers created the settlement of Elon Moreh near Nablus, the most populated West Bank city.
When former United States Secretary of State James Baker began his shuttle diplomacy for peace, his ultimately unsuccessful efforts actually resulted in more settlements, with a new one started just hours before he was due to arrive for talks.
Baker postponed his visit and later vented his frustrations to the US Senate Committee on Appropriations.
He resented “being greeted” every time he came to the Middle East with yet “another settlement.”
Baker’s efforts eventually led to the Madrid peace conference in 1991, but that, too, failed to resolve the conflict.
And, while Palestinians and Israelis did reach a secret agreement a few years later that was publicly declared at a White House ceremony, construction of Jewish settlements didn’t stop.
In fact, since the 1993 Oslo Accords the number of Jewish settlers in the occupied territories has doubled.
The creation of new settlements has often been accompanied by hostile media reporting – even within Israel – as well as international condemnation, yet the settlement train has not stopped. It continued to race ahead even during the days when Israel’s government rotated between Likud’s Yitzhak Shamir and Labor’s Shimon Peres between 1984 and 1990.
The Shamir government would be defeated at the polls, and the incoming Labor government would declare a freeze on all settlement construction, even on buildings that had already been started.
But, despite the decrees, ways were found to continue building, to absorb new residents, and to increase the settler population.
For the US, the settlements have proven to be an equal-opportunity obstacle, obstructing both Republican and Democratic diplomacy.
The Clinton administration attempted to put brakes on then-Prime Minister Netanyahu’s efforts to construct a new settlement near Bethlehem. After a short hiatus, construction resumed.
The Bush-Cheney Administration, the most pro-Israeli in memory, fared no better.
Today, Har Homa, built on Jabal Abu Ghnaim with the aim of cutting off Bethlehem from Jerusalem, is home to 19,000 settlers.
This cycle has become so bizarre and confusing that Palestinians are not sure whether they should hope for continued tensions with Israel (which usually means no new settlements) or for continued negotiations (which usually provide cover for building settlements).
On January 5, 2007, the day Prime Minister Ehud Olmert met with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to discuss a new round of talks, the Israeli Construction and Housing Ministry issued a tender for the construction of more units in Ma’ale Adumim, an exclusively Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank.
Of course, whenever the Israelis defy the world over the settlements, as is now once again happening, US and other officials “denounce” and “regret” the decision.
But, at the end of the day, despite these few statements and perhaps even a UN resolution of opposition, the pattern established over the past 40 years is clear: the decision stands.
Jeff Aronson, a senior researcher at the Washington-based Foundation for Middle East Peace, concludes that Israeli leaders will continue to be able to fool their American counterparts on this issue.
Some Israeli right-wing leaders like Menachem Begin, Shamir, and Netanyahu trumpet their settlement achievements.
Others, including Yitzhak Rabin, Ehud Barak, and Ehud Olmert “talked left and built right.”
Palestinians are caught in a Catch-22: if they insist on a settlement freeze, Israel preemptively begins to build new settlements.
Unless and until Israel pays a heavy price for its illegal activities in the occupied territories, it is hard to imagine a successful peace process taking shape.
The Second Year of Europe
NEW YORK – More than four decades ago, US National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger declared 1973 to be “The Year of Europe.”
His aim was to highlight the need to modernize the Atlantic relationship and, more specifically, the need for America’s European allies to do more with the United States in the Middle East and against the Soviet Union in Europe.
Kissinger would be the first to admit that the Europeans did not take up his challenge.
Nevertheless, we again face a year of Europe.
This time, though, the impetus is coming less from a frustrated US government than from within Europe itself.
The stakes are as high as they were in 1973, if not higher.
Russia shows no sign of withdrawing from Crimea or stopping its efforts to destabilize eastern Ukraine.
There is genuine concern Russia might employ similar tactics against one or more of the small NATO countries on its border.
Refugees have added to Europe’s strain, as has terrorism inspired by events in the Middle East or carried out by attackers from the region.
Brexit, the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, has now formally begun; what remains to be resolved are its timing and terms, which will determine its impact on the UK’s economic and political future and on others contemplating withdrawal from the EU.
Greece and a number of other countries in southern Europe continue to be burdened by high unemployment, growing debt, and a persistent gap between what governments are being asked to do and what they can afford.
But of all the challenges confronting the EU, France’s upcoming presidential election holds the most significance for Europe’s future, and perhaps for that of the world.
Polls indicate that any of the four candidates could emerge as the eventual winner.
What makes this uncertainty different and truly consequential is that two of the four, National Front leader Marine Le Pen and far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, support policies far outside the French and European mainstream.
If either wins the second-round run-off on May 7, it could mean the end of French membership in both the EU and NATO, raising existential questions for both organizations – and for all of Europe.
Such scenarios were unimaginable until only recently.
For decades, Europe has constituted the world’s most successful, stable, and predictable region, a place where history seemed to have all but ended.
The goal of making the continent peaceful, whole, and free had largely been realized.
But dramatic change has come to Europe.
One factor is the willingness and ability shown by Vladimir Putin’s Russia to use military force, economic coercion, and cyber manipulation to advance its agenda.
But an even greater challenge to modern Europe comes from its own politicians, who increasingly question the value of the EU, the heir to the European Economic Community established in 1957 by the Treaty of Rome.
The rationale behind Europe’s six-decade-long integration process – often called the “European project” – was always clear.
Western Europe, and above all Germany and France, had to be unified to such a point that war, which had so often characterized the continent’s past, would become unthinkable.
This has been achieved, as has considerable economic progress.
But, along the way, the European project lost its hold on Europe’s citizens.
The EU’s institutions became too distant, too elitist, and too strong, not taking into account the national identities to which Europeans remained attached.
The ill-advised creation of a monetary union without a fiscal counterpart made matters worse.
The bureaucrats had overreached.
The rise of populist, nationalist candidates on both the left and the right in France and elsewhere in Europe is the result.
And even if one of the two establishment candidates prevails in France, much will remain uncertain.
The immediate crisis will have passed, but the long-term challenge will remain.
It is apparent that the EU needs to be rethought.
It needs to move away from “one size fits all” to something more flexible.
There also needs to be a rebalancing of power away from Brussels, the seat of most EU institutions, toward the national capitals.
Governments need to do more to create the prerequisites of faster economic growth while enhancing workers’ ability to contend with the inevitable elimination of many existing jobs as a result of technological innovation.
Germany, whether led by its current chancellor or her principal opponent after its general election in September, will need to take the lead here.
Europeans, appropriately enough, will mostly determine Europe’s future.
But the Trump administration also has a role to play.
Trump’s shortsighted support for Brexit and other exits from the EU must end; a divided, weaker, and distracted Europe will not be a good partner in NATO.
It may be true that Asia is more likely than Europe to shape the history of the twenty-first century.
But the lesson of the last century should not be lost: what happens in Europe can and will affect global stability and prosperity.
Reinventing the French People
PARIS – “It is accomplished…” In the years when I listened to music nonstop, the passage marked by those words was for me one of the most intriguing in Bach’s St. John Passion.
In a plaintive soprano accompanied by a cello’s lament, lingering between song and silence, the memory came back to me on Monday morning, the day after the second round of France’s parliamentary election.
The event that has been accomplished, of course, is President Emmanuel Macron’s plan to obtain a majority in the National Assembly.
But, whether we like it or not, there is more to the event than that.
Another accomplishment was the record-high abstention rate: 57% of French voters disdained the rare and precious privilege of voting, a privilege invented several centuries ago by men who believed in deliberation, reason, and enlightenment.
Inevitably, we will hear commentary about an electorate exhausted from a dramatic year in which France’s political foundations shifted and its traditional points of reference were obscured.
We will be told about the inner wisdom of a nation that already knew the outcome and wished, without saying so, to avoid the appearance of an excessive victory.
Blame will be placed on the weather, the bridges, the media, the bitterness of spurned leaders, and the unknown quantities represented by the new faces of the president’s army of candidates.
But I do not believe that these anecdotal responses will hold up for long.
I cannot avoid hearing, in the deafening silence of the millions who abstained, the dissonant note one always detects in victorious fanfares.
One never knows, at first, whether it is just a false note, the sound of things falling and continuing to roll briefly before finally coming to a stop, or a real clunker, a more jarring interruption, the herald of a real crisis.
And we cannot rule out that Sunday’s most salient statistic (that 57%!) signifies not only the last gasp of the supine corpses that had been yesterday’s political apparatus (and that may rise again to become tomorrow’s populist parties).
It could also reflect a process of dereliction, desertion, and dispersal; one that affects, beyond the vote, the idea that the French hold of themselves, an idea that suddenly appears phantasmagoric.
Hobbes warned us. “The people” is always an artifact.
Given the unsociable sociability of human beings, driven by their appetites and passions, the process by which it is fashioned is both brazen and fragile.
And, in the real world, it is the social contract, with its institutions and procedures, its modes of deliberation, delegation, and mediation, and, in particular, its votes, that stands behind the noble invention of a “people” and accounts for the fact that those who comprise it occasionally take a break from tearing each other limb from limb.
I cannot help but wonder, in the aftermath of France’s “Abstention Sunday,” whether the sound we hear is not the seizing up of this splendid, subtle machine.
I wonder, too, if we are not nearing the end of a process of dissolution that now threatens to turn the abstraction of “the people” irreversibly into a fiction, one nearly impossible to imagine (let alone put a face to) and even more difficult to believe.
I wonder if the satisfaction of being a people – as invented by the first Europeans and Americans, reinvented by the French celebrants of national unity on July 14, 1790, and celebrated by the French historian and poet Michelet – is not becoming a thing of the past.
That would seem to leave us to choose between two stances.
We can accommodate ourselves to this irreality and Macron’s newly installed representatives, so preternaturally smooth and remote as to suggest that they might have been elected while Leviathan was sleeping.
Or we can rely on Facebook and Twitter to restore a semblance of will and sovereignty to what used to be called the people, by technical means that enable real-time responses to instant referenda.
But there is another alternative: to detect in the prospect of answers without questions and choices, without deliberation or even thought, a path that will lead eventually only to more inhumanity, owing to the urges that may at any moment take hold of a people that senses itself withering away.
In that case, we could gird ourselves with intelligence, reason, and courage; return in force to the political arena; and, inspired by the Enlightenment’s legacy, recast in today’s language the theorems of representative democracy, a political system that remains (and will long remain) without peer.
We must reassemble what is falling apart and drifting away like icebergs.
We must close the wound from which flows the lifeblood of a fragmented society.
In short, we the people must refound ourselves on the rubble of a smoldering world that trembles beneath our feet.
Such is the true revolution toward which Macron and his parliamentary majority will have to work in France.
The task is immense, historic, and ultimately meta-political.
No single individual, nor several, nor even an overwhelming majority can accomplish it.
What will be needed is the general will – no longer just individual or collective, but truly general – of the Republic of France.
And then, as in Bach’s St. John Passion, in which the lamentation that “It is accomplished” is followed by strings of Resurrection, it will become possible once again to discern in France’s politics the traces of French history – and the path to France’s future.
Another Strange French Disaster
PARIS – The “hunger games” aspect of this French election cycle began on the left.
President François Hollande was brought down by his own Socialist Party.
Hollande’s prime minister, Manuel Valls, became the second course at the cannibals’ banquet.
By then, the corpse of one of France’s two major parties, no longer merely supine, had reached an advanced state of decomposition.
Now, at the very moment when one might expect a presidential candidate to tell the nation what he thinks of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Islamic radicals, the Socialist candidate, the wan Benoît Hamon, finds nothing better to talk about than legal marijuana, red sludge, and endocrine disruptors.
On the right, the disaster is just now cresting.
Early on, former president Nicolas Sarkozy was eliminated.
Former Prime Minister Alain Juppé, after being crowned virtual president for much of last year, was toppled by those who had adored him.
And, in the wake of the scandal surrounding François Fillon, the Republican nominee and the man who defeated him, Juppé lost his nerve and on March 6 definitively quit the race.
Fillon, once the clear frontrunner, the choice of four million primary voters, has now brought forth the spectacle of a party of mutineers trying to nudge him out of the race.
Schemes, evasions, calculations, and bargains multiply, all based on polls interpreted by the modern equivalents of Roman haruspices.
Another corpse.
Enter the investigating magistrates, who obviously are playing their rightful role in hearing evidence about a fake jobs scandal involving Fillon’s wife and children.
Their integrity, however, will not be impugned by a gentle reminder that they, too, are human beings, susceptible to human passions and resentments; that the considerable power they wield tends, as all power does, to reach as far as it can; and that, as a consequence, they have become fully enmeshed in a campaign from which, invoking Montesquieu, they should strive scrupulously to hold themselves at a distance.
But we, citizens and voters – each and every one of us – are the worst part of this entire picture.
Our new and strange relationship to politics, as evidenced by the current circumstances, can be summed up in three terms.
Cancan.
Or, more accurately, can’t-can’t: the griping we do upon the Wednesday appearance of the new Le Canard Enchaîné, the satirical weekly whose insurrectionary humor, once fodder for the loose cannons of the left and right, is becoming the everyday language of politics.
There was a time when reading the newspaper was, according to Hegel, the philosopher’s morning prayer.
Now reading that particular newspaper feeds the electorate’s insatiable appetite for ridicule.
With what sardonic anticipation French readers await the latest on the base doings of our elected officials and their rivals!
With what greedy delectation do we devour our weekly dose of corruption, rot, and scandal!
And what bleak disappointment we feel, what sudden loss of interest in life, when, by chance, there is nothing new to report.
Ought we not bear in mind, with the poet Stéphane Mallarmé, that when we amuse ourselves thus and become so inebriated with scandal, we “yawn gloomily toward a dark demise.”
Spectacle.
In lieu of judgment, we get ceaseless and frivolous commentary on the thousand and one twists and turns of the electoral contest.
Once, the news media covered sports as if it were politics.
Now political commentary resembles sports coverage.
“Game analysis” has become the paradigm of political narrative.
And, in the venerable country said by Marx to be the political nation par excellence, politics is becoming a subspecies of soccer, with its teams, fans, referees, and high scorers.
Is it any surprise that at the height of the Fillon affair, the right-wing bosses and their phantom coaches turned (doctrinal and stylistic differences be damned!) to their benchwarmers, who were supposed to be waiting to enter the game?
Likewise, one wonders whether Fillon’s loyalists see in him anything more than his stamina, his ability to take a beating, or the figure he cut when, after being knocked flat on his back, he got up as if returning to an unfinished fight.
Equality.
Eagerness for it was, once, the noblest of passions; there was, in that passion, the dream of cultivating the body politic and, in so doing, dignifying politics.
And I agree with the philosopher Jean-Claude Milner who, in his recent book, Relire la Révolution, takes on the Anatole France of The Gods Are Athirst.
Far from simply offering the people their daily ration of blood, Robespierre also tried, in his way, to check the descent of the masses into a vengeful mob and to save what could be saved of the balances inherent in republican hierarchy.
There is none of that in today’s brand of egalitarianism – nothing but a mob inching ever closer to its moment of ultimate power while promoting an equality not of common interest but of complaints, indignities, grudges, and corruption.
And, among the fragmented, distraught children of the Enlightenment, among the zombie heirs of Rousseau fibrillating between aggressiveness, blindness, and despair, equality is no longer a task but a taint, a sort of dark shroud, a halo of resentment and hatred to which our common tongue is tied as to a buoy in a tide.
Another disaster.
Another delusion.
From redemptive egalitarianism to equal-opportunity grousing and score-settling, we have hiked the path that leads a society from life to death.
Frightening as it sounds, that is where France finds itself: not in a mere crisis, but in the last stages of what the great anti-Nazi historian Marc Bloch called, in 1940, his nation’s “strange defeat.”
We confront not a lone tree of iniquity, but rather a vast forest of murky words, dangerous and lunatic in their debasement.
And, lying in wait, guided by the Eumenides (the Greek deities of vengeance whose name is synonymous with fury as well as justice), a figure is taking shape as if, in classical terms, in fulfillment of a dreadful fate: Marine Le Pen.
The French Exception?
PARIS – More than ever, the French economy is at the center of the global debate about how far one can push the limits of state size and control in a capitalist democracy.
To those on the left, France’s generous benefits and strong trade unions provide a formula for a more inclusive welfare state.
To those on the right, France’s oversized and intrusive government offers only a blueprint for secular decline.
For the moment, the right looks right.
Once nearly the economic equal of Germany, France has fallen well behind over the past decade, with per capita GDP now about 10% lower.
France may punch above its weight politically, but it punches far below its weight economically.
Whenever someone proposes turning the eurozone into a transfer union, as France’s economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, recently did, the presumption is that Germany will carry everyone else on its shoulders.
But why should only Germany have that responsibility?
France’s economy is roughly three-quarters the size of Germany’s.
Persuading the Germans that the French are willing and able to pay their fair share could make room for a lot of necessary compromises that until now have seemed impossible.
For now, few people feel confident about France’s economic future.
The good news is that France is not quite as French as it pretends to be.
Yes, there is a 35-hour workweek, but companies can negotiate around the limit by offering to pay more for overtime.
The effective workweek for most workers is perhaps closer to 39 hours.
Yes, France has sought to limit the car service Uber, whose business model has arguably been one of the most transformative and important advances of the decade.
But, while this is a triumph for taxi unions and a tragedy for passengers and Uber drivers, France has also started focusing on nurturing small, high-potential technology companies.
The French government is no longer placing all its bets on big, state-led projects, as it did in the 1970s heyday of massive investment in high-speed trains and Airbus.
President François Hollande has given Macron wide berth to try to implement desperately needed structural reforms of labor and product markets.
Of course, it remains to be seen just how much political support such market-oriented policies can sustain.
Progressive economists love the French government for spending a staggering 57% of GDP, compared to government expenditures of 44% of GDP for Germany.
And it must be acknowledged that the French government provides excellent value in some key areas.
France’s health service justly receives much better reviews than the United Kingdom’s.
French citizens might pay a lot of taxes and suffer a high degree of regulation, but at least they get something in return.
Still, France’s supersize government is hardly a source of unalloyed dynamism.
And indeed, one suspects that France’s GDP and productivity measures are flattered by the fact that, for lack of market prices, statisticians blindly assume that citizens get one dollar of value for each dollar spent on government, which might be an overstatement.
Worryingly, it is not clear how well France’s culture of inclusiveness can ever extend to immigrants.
The same strict firing laws and high levels of minimum wages that are intended to protect native French workers from globalization make it much more difficult for newcomers to land jobs.
Yet virtually every study of global inequality suggests that gains from allowing greater labor mobility dwarf gains from redistributing income among natives.
By contrast, the more liberal labor laws in the United States and the United Kingdom ensure more opportunities for outsiders.
The center of Paris and other French cities may be grand, but many immigrants from North Africa and elsewhere live in squalid ghettos on the outskirts.
Although the precise rate of unemployment for particular ethnic groups is not known (French law precludes collecting data by ethnic classification), anecdotal evidence suggests much higher levels of joblessness for immigrants and their descendants.
True, the government provides generous welfare benefits; but this alone does not produce inclusiveness.
Strong popular support for Marine Le Pen’s anti-immigration National Front party, together with French recalcitrance about accepting migrants escaping the war in Syria, indicates the problems with applying the French model in diverse societies.
Another obstacle to applying the French model elsewhere is that France enjoys certain unique advantages that are arguably critical to its success.
Elite French managers are widely considered among the best in the world, and are frequently selected to head major international corporations.
Corruption is certainly a problem, but significantly less so than in most of the eurozone’s south. (The Italian state is also large and intrusive, but it does not produce the high-quality public services that the French government does.)
Lastly, France arguably has one of the world’s most favorable natural environments, with fertile soil and an exceptionally temperate climate.
A healthy French economy would do wonders to help lift the eurozone out of its malaise.
It could also provide an example to countries everywhere of how inclusive capitalism can work.
But that assumes that the government will embrace the structural reforms that France’s economy so desperately needs.
The Monetarist Mistake
BERKELEY – Ideas matter.
That is the lesson of Hall of Mirrors, the American economist Barry Eichengreen’s chronicle of the two biggest economic crises of the past 100 years: the twentieth century’s Great Depression and the ongoing Great Recession, from which we are still struggling ineffectually to recover.
Eichengreen is my friend, teacher, and patron, and his book is to my mind the best explanation to date of why policymakers in Europe and the United States have reacted to the most dramatic economic collapse in almost four generations with half-hearted measures and half-finished interventions.
According to Eichengreen, the Great Depression and the Great Recession are related.
The inadequate response to our current troubles can be traced to the triumph of the monetarist disciples of Milton Friedman over their Keynesian and Minskyite peers in describing the history of the Great Depression.
In A Monetary History of the United States, published in 1963, Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz famously argued that the Great Depression was due solely and completely to the failure of the US Federal Reserve to expand the country’s monetary base and thereby keep the economy on a path of stable growth.
Had there been no decline in the money stock, their argument goes, there would have been no Great Depression.
This interpretation makes a certain kind of sense, but it relies on a critical assumption.
Friedman and Schwartz’s prescription would have worked only if interest rates and what economists call the “velocity of money” – the rate at which money changes hands – were largely independent of one another.
What is more likely, however, is that the drop in interest rates resulting from the interventions needed to expand the country’s supply of money would have put a brake on the velocity of money, undermining the proposed cure.
In that case, ending the Great Depression would have also required the fiscal expansion called for by John Maynard Keynes and the supportive credit-market policies prescribed by Hyman Minsky.
The debate over which interventions would be needed to put a halt to something like the Great Depression should have been a simple matter of analyzing the evidence.
In economic hard times, did interest rates have little impact on the velocity of money, as Friedman suggested?
Was Keynes correct when he described the concept of a liquidity trap, a situation in which easing monetary policy further proves ineffective?
Is the stock of money in an economy an adequate predictor of total spending, as Friedman claimed, or is the smooth functioning of credit channels a more important factor, as Minsky argued?
These questions can be debated.
But it is fairly clear that even in the 1970s there was not enough empirical evidence in support of Friedman’s ideas to justify their growing dominance.
And, indeed, there can be no denying the fact that Friedman’s cure proved to be an inadequate response to the Great Recession – strongly suggesting that it would have fallen similarly short had it been tried during the Great Depression.
The dominance of Friedman’s ideas at the beginning of the Great Recession has less to do with the evidence supporting them than with the fact that the science of economics is all too often tainted by politics.
In this case, the contamination was so bad that policymakers were unwilling to go beyond Friedman and apply Keynesian and Minskyite policies on a large enough scale to address the problems that the Great Recession presented.
Admitting that the monetarist cure was inadequate would have required mainstream economists to swim against the neoliberal currents of our age.
It would have required acknowledging that the causes of the Great Depression ran much deeper than a technocratic failure to manage the money supply properly.
And doing that would have been tantamount to admitting the merits of social democracy and recognizing that the failure of markets can sometimes be a greater danger than the inefficiency of governments.
The result was a host of policies based not on evidence, but on inadequately examined ideas.
And we are still paying the price for that intellectual failure today.
From Central Bank to Central Planning?
BERKELEY – For more than 170 years, it has been accepted doctrine that markets are not to be trusted when there is a liquidity squeeze.
When the prices of even safe assets fall and interest rates climb to sky-high levels because traders and financiers collectively want more liquid assets than currently exist, it is simply not safe to let the market sort things out.
At such a time, central banks must step in and set the price of liquidity at a reasonable level – make it a centrally-planned and administered price – rather than let it swing free in response to private-sector supply and demand.
This is the doctrine of “lender-of-last-resort.”
For more than half that time – say, 85 years – it has been accepted doctrine that markets are also not to be trusted even in normal times, lest doing so lead to a liquidity squeeze or to an inflationary bubble.
So, central banks must set the price of liquidity in the market day in and day out.
According to the followers of Knut Wicksell, the central bank must keep the market rate of interest near the natural rate of interest.
No, said the followers of John Maynard Keynes, it must offset swings in business animal spirits in order to stabilize aggregate demand.
On the contrary, said the followers of Milton Friedman, it must keep the velocity-adjusted rate of growth of the money stock stable.
In fact, if you do any one of these things, you have done them all, for they are three ways of describing what is at bottom the same task and the same reality.
Thus, as social democracy, government guideposts, and centralized planning waxed and waned elsewhere in the economy, social democracy in short-term finance went from strength to strength.
First, central banks suspended the rules of the free market in liquidity squeezes.
Then they set the price of liquidity as an administered price in normal times.
Then they freed themselves of all but the lightest contact with their political masters: they became independent technocrats, a monetary priesthood that spoke in Delphic terms obscure to mere mortals.
The justification for this system was that it seemed to work well – or at least less badly than central banking that blindly adhered to the gold standard or no central banking at all.
This island of central planning in the midst of the market economy was a strange and puzzling feature – all the more so because so few remarked how strange it was.
There were no calls for a five-percent-growth-of-kilowatt-hours rule as there were calls for a five-percent-growth-of-M2 rule.
There was no Federal Automobile Board to set the price of vehicles the way the Federal Reserve Board set the price of federal funds.
But now it appears that, despite all this, we still have not had enough central planning in finance.
For, even as the central banking authority administered the price of liquidity, the price of risk was left to the tender mercies of the market.
And it is the price of risk that is the source of our current distress.
It is not that the world economy faces a liquidity squeeze.
Far from it: two-year United States Treasury notes with a face value of $1,000 will get you $998 in cash – the lowest liquidity price since the Great Depression and Japan in the 1990’s.
Yet the risk premia on non-Treasury assets have soared to barely believable heights: the annual interest-rate premium for holding a CD issued by a private bank now stands at five percentage points.
And it is this rise in risk premia that threatens to send the global economy into a deep recession, and turn the financial markets from a spectacle of schadenfreude into a malign source of unemployment and idle factories worldwide.
The US Federal Reserve, the US Treasury, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and other public financial regulatory entities are being pushed toward a further expansion of their roles.
The Treasury and Federal Reserve are adding preferred stock to the balance sheets of the US mortgage giants Fannie Mae and FHLBC and the insurance giant AIG in the hope of shoring up their capital cushions and lowering their borrowing costs so that they can buy more mortgages.
The Treasury has asked for authority to purchase $700 billion of mortgages to get them off of the private sector's books.
Expanding the demand and reducing the supply of these risky assets is a way of manipulating their price.
The Fed and the Treasury are walking down a road that ends with making the price of risk in financial markets, along with the price of liquidity, an administered price.
This was how central banking got started in the first place: letting the market and the market alone determine the price of liquidity was judged too costly for the businessmen who voted and the workers who could overthrow governments.
Now it looks as though letting the market alone determine the price of risk is similarly being judged too costly for today’s voters and campaign contributors to bear.
America’s Trouble with China
WASHINGTON, DC – Xi Jinping, China’s newly anointed president, made his first visit to the United States in May 1980.
He was a 27-year-old junior officer accompanying Geng Biao, then a vice premier and China’s leading military official.
Geng had been my host the previous January, when I was the first US defense secretary to visit China, acting as an interlocutor for President Jimmy Carter’s administration.
Americans had little reason to notice Xi back then, but his superiors clearly saw his potential.
In the ensuing 32 years, Xi’s stature rose, along with China’s economic and military strength.
His cohort’s ascent to the summit of power marks the retirement of the last generation of leaders designated by Deng Xiaoping (though they retain influence).
Despite China’s greater weight in world affairs, Xi faces internal strains that make China more fragile than is generally understood.
China’s export-led economic model has reached its limits, and the transition to domestic-led growth is intensifying internal frictions.
Managing unrest through repression is more difficult than in the past, as rapid urbanization, economic reform, and social change roils a country of 1.3 billion people.
Ethnic conflicts in outlying regions will also test Xi’s political control.
China’s foreign policy is another cause for concern – especially for the US.
History teaches us that rising powers inevitably compete with status quo leading powers, and that this conflict often leads to war.
For now, the large bilateral trade imbalance has exacerbated US-China tensions, and can be safely reduced only by changes in behavior on both sides – or, unsafely, though a dangerous crisis-driven correction.
More immediately, China’s territorial claims – particularly in the South China Sea, but also regarding its border with India – and its efforts to expand its influence over neighboring countries will force the US to navigate two overarching risks.
The first is confrontation, which could occur directly or as a result of the US being drawn into conflicts between China and its neighbors.
The other risk is that Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, or Myanmar could fall into China’s strategic orbit.
Many of these countries will look to the US as a strategic counterweight should China seek to assert local dominance.
But some may conclude that it is safer to steer closer to China than away from it, because their economies depend so strongly on Chinese trade.
As recent events in the East and South China Seas show, China sometimes attempts to strong-arm its neighbors.
The US will need to defend its allies and interests by pushing back, but with actions modulated to limit Chinese concerns.
One way to do this is to understand China’s motives.
China’s drive for economic and political leadership in East Asia, and its increased military capability there, is inevitable.
But the world can be confident that the US will remain stronger, wealthier, and more influential in global affairs than China even in 2030.
That argues against American overreaction, which could fuel the kind of self-reinforcing downward spiral in bilateral relations that occurred between Great Britain and Germany prior to the conflagrations of the first half of the twentieth century.
Perhaps the best way to avoid confrontation is to cooperate on shared external threats, most notably nuclear proliferation, global climate change, and Islamic extremism.
But getting to 2030 without a major confrontation will be a major achievement.
While the US is likely to maintain the upper hand in terms of military power for at least another 15-20 years, asymmetric warfare could undercut America’s advantage should China engage in cyber-attacks on US electronic and satellite systems, along with attacks on infrastructure.
In response to China’s capability to project power many hundreds of miles from its borders, the US (as I have suggested for the last 25 years) should develop a long-range bomber capable of penetrating sophisticated defenses and delivering great force.
As US security interests shift to the Pacific, Americans now rely on increasingly vulnerable forward land bases and carrier fleets with tactical aircraft that have a combat radius of 300-500 miles (482-805 kilometers).
But a long-range bomber would be more cost-effective than standoff bombers with cruise missiles, and, unlike shorter-range tactical bombers, its bases would be invulnerable to attack.
That said, America’s most serious challenge right now is to get the US economy and its governance in order.
I believe that it can do that.
But, unless and until it does, thereby giving President Barack Obama a firm basis from which to engage Xi on issues requiring international statesmanship, the prospect of trouble between the US and China will continue to grow.
From Constitutional Crisis to European Crisis
Since the shock of the French and Dutch “no” votes against the European Union’s proposed Constitutional Treaty, events have followed their inevitable course, but more rapidly than expected.
The French “no” was a massive blow to the political credibility of French President Jacques Chirac.
So he did what French Presidents usually do in such circumstances: rather than admit that French voters might be right, he sacked Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin as a scapegoat, replacing him with his protégé Dominique de Villepin, who has never held an elective office.
Opinions differ as to the reasons for France’s rejection of the Constitutional Treaty.
But most analyses suggest that it was directed against high unemployment, magnified by the perceived threat to jobs from the new Central and Eastern European EU members.
Naturally, Chirac immediately reaffirmed his faith in the French economic model.
The most undeniable implication of the French vote has been to raise a large question mark over the future of the EU’s traditional integration project.
Rather than admit any such thing, Chirac hurried to meet German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, so that they could jointly reaffirm their traditional alliance as the spiritual leaders of this European project, in the hope that the Constitutional Treaty might yet be rescued.
Neither of them have been able to say how this should be done.
The British government tried to wriggle out of taking sides on the implications of the French and Dutch votes by saying that it would suspend its own plans for a referendum, but not cancel it outright.
But if the government thought that this mid-way position would finesse its European predicament by appeasing the large anti-European majority in the UK without gratuitously offending the EU’s other members, it was quickly disabused.
One consequence of last year’s enlargement is that it is forcing a far-reaching re-negotiation of all aspects of the EU budget.
Most of the ten new members are much poorer than the old members, and are thus much less able or willing to pay large financial contributions.
They expect to be net financial beneficiaries, which would help them modernize.
But the old member states that have hitherto benefited most from the budget – poorer countries like Spain, Greece, and Portugal – want the budget to be expanded, so that they can continue to receive money.
Old member states that have traditionally contributed most, like Germany and the Netherlands, want to keep the budget as small as possible.
Given this looming negotiation between old and new – and between rich and poor – and because Chirac has no cunning proposal for resurrecting the EU Constitution, he has sought and found a second scapegoat: Britain has, for over 20 years, benefited from a large rebate in its outsized contribution to the EU budget.
By design the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) gives large financial benefits to countries with large farming sectors, like France, but imposes financial penalties on countries with small farming sectors, like Britain.
This inequity long rankled in Britain.
In 1984, Margaret Thatcher demanded and got a large rebate in the British net contribution, which this year is worth roughly €5bn.
Ever since, this concession has been resented by other member states.
Last week, Chirac decided to raise the stakes in the European crisis by going on the offensive against Britain.
The time has come, he said, for “our English friends” to understand that they have to make a gesture of solidarity, and renounce the rebate negotiated by Thatcher.
The British government’s first reflex was to reject any suggestion that the British rebate is open to discussion: it was justified in 1984, and it is justified today.
But Tony Blair has now gone on the counter-offensive, raising the stakes himself.
Britain, he says, might be prepared to put the British rebate on the table, but only if the French are prepared to remove the reasons for it by means of a radical renegotiation of EU farm policy.
From a narrowly British perspective, this might seem a shrewd and reasonable posture for defending British interests.
But, by picking up Chirac’s challenge, Blair has allowed himself to be drawn away from the general European dilemma (what to do about the Constitutional Treaty) – for which Britain is not to blame – to a specific policy problem (the CAP’s finances) on which Britain is isolated.
Coming from anyone else, Blair’s proposal to re-think the CAP might seem reasonable; indeed, over the years, the EU has tried (slowly) to reform its defects.
Unfortunately, in eight years of power, Tony Blair reinforced the widespread impression in the rest of the EU, that the UK is irremediably skeptical about European integration.
His proposal will thus be seen for what it is, a counter-attack on a founding policy of the European project.
The danger is that this week’s EU summit will not be devoted to finding a solution to the dilemma of the French and Dutch “no” votes, but instead will be turned into a confrontation between Britain and the rest about the budget.
This would be a pity for Europe and for Britain.
It would underscore the depth of the chasm between leaders who are seeking to advance the cause of European political integration but are out of touch with their electorates, and the British, who do not like European political integration at all.
The Biodiversity Bargain
NAIROBI – What will it cost to save the world’s forests and boost the life prospects of its seven billion people?
In a few days, India will host a meeting in Hyderabad of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.
The assembled countries will consider how to raise the resources necessary to achieve the ambitious Aichi Biodiversity Targets, adopted two years ago at the last such meeting in Japan.
The Aichi targets call for cutting by half the rate of loss of the planet’s natural habitats, including forests, by 2020.
In Hyderabad, governments will be presented with the likely costs of scaling up efforts to achieve that goal.
One assessment estimates that about $40 billion a year will be needed to halve rates of deforestation and ensure sustainable management of forests in developing countries by the target date.
The cost may seem significant in a world of rising unemployment rates, with many countries still struggling with ongoing financial and economic crises, and others staring bankruptcy in the face.
But the cost of preserving the world’s biodiversity needs to be contrasted with the enormous economic and social value of forests in terms of the benefits that they provide locally and globally.
Forests ensure water supplies, counter soil erosion, and safeguard an abundance of genetic resources that will become increasingly important in developing the new products, pharmaceuticals, and crop strains needed to support the lives and livelihoods of more than nine billion people by 2050.
Moreover, investing in forest conservation and sustainable land use is one of the most cost-effective means of mitigating climate change.
The potential returns from targeted investments in forests are immense.
Restoring just 15% of degraded forest landscapes worldwide could generate up to $85 billion worth of ecosystem services every year, mostly benefiting rural and underprivileged communities.
Estimates of the value of the Mau forest complex to the Kenyan economy, for example, are $1.5 billion a year.
Similar estimates are underway in Brazil, Colombia, India, and elsewhere.
The cost of inaction would be considerably higher than the required investment.
The annual cost of adapting to climate change has now passed the $40 billion mark, and is expected to rise every year unless we can significantly reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
Some countries are already stepping up to the challenge.
Norway is investing $3 billion to support national and international initiatives, including the UN-REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) Program, a joint effort of three UN agencies to support developing countries’ efforts to save, sustainably manage, and restore tropical forests (a range of activities known as REDD+).
Brazil has reduced deforestation rates in the Amazon by roughly 80% since 2005, and Norway’s pledge of $1 billion is helping to achieve further reductions.
Brazil’s efforts have led to perhaps the biggest emission reduction of any country in the world – at a time when deforestation accounts for around 15% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.
The UN-REDD Program, launched in 2008, currently supports 44 developing countries, with 16 countries receiving direct financial and technical support.
The funding is preparing them, for example, to develop monitoring systems and build support and awareness among local communities and indigenous peoples for a fresh start to forest management.
Some are already seizing the funding opportunities under what is essentially a climate-change initiative to pursue broader sustainability goals.
For example, Indonesia is seeking to establish a Green Corridor in Kalimantan (the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo), where deforestation is not only fueling greenhouse-gas emissions, but also diminishing river flows, making it difficult in some months to transport goods by barge.
Given that transportation by barge costs about $10 a ton, compared to close to $60 a ton by road, REDD+ offers a chance to hold down greenhouse-gas emissions while preserving an economically important sector.
While Norway has made the biggest commitment to UN-REDD and other initiatives to date, other donors – including the European Commission, Denmark, Japan, and Spain – are also contributing.
Enlightened businesses, which will be key to meeting the 2020 funding goals, are also investing in sustainable forest management.
Countering deforestation is not without its challenges.
Governance and land-tenure systems must be improved in many countries, and the risk of corruption must be addressed rigorously.
In Hyderabad, countries and experts will consider how safeguards can ensure that both people and nature benefit from REDD+ activities.
Nevertheless the challenges should not mask or deflect attention from the opportunities.
The UN-REDD Program is just four years old, and the best is yet to come.
Whether to combat climate change or to realize wider environmental benefits, the need for enhanced financing of forests can no longer be ignored.
And there is a final imperative: 1.4 billion people currently depend for their livelihoods on forests.
Annual investments of $40 billion per year could generate five million new jobs globally.
The world is struggling to fight climate change, sustain a growing global population, and find decent jobs for millions of young people.
Investing in forests and biodiversity represents a root-and-branch response to these challenges.
But it requires more ambitious and wider public- and private-sector support.
With a price tag of around $40 billion per year, the cost of that support is, to be frank, a bargain.
From Depression to Freedom
Clinical depression affects roughly one in four people at some point in their lives.
It is a severe and prolonged state of mind in which normal sadness grows into a painful state of hopelessness, listlessness, lack of motivation, and fatigue.
But, however well defined, clinical depression is many things to many people, varying from mild to severe.
Mild depression can result in brooding on negative aspects of self or others, feeling resentful, irritable or angry much of the time, feeling sorry for oneself, and needing constant reassurance from someone.
It can also result in various physical complaints that do not seem to be caused by any physical illness.
As depression worsens, feelings of extreme sadness and hopelessness combine with low self-esteem, guilt, memory loss, and concentration difficulties to bring about a severely painful state of mind.
To make things worse, there may be a change in basic bodily functions.
The usual daily rhythms seem to go wrong: can’t sleep, or sleep too much, can’t eat, or eat too much. Enthusiasm for what are usually enjoyable activities fades.
Sometimes, there is even a feeling that life is not worth living and that one would be better off dead.
The most commonly used treatment for major depression is antidepressant medication.
It is relatively cheap, and it is easy for family practitioners, who treat the majority of depressed people, to prescribe.
However, when the episode has passed, and medication ceases, depression tends to return, and at least 50% of those who experienced an initial episode of depression find that depression comes back, despite appearing to have made a full recovery.
After a second or third episode, the risk of recurrence rises to 80-90%.
Early onset depression (before 20 years of age) is particularly associated with a significantly higher risk of relapse and recurrence.
For those who have been suicidal in the past, any depressed mood is likely to be accompanied by a return of suicidal thinking.
The problem with viewing antidepressants as the main method for preventing recurrence is that many people do not want to stay on medication for indefinite periods, and when the medication stops, the risk of becoming depressed again returns.
Finding new ways of helping people stay well after depression demands an understanding of why depression keeps returning.
During a period of crisis in which someone becomes depressed and suicidal, an association is learned between the various symptoms (low mood, physical pain, suicidal tendencies, and so on).
This means that when the negative mood returns, for any reason, it will tend to trigger all the other symptoms – a process called “cognitive reactivity”).
The discovery that the link between negative moods and negative thoughts remains ready to be reactivated even when people feel well is hugely important: it means that preventing future crises depends on learning how to keep mild upsets from spiraling out of control.
Research has shown that combining the ancient practice of meditation with modern psychotherapies can accomplish this.
Based on Jon Kabat Zinn’s Stress Reduction program at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) combines modern cognitive behavioral therapy with meditation practices to help people become more aware of the present moment, including getting in touch with moment-to-moment changes in the mind and body (see www.mbct.co.uk).
In weekly classes (the atmosphere is that of a class, rather than a therapy group), and by listening to CD’s or tapes at home during the week, participants learn the practice of mindfulness meditation.
The classes also include basic education about our moods, and several exercises from cognitive therapy that show the links between thinking and feeling and how participants can best look after themselves when a crisis threatens to overwhelm them.
The MBCT approach helps participants in the classes to see more clearly the patterns of the mind and to learn how to recognize when their mood is starting to sink.
It helps break the normal link between negative mood and negative thinking.
Participants develop the capacity to allow distressing moods, thoughts, and sensations to come and go, without having to battle with them.
They find that they can stay in touch with the present moment without having to ruminate about the past or worry about the future.
Thus, they come to see with greater clarity and conviction how to approach moment-by-moment experience skillfully, taking more pleasure in the good things that often go unnoticed or unappreciated while dealing more effectively with the difficulties encountered, whether real or imagined.
Two controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that MBCT can reduce the likelihood of relapse by about 40-50% in people who have suffered three or more previous episodes of depression.
As a result of such findings, MBCT has now been included in the British government’s national guidelines for treating recurrent major depression.
But this implies a redefinition of treatment itself.
As our understanding of depression grows and we see that it is a recurring problem, the emphasis is shifting from cure to prevention.
Mindfulness-based approaches have already proven that they will play an enormously important role in this.
From Football to Fascism in Russia
MOSCOW – In Russia, 2010 ended with an unprecedented upsurge of ultra-nationalist violence.
Images of rioting, fascist-minded thugs have dominated TV broadcasts.
The violence began following an ordinary conflict between two small groups of young people over a taxi.
One group consisted of young people from the Northern Caucasus, the other of fans of a Moscow football (soccer) club.
One of the leaders of the Moscow fans, Yegor Sviridov, was murdered.
Rumors raced around the city the next day that the police had released all those accused of Sviridov’s murder (as it happens, the rumors were true).
Spontaneous protests erupted in front of police headquarters, but the police did not intervene.
On December 11, another rally was held at site of the murder, and moved into the very center of Moscow, Manezhnaya Square, just outside the Kremlin’s walls.
The crowd began to chant nationalist slogans, and then proceeded to beat up passersby who did not look Slavic.
The police were slow to arrive.
The beatings continued and spread to the subway, where the police were essentially powerless.
The night finished with many wounded and one more killed.
The next day, back on Manezhnaya Square, beside the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a huge swastika appeared.
These events are not without precedent.
In 2002, Moscow authorities mounted huge TV-screens on Manezhnaya Square to broadcast a World Cup match between Russia and Japan.
By the start of the game, tens of thousands of young fans were on the square, many of them drunk and agitated.
When the final whistle sounded on a 1-0 victory for Japan, the crowd, infuriated, burst into spontaneous pogroms and beatings.
Those events were preceded by a propaganda campaign in which government-controlled newspapers, television stations, and radio broadcasters took part.
It was decided to exploit the forthcoming world championship for “patriotic” purposes.
In pumping up football-induced hysteria, Russian politicians – headed by then-President Vladimir Putin – took the lead.
The government had erected the TV screens outside the Kremlin in order to ensure patriotic exultation of the victory that they assumed was coming.
No one was prepared for defeat.
Clearly, careless manipulation by the authorities of patriotic sentiments has proven to be a risky business in Russia.
But the Kremlin still seems addicted to this means of buttressing its legitimacy among ordinary Russians.
Indeed, the vast popular protests that took place during the “Orange Revolution” in Ukraine five years ago convinced the Kremlin that they could not allow any spontaneous outburst of public emotions.
Officials evidently decided that it is better to flirt with and control public passion than allow it to erupt on its own.
Back then, the Kremlin was frightened by the possibility of a so-called “color revolution” breaking out in Russia.
As a result, enormous resources – both funds and officials’ time – were invested in youth movements created by Kremlin puppeteers, with two aims: control street political activity and prepare brigades for a future struggle – which might include ballot rigging – against political opponents.
For this purpose, contingents of football fans were also used.
This sort of manipulation is now a Kremlin staple.
Indeed, by coincidence, on the Sunday the young football fan was murdered in Moscow, Vladislav Surkov, the first deputy in President Dmitri Medvedev’s administration, was meeting Michael McFaul of President Barack Obama’s National Security Council. That meeting was taking place as part of a gathering, led by Surkov, of Russian youth-movement activists.
One quote from Surkov that day is particularly telling: “Make ready for the elections, train your brains and muscles. You can always rely on our support.”
Those muscles were put to use outside the Kremlin walls that very day.
To understand what is at stake, it is sufficient to consider the name of the main youth movement fathered by the Kremlin: Nashi, or “Ours.”
It is difficult to invent a more potentially explosive moniker, for the name proudly proclaims a division between “us” and “them” – the most ancient and most destructive of human instincts. And it is hard to rationalize so atavistic an effort being initiated by a government and supported with taxpayers’ money.
As a result, special youth brigades fostered by the Kremlin nowadays beat up activists of “not ours.” If the policedetain Nashi members, a telephone call from the President’s administration follows, and the detainees are released.
That is why the police fail to take tough action against rioting young thugs.
Only when the Kremlin was seized by panic at the level of the disturbances that Nashi had initiated, did it demand that the police take control of events.
It is not clear yet whether the nationalist youth rebellion has been suppressed, and whether Muscovites will be able to use the subway without fear during Russia’s New Year and Orthodox Christmas holidays.
But it is absolutely certain that the Kremlin’s unconstitutional activities – its division of citizens into “ours” and aliens, and its flirtation with hard-core xenophobes – has led to serious social and political destabilization.
In a society with weakened immunity to extremism – and with an utterly dysfunctional government – the authorities are, perhaps literally, playing with fire.
From Global Imbalances to Effective Global Governance
STANFORD, CALIFORNIA – The current credit crisis has led to scaled-back projections for growth around the world.
Governments and central banks are responding to damaged balance sheets and credit lockups in an attempt to limit extreme harm to their economies outside the financial sector.
In the United States, the financial sector is undergoing a high-speed but permanent structural transformation, the effects of which could be severe for developing countries’ economic growth.
Indeed, these countries are already experiencing large relative price increases for food and oil, a food emergency for the poor, and higher rates of inflation induced by commodity price shifts.
While rapid growth in developing countries has been an important factor in the rising commodity prices, much of this is beyond their control.
For the past two years, my colleagues and I on the Growth Commission have sought to learn how 13 developing countries managed to record growth rates averaging 7% or more for 25 years or longer.
In The Growth Report , published in May, we tried to understand why most developing countries fell far short of this achievement, and explored how they might emulate the fast growers.
Sustained high growth is enabled by and requires engagement with the global economy that goes beyond simply being able to produce for a potentially massive export market.
It also involves, crucially, importing an essential intangible asset: knowledge.
Economies can learn faster than they can invent, so less developed countries can achieve much faster growth than was experienced by today’s industrialized countries when they were becoming wealthy.
Because of the importance of the global economy, the destiny of developing countries is not entirely in the hands of their leaders, workforces, and entrepreneurs.
Today, there are potential adverse global trends and challenges, many of which are relatively new developments that the 13 high-growth cases did not face.
The most immediate is financial distress emanating mainly, but not exclusively, from the US and spilling out to hit all sectors of the global economy.
This was and is the result of an asset bubble fueled by excessive leverage and by the massive transparency issues associated with complex securities and derivatives that were supposed to spread risk, but instead mainly increased the systemic risk already present with excess debt.
Much has become clear.
First, extreme financial distress can bring down the real economy, with a shortage of credit being the most potent channel.
Second, the current regulatory structure is not adequate to ensure stability in the US economy.
America’s light, incomplete, and fragmented pattern of regulation will not survive, and it will not be used as a model in other parts of the world.
Third, contributing factors included low interest rates, compressed risk spreads, and global imbalances that accommodated low savings in the US, consumption in excess of output, and a mounting trade deficit.
Absent the willingness of large developing countries to run trade surpluses and high savings rates relative to investment, the asset bubble in the US – leading to a rise in domestic consumption and a fall in the savings rate – would have triggered inflation and higher interest rates.
That would have put a partial brake on growth in asset prices, raised savings, reduced investment, and probably lowered the trade deficit. But the automatic stabilizers that normally kick in did not.
In general, automatic stabilizers may not kick in across the global economy, which means that policies need to be coordinated.
Fourth, regulatory structures will need to be rebuilt, and this will require a global effort.
Absent international coordination, the opportunities for destructive regulatory competition will defeat regulatory reform.
Finally, both the interdependence and global risk that are evident in this crisis will and probably should cause countries to adopt policies with respect to financial structures that provide for some insulation from external shocks, even if such policies impose a cost.
The interdependencies in the global economy (in areas as diverse as financial markets, product safety, infectious diseases, natural resource dependency, and global warming) have outrun our collective capacity to manage them and coordinate policy responses.
Restoring that balance will take time, leadership, a shift in attitudes, and creativity.
In the interim, the mismatch creates risks for everyone, including developing countries.
It creates skepticism about whether the net benefits of openness are positive, and uncertainty about what adaptations are needed in the regulation of free markets to achieve a reasonable balance between their benefits and risks.
Influential developing countries share a joint responsibility with the G-8 for the stability of the global financial and economic systems.
But they currently have limited channels for discharging that responsibility and influencing global policies.
In addition, collectively we must do a better job of anticipating problems rather than being in reactive mode in the face of crises.
The global economy and its increasing openness made it possible for three billion people to enjoy the fruits of growth in the postwar period.
It may also provide an economic springboard for another two billion people to fulfill their aspirations in the coming decades.
But openness brings risks, many unanticipated and most under-managed.
People are skeptical for understandable reasons, and in the case of the credit crisis, angry.
Openness needs protecting and the best way to protect it is to manage the areas of growing interdependence effectively, pragmatically and inclusively.
From Great Game to Grand Bargain
LAHORE – The “Great Game” is no fun anymore.
Nineteenth-century British imperialists used that term to describe the British-Russian struggle for mastery in Afghanistan and Central Asia.
More than a century later, the game continues.
But now, the number of players has exploded, those living on the chessboard have become players, and the intensity of the violence and the threats that it produces affect the entire globe.
Afghanistan has been at war for three decades, and that war is spreading to Pakistan and beyond.
A time-out needs to be called so that the players, including President-elect Barack Obama, can negotiate a new bargain for the region.
Securing Afghanistan and its region will require an international presence for many years.
Building up Afghanistan’s security forces is at most a stopgap measure, as the country cannot sustain forces of the size that it now needs.
Only a regional and global agreement to place Afghanistan’s stability above other objectives can make long-term stability possible by enabling Afghanistan to survive with security forces that it can afford.
Such agreement, however, will require political and diplomatic initiatives both inside and outside of the country.
In Afghanistan, the United States and NATO must make clear that they are at war with al-Qaeda and those who support its global objectives, but have no objection if either the Afghan or Pakistani government negotiates with insurgents who renounce ties to Osama bin Laden.
In exchange for such guarantees, international forces could largely withdraw, leaving a force to secure a political agreement and to train Afghan security forces.
But a political settlement within Afghanistan cannot succeed without a regional grand bargain.
The first Great Game was resolved a century ago by making Afghanistan a buffer state in which outsiders did not interfere.
Today, however, Afghanistan is the scene not only of the War on Terror, but also of longstanding Afghan-Pakistani disputes, the India-Pakistan conflict, domestic struggles in Pakistan, US-Iranian antagonism, Russian concerns about NATO, Sunni-Shia rivalry, and struggles over regional energy infrastructure.
These conflicts will continue as long as the US treats stabilizing Afghanistan as subordinate to other goals, accompanied by all the risks entailed by terrorist resurgence and a regional security crisis.
This is why Obama must adopt a bold diplomatic initiative that encompasses the entire region and help resolve longstanding disputes between Afghanistan’s neighbors.
Such an initiative must include a comprehensive regional aid and development package.
In addition, the US must rebalance its regional posture by reducing its dependence on Pakistan’s military.
Obama will need firmly to support Pakistan’s fragile elected government as it tries to gain control over the army and intelligence apparatus and thus reverse decades of support for militants.
Dialogue with Iran and Russia over common interests in Afghanistan – both helped the US in 2001 – would place more pressure on Pakistan.
At the same time, the US and other powers with a stake in Afghanistan must seek to reduce Indian activities in Afghanistan that Pakistan sees as threatening, or, if those policies are not threatening, assure greater transparency for them.
This objective requires more than “pressuring” Pakistan.
The Pakistani security establishment believes that it faces a US-Indian-Afghan alliance aimed at undermining Pakistani influence in Afghanistan and even dismembering the Pakistani state.
Civilian leaders evaluate Pakistan’s national interests differently, but they, too, cannot be indifferent to Pakistan’s chronic sense of insecurity.
Pakistan does not have border agreements with either India, with whom it disputes the incorporation of Kashmir, or Afghanistan, which has never explicitly recognized the Durand Line, the frontier between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Pakistan also claims that the Northern Alliance, part of the anti-Taliban resistance in Afghanistan, is working with India from within Afghanistan’s security services.
And the US-India nuclear deal effectively recognizes India’s legitimacy as a nuclear power while continuing to treat Pakistan, with its record of proliferation, as a pariah.
Pressure will not work if Pakistan’s leaders believe that their country’s survival is at stake.
Instead, the new US administration should help to create a broad multilateral framework for the region, one aimed at building a genuine consensus on the goal of achieving Afghan stability by addressing the legitimate sources of Pakistan’s insecurity while strengthening opposition to disruptive Pakistani behavior.
A first step could be establishing a contact group for the region, authorized by the United Nations Security Council.
This contact group could promote dialogue between India and Pakistan about their respective interests in Afghanistan and about finding a solution to the Kashmir dispute; seek a long-term political strategy from the Pakistani government for the future of the tribal agencies; move Afghanistan and Pakistan toward discussions on frontier issues, and promote a regional plan for economic development and integration.
China, the largest investor in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, could help finance projects of common interest.
A successful initiative will require exploratory talks and an evolving road map.
Today, such suggestions may seem audacious, naive, or impossible; but, without such audacity, there is little hope for Afghanistan, Pakistan, or the region as a whole.
From Hubris to Nemesis in the EU
Paris – The European Union’s Lisbon treaty was initially greeted with enthusiasm, pride, and even hubris.
It promised a more realistic and reasonable way forward than the ill-fated constitutional treaty that it replaced, and many of its supporters also hoped that a central feature of its predecessor – the notion of “constitutional patriotism” – was still alive.
But the Lisbon treaty has instead brought chaos to the Union.
What went wrong?
Constitutional patriotism, a concept developed by two German philosophers, Dolf Sternberger and Karl Jaspers, was intended to replace the nationalism that had been discredited in Germany by the country’s Nazi past.
Similarly, as the EU evolved into a federal state, its loyal citizens would reject nationalism based on ethnic affinities and instead identify with the democratic principles of the federation’s constitution.
This fantasy was unambiguously rejected by Irish voters, so it seems fitting to remind ourselves that the ancient Greeks, who gave the word “hubris” to the western world, saw it as a portent of tragedy leading to downfall, or “nemesis.”
Did the ambitions of the Lisbon treaty’s designers condemn it to failure?
And, indeed, has it really failed?
After all, European integration may meet obstacles, but it is still moving forward.
As France’s Robert Schuman, one of the EU’s founding fathers, said in 1950, “Europe will neither happen in one go, nor as a whole construct: it will happen through concrete achievements, first by creating a de facto solidarity.”
Many thought that this solidarity had been achieved in October 2004, with the signing of the Nice treaty, which outlined an EU constitution.
But only 18 member states then approved it, before France and the Netherlands rejected it in referenda and the seven other member states then halted the ratification process.
Faced with this situation, the European Council had only two choices.
First, it could stick with the Nice treaty as the basis of the Union’s operation.
But that admission of failure would have weakened the political dynamic of the European project and severely constrained its scope for the future.
The second option was to search for a compromise – the Lisbon treaty.
It bears repeating that the Lisbon treaty constitutes real, if modest, progress for the European project.
Under its terms, the European Council’s presidency would have far greater stability; in place of the current six-month rotating presidency, a European political leader who could command the necessary support would be elected to serve as President for two and a half years.
Council decisions that now require unanimity would be taken by majority vote.
The EU’s “high representative” would straddle the European Commission and the European Council to look after foreign affairs and security, and the European Parliament would have more power.
Over and above these considerable advances, the treaty aims to make the EU more democratic.
A group of citizens would be able to “invite” the European Commission to propose new legislation.
National parliaments would be given a say in EU lawmaking, as the treaty recognizes the roles of parliaments in the “adequate workings of the Union.”
Yet, despite its undeniable importance and its contribution to the EU’s development, the Lisbon treaty is far from being the key to everything.
Instead, it is a simplified treaty replete with protocols, dispensations, and opt-out causes.
Former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt was right when he spoke of the treaty as a set of “footnotes.”
Meanwhile, with the Lisbon treaty blocked and no institutional step forward in sight, the underlying question remains: What type of Europe do we want?
The Lisbon treaty is content with clearing pathways rather than creating new horizons.
It mainly gives member states’ leaders the responsibility of implementing various EU advances, and sketches only tantalizing glimpses of Europe’s full potential.
It doesn’t condemn the EU, but as French President Nicolas Sarkozy likes to say, it doesn’t save it, either.
The member states’ political authority remains the motor of European policymaking, with all that this implies in terms of coordination, compromise, and negotiation.
It is now up to the EU’s political leadership to move quickly and take firm grasp of the achievements that initially gave birth to the Lisbon treaty. A charter of fundamental rights has, for example, been integrated into the treaty; but, unless the member states bring it to life, it will certainly fail to yield concrete results.
Fair rather than free competition in trade is proposed, but what does this mean if member states are not able to reach consensus on how to make it happen?
A final point worth emphasizing is that the Lisbon treaty moves away from many of the ideas that could serve as the foundations of a European federal super-state.
The disappearance from the treaty of such terms as “constitution” and “minister of foreign affairs” clearly show that the constitutional treaty’s ambitions have been scaled back.
To move forward without Ireland by establishing a new Union with only 26 countries is legally impossible.
But starting a new cycle of institutional negotiations also seems improbable.
Europe’s citizens are tired of these recurrent discussions – since 1995, there have been treaties of Amsterdam, Nice, Rome, and Lisbon, none of which has entirely succeeded.
Some believe that we will ultimately find a compromise, some ruse to make the Irish succumb, that gives the EU a treaty.
But it will all take time, and if the new arrangement lacks a qualified majority vote, fails to reform the Commission, and includes an opt-out on the charter of fundamental rights, it will not resolve the EU’s essential problems or its estrangement from European public opinion.
Perhaps hubris has finally delivered nemesis in the form of a Union without people, where treaties have replaced the spirit of Europe.
From Karl Popper to Karl Rove – and Back
NEW YORK -- In his novel 1984 , George Orwell chillingly described a totalitarian regime in which all communica­tion is controlled by a Ministry of Truth and dissidents are persecuted by political police.
The United States remains a democracy governed by a constitution and the rule of law, with pluralistic media, yet there are disturbing signs that the propaganda methods Orwell described have taken root here.
Indeed, techniques of deception have undergone enormous improvements since Orwell’s time.
Many of these techniques were developed in connection with the advertising and marketing of commercial products and services, and then adapted to politics.
Their distinguishing fea­ture is that they can be bought for money.
More recently, cogni­tive science has helped to make the techniques of deception even more effective, giving rise to political professionals who concentrate only on “get­ting results.”
These professionals take pride in their ac­complishments, and may even enjoy the respect of an American public that admires success no matter how it is achieved.
That fact casts doubt on Karl Popper’s concept of open society, which is based on the recognition that, while perfect knowledge is unattainable, we can gain a better understanding of reality by engaging in critical thinking.
Popper failed to recognize that in democratic politics, gathering public support takes prece­dence over the pursuit of truth.
In other areas, such as science and industry, the impulse to impose one’s views on the world encounters the resistance of external reality.
But in politics the electorate’s perception of reality can be easily manipulated.
As a result, political discourse, even in democratic societies, does not necessarily lead to a better understanding of reality.
The reason democratic politics leads to manipulation is that politicians do not aspire to tell the truth.
They want to win elections, and the best way to do that is to skew reality to their own benefit.
This insight should lead us not to abandon the concept of open society, but to revise and reaffirm the case for it.
We must abandon Popper’s tacit assumption that political discourse aims at a better understanding of reality and reintroduce it as an explicit requirement.
The separation of powers, free speech, and free elections alone cannot ensure open society; a strong commitment to the pursuit of truth is also required.
We need to introduce new ground rules for political discourse.
These cannot be identi­cal to scientific method, but they should be similar in character, enshrining the pursuit of truth as the criteria on which political views are to be judged.
Politicians will respect, rather than manipulate, reality only if the public cares about the truth and punishes politicians when it catches them in deliber­ate deception.
And the public should care about the truth because deception misleads people in choosing their representatives, distorts policy choices, undermines ac­countability, and destroys trust in democracy.
Recent history provides convincing evidence that policies based on a misrepresenting reality backfire.
The Bush administration’s response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 – declaring a War on Terror and treating criticism as unpatriotic – succeeded in gathering public support, yet the results were the exact opposite to what the Bush administration intended, both for itself and the United States.
The practical difficulty is in recognizing when political profes­sionals are distorting reality.
There is an important role here for the media, the political elite, and the educational system, which must all act as watchdogs.
In addition, the public needs to be inoculated against the various tech­niques of deception.
The most ef­fective techniques operate at the subconscious level.
When emotions can be aroused by methods that bypass consciousness, the public is left largely defenseless.
But if the public is made aware of the various techniques, it is likely to reject them.
One influential technique – which Republican pollster Frank Luntz says that he learned from 1984 - simply reverses meanings and turns reality on its head.
Thus, Fox News calls itself “fair and balanced,” and Karl Rove and his acolytes turn their opponents’ strongest traits into their Achilles’ heels, using insinuations and lies to portray the opponents’ achievements as phony.
That is how insinuations of cowardice and foul play helped defeat two highly decorated Vietnam War veterans, Senator Max Cleland in 2002, and John Kerry in 2004, while Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney – both of whom avoided military service ­– were portrayed as true patriots.
Another technique is transference: accusing opponents of having motives or using methods that characterize the accuser himself.
For example, David Horowitz, who accuses me of being “the Lenin of the anti-American conspiracy,” is a former Trotskyite for whom opponents are never adversaries to be debated, but rather enemies to be crushed.
The American public has proven remarkably susceptible to the manipulation of truth, which increasingly dominates the country’s political discourse.
Indeed, a whole net­work of publications, some of which manage to parade as mainstream media, is devoted to the task.
Yet I believe that it is possible to inoculate the public against false arguments by arousing resent­ment against Orwellian Newspeak.
What is needed is a concerted effort to iden­tify the techniques of manipulation – and to name and shame those who use them.
Now is an ideal time to begin that effort.
Americans are now awakening, as if from a bad dream.
What we have learned from recent years’ experience – what we should have known all along – is that the supremacy of critical thought in political dis­course cannot be taken for granted.
It can be ensured only by an electorate that respects reality and punishes politicians who lie or engage in other forms of deception.
From Lady Di to Michelle Obama
NEW YORK– In one week, Michelle Obama sat for a formal White House portrait, dressed in somber, tailored clothes; posed for a snazzy People magazine cover, dressed in a slightly down-market, hot-pink lace outfit that showed plenty of skin; let the national media know that the First Family would be getting its new puppy from a rescue shelter; and had her press office mention casually that “secretaries and policy makers” had been invited for popcorn and movies at the White House.
That same week, in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the 1930’s, a national poll found that support for President Barack Obama was remarkably high, with respondents consistently saying that he “cares about people like me.”
These two phenomena are closely related.
Almost from her first appearance in the public eye, Michelle Obama has used clothing, etiquette, and such cues as where she shops and entertains to send out a subtle but radical message to American voters and to the world.
For the first time since the days of Andrew Jackson, the White House is aggressively “democratizing” the highest office in the land, and symbolically inviting in the common man – and now the common woman.
In other words, Mrs. Obama is managing to set herself up, unprecedentedly, as the “people’s First Lady.”
She has carefully studied not only Jackie Kennedy – a comparison obvious from her sheath dresses, boat collars, and page-boy haircut – but also the triumphs and failures of that other glamorous but underestimated stealth radical, Princess Diana.
Princess Di’s legacy in generating iconography that opened the way to tremendous social change is grossly underappreciated.
In her brief lifetime, she was often lauded for qualities (her beauty and style) that were secondary to her life’s work, and derided for other aspects of her character (her emotionality and chaotic personal life) that were equally beside the point.
As a result, few people noticed how genuinely, powerfully transformative her agenda was, how well she had thought it out, and how audaciously she sought to manage it.
Without a formal education, Diana self-consciously set about pushing open the doors of an encrusted monarchy, challenging the sanctities of a long-established class structure, and affirming the value and immediacy of a Britain that was more diverse and socially mobile than ever before.
Sometimes her efforts were heavy-handed, as when she embraced AIDS victims physically as a metaphor for social inclusion; sometimes they backfired, as when her shared intimacies with servants provided fodder for a flood of posthumous tell-all books.
But, again and again, by showing up for Elton John and not just for the ballet, or by taking her sons away from the hunting preserve of Balmoral to careen down a waterslide at a tacky amusement park, she told ordinary Britons that their world was as important as any other.
She told them that she wanted to know them, and that she wanted her sons to know them, too.
It was this radical popularizing/democratizing mission –�not her knowledge of her former husband’s secrets or her later intimate relationship with a Muslim – that made her such a threat to the British establishment.
And she was successful: she taught leaders that they would have to invite the people in – and treat them with basic respect – if they were to maintain their position.
So, what Michelle Obama is doing is not trivial.
It was not an earth-shattering policy revelation when she astutely followed reports of Sarah Palin’s $150,000 wardrobe by remarking casually on a late-night talk show that she was wearing a chain-store brand, and that “you can get lots of cute things online.”
But it was nonetheless a powerful statement, especially to women, that said: I am not Nancy Reagan, dressed in Galliano, living in a gated community; I am not Mrs. Clinton, disregarding such things because I must argue major cases or run states; I am you – busy, on a budget, overworked, shrewd, cute, clever, finding a way.
Likewise, her invitations to the White House are being used for populist messaging.
Who came over to watch the White House chef with Mrs. Obama?
Local cooking school students.
Who sang at a White House event?
Local public high school students.
Again, “secretaries and policy makers,” not “policy makers and secretaries,” are coming over for film night.
She is deliberately, coolly signaling that secretaries are just as good and important as policy makers, if not more so.
This is a guest list that says to an anxious electorate: I respect you, wherever you are on the socioeconomic scale.
Many White House speechwriters have used that rhetoric, but almost no First Ladies have walked the talk and passed the popcorn.
When I worked on messaging for Al Gore’s 2000 presidential campaign, I often argued with white, older, affluent, male advisers who cared intensely about what was said in the elite media but ignored the popular venues to which most Americans pay attention.
They had learned nothing from the right, whose candidates knew how powerful the right colors, clothing, imagery, and even lighting can be, and how strongly personal narratives – Ronald Reagan in riding boots, or George W. Bush in a flight suit – resonate with voters.
Meanwhile, the nerdy, wonky left kept issuing data points, policy summaries, and white papers –�and generally, since Clinton, kept losing – until a young couple showed up and understood that Americans don’t just read; they watch.
You can tell the nation more about your values by saying where you will seek a dog for your daughters than you can through reams of unread position papers.
At a time of crisis, the Obamas are sending a powerful message, and Mrs. Obama, as the female archetype who has picked up Princess Di’s dropped baton, is instrumental in crafting it: no matter who you are, how stressed, how broke, there is, figuratively speaking, a seat in the White House with your name on it.
From Middle Israel to Middle Palestine
Haifa – Americans speak of “Middle America” and Britons of “Middle England.” Both are near mythic places that supposedly embody the authentic character of the nation.
Israel, too, has its “Middle Israel,” but it is very different from the place that Americans and Britons describe.
Rather than being somewhat provincial, Middle Israel is educated, bilingual or multilingual, and extremely well connected to the wider world.
It has provided Israel with the high-tech success that it has enjoyed over the last decade.
Middle Israel is mostly secular, though it also includes the moderately religious.
It is liberal, and despises any sort of fanaticism, whether orthodox or nationalist.
It is based on a strong, legally entrenched (though never perfect) ethos of gender equality that has typified Zionism from its start.
Middle Israel is also gay-friendly and distinctly non-xenophobic.
It is mostly Jewish, though a young Arab professional class is now coming out of the universities and making its way – with difficulties – into the heartland of civil society.
And, lest we forget, Middle Israel is earning the money and paying the taxes that support a wide assortment of traditionalists, fundamentalists, chauvinists, and other extremists – Jewish and Muslim – from Gaza to Jerusalem to the West Bank.
This quiet majority is under-represented in the Knesset because its members steer clear of political careers.
It is far too large to be considered an elite.
It is not exclusively urban, and it includes people of different cultural origins.
It has a powerful common identity, shared memories, and a rich culture.
It is neither inward-looking nor atavistic.
Some Palestinians hope to become, one day, something like Middle Israel.
They, too, would like life, pragmatism, creativity, and even joy to gain the upper hand.
They, too, want moderation and modernity, if perhaps not full secularization, to prevail.
These Palestinians are Middle Israel’s natural allies.
Fed by a meager diet of media reporting and some coarse think-tank buzz, European and American friends often ask me why our universities are awash with self-hating, anti-Israel “post-Zionists.”
But they are not.
Post-Zionism is a much hyped phantom, a term flourished in the mid-1990’s, when it seemed that Israeli and Palestinian leaders were building a peace process.
In response, Israelis quickly developed their own “End of History” thesis, suggesting that soon Zionism would be a thing of the past, primarily because there would no longer be a need for any ideology to support what would be a normal modern state, at peace with its neighbors and with its past traumas.
Back then, historians and sociologists dug into Zionism supposed “sins” – for example, that Israel’s Arab citizens have never, to this day, enjoyed equal civil rights.
Others looked at crimes against Palestinians in the wake of our self-defensive War of Independence.
Many people denied these facts; many others looked them in the eye.
Those of us who were not post-Zionists, but liberal Zionists, were even proud of the way our society had entered this phase of self-inspection and self-critique.
The gravest problem for Middle Israel is the Palestinian predicament in the occupied West Bank and in deadlocked Gaza.
Our leaders, from Levy Eshkol (and much more so Golda Meir) to Yitzhak Shamir, erred gravely in not seizing the earliest opportunity to arrange a territorial separation and a horizon of sovereignty for the post-1967 Palestinians.
They erred gravely in allowing Jewish settlers to have their way on the Biblical mountaintops, while Middle Israel looked the other way.
They erred gravely – and this is less often recognized – in discouraging the moderate Palestinian middle class, many of whom have quit the occupied territories, leaving behind a generation of young, ignorant, hungry, and angry warriors.
But there is a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
It is geographical: a division of territory and a separation of homelands that involves painful but conceivable compromises on both sides.
Jerusalem will be divided, Palestinian refugees will not return to their ancestral homes, and Jewish settlements in the West Bank will, like their Gaza counterparts, be dismantled or (inconceivably) left to fend for themselves.
Of course, extremists will hate it.
By contrast, moderates – all moderates – will accept it, albeit unhappily.
If the moderates win, then a “Middle Palestine” will at last rise to prominence.
Paralleling Middle Israel, though perhaps not initially befriending it or liking it very much, this kind of Palestine will be the best news that the Middle East will have had for a long time.
For now, we in Middle Israel must curb our own extremists and hold out for the Palestinian moderates to prevail.
From Neoliberalism to No Liberalism?
WASHINGTON, DC – The era of free-market capitalism launched in the 1980’s by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan – often called “neoliberalism” by its opponents – is over.
This ideological wave has crashed with the ongoing financial market crisis, but its decline was a long time coming.
In the last few years, while American leaders continued to ride the neoliberal wave, much of the rest of the world was already standing on the shore.
Disenchantment with “neoliberal,” pro-market ideas began in developing countries that had once been their ardent admirers.
Latin American countries that embraced free-market policies in the 1990’s rejected them in the mid-2000’s, as a new wave of left-leaning leaders came to power.
Russia, which adopted market-oriented reforms in the 1990’s, moved to a managed form of state capitalism in the 2000’s with “oligarchs” forced to submit to state control.
As a result, the United States, the European Commission, and the multilateral development banks have become increasingly isolated in their efforts to advance free-market thought and policies worldwide.
The deepening financial crisis weakens their position further.
After all, how can the US or the Western multilateral institutions advocate bank privatization now?
The decline of free-market orthodoxy in the rest of the world was caused by two factors: its failures as an approach to economic policy and the decline of US prestige and “soft power.”
“Neoliberalism” grew in popularity as a result of its successes in jump-starting economic growth in the US, the United Kingdom, and some developing countries in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
However, its weaknesses also became apparent during the mid- to late-1990’s.
The attempt to implant free-market philosophy in Russia, for instance, proved catastrophic.
Whereas the Russian experience clearly demonstrated the importance of strong state institutions in regulating a market economy, the free-market model’s fierce ideological opposition to a large state role in the economy offered a poor guide to building them.
After some successes, most notably in Chile, “neoliberal” advice in Latin America also failed, most dramatically in the case of Argentina’s currency board, but most damagingly by increasing inequality, which worsened the continent’s central political-economic problem.
In Brazil, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva showed that significant departures from free-market prescriptions worked better.
Worldwide, most of the high-growth countries of the 1990’s and 2000’s broke with free-market orthodoxy by maintaining a stronger state hand in the economy.
Belief in “neoliberalism” also was based on the success of the US economy, which for much of the 1990’s seemed to demonstrate the superiority of free markets.
But the rapid decline of US prestige and “soft power” during the 2000’s sowed doubt outside the US.
As the global agenda shifted to concerns about global warming, inequality, and the stability of the international system, the US no longer seemed to be a shining example, but rather an immovable obstacle on many of these issues.
America’s elites turned a blind eye to these developments, rejecting all criticism, together with the crude anti-Americanism with which it was often expressed.
Today, the story is different.
A massive reassessment is finally in progress, with US elites now recognizing that market capitalism is in crisis, and that the world will not blindly follow their lead.
But that leaves some large questions unresolved.
If “neoliberalism” has failed, what comes next?
And what must the US do to regain its stature and influence in the international economy?
As New York and London lose their undisputed claim to being the world’s financial capitals, the rising centers of the global economy will gain an increasing say in international economic policy.
Most, if not all, are located in countries that have a stronger tradition of state involvement in the economy.
Jeffrey Garten, the dean of Yale’s School of Management, got it right when he labeled this the era of “state capitalism.”
The state is on its way back as an economic player – not least in the US.
But is that a good thing?
While many critics will be tempted to celebrate the end of “neoliberalism,” it remains to be seen whether or not what succeeds it represents an improvement.
Various forms of statism have been tried before; all have been found lacking.
After all, while “neoliberalism” was criticized as technocratic and elitist, it was nonetheless a form of liberalism, and it was also consistent with the spread of democratic governance worldwide.
The new era may not be so propitious for political liberties.
As rising authoritarian powers, China or Russia, for example, have no reason to use their growing international influence to promote democracy; on the contrary, they increasingly counterbalance the efforts of Western countries to promote political liberty.
As statist models of economic development become more appealing, democratic governance will become less so.
Nor is it clear that “state capitalism” can generate the same degree of innovation and entrepreneurship as the liberal models did in their prime.
In order to redeem the liberal project, American and European leaders will need to reformulate it in such a way that it can provide convincing solutions to problems such as environmental degradation and economic inequality.
This will be no easy task, and one that may be far from policymakers’ minds as they grapple with the current crisis.
But, unless they do, the emphasis on economic and political freedom that lies at the heart of liberalism may not survive.
From Oil to Information
Sheikh Yamani, Saudi Arabia’s former oil minister and a founding architect of OPEC, once said, “The stone age came to an end not for a lack of stones, and the oil age will end, but not for a lack of oil.”
Humans stopped using stone because bronze and iron were superior materials.
But will we really stop using oil when other energy technologies similarly provide superior benefits?
The threat of depleting the world’s scarce energy resources has maintained a powerful hold on popular thinking ever since the oil shocks of the 1970’s.
Nor is our fear limited to oil.
For example, the classic 1972 bestseller Limits to Growth predicted that the world would run out of gold in 1981, silver and mercury in 1985, and zinc in 1990.
We have the benefit of hindsight today, but even now most discussions of the issue are predicated on the logic of Limits to Growth .
Moreover, the issue is not merely that we have not run out of natural resources.
The American economist Julian Simon allegedly issued a challenge in 1980 to a group of environmentalists, saying that if scarcity were to be measured in terms of higher prices, they should invest in stocks of any raw metal.
The environmentalists put their money on chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten, and picked a time frame of 10 years.
By September 1990, each of the metals had dropped in price: chromium by 5%, tin by a whopping 74%.
The doom-mongers lost.
More importantly, they could not have won even if they had invested in petroleum, foodstuffs, sugar, coffee, cotton, wool, minerals, or phosphates: all of these commodities had become cheaper.
Today, oil is the most important and valuable internationally traded commodity, and its significance to our civilization is underscored by the recurrent worry that we are running out of it.
However, statistical estimates of its depletion hide much more than they reveal.
A typical oilfield yields only 20% of the reservoir, with close to 63% remaining buried in the earth even when the most advanced technologies are used.
Moreover, economists contend that energy consumption per capita is declining, owing to more efficient use.
Fuel efficiencies in the automotive sector have increased by more than 60% in the past three decades, while overall wealth produced per unit of energy has doubled during the same period.
But, whereas metal prices have fallen, oil prices are reaching record highs.
The reason is simple: metal usage has been substituted by many alternatives, but most still require petroleum products as inputs, and decades-long efforts to develop sufficient alternative energy sources have yielded little success.
So, if oil substitutes are not easily available, modern societies should focus on the sources of demand, most of which is attributable to the transport sector.
Indeed, more than 80% of modern societies’ consumption of energy generated by oil, either in the form of electricity or fuel, is used to move commuters.
Is all of this oil consumption really necessary?
With the rising contribution of services to global GDP, now is the time to reassess the need for travel to work.
Service-sector workers commute daily, only to be present in an environment that has no economic need for them, for they are facilitating information exchange far more than exchange of physical goods.
Do we really need to bring together so many people for so little gain and at such a high cost?
The cost is not merely in terms of natural resources, which should be sustained and passed on to future generations, not exhausted by our own.
The rise in the amount of time spent commuting is a drag on both national productivity and the quality of life in modern cities.
A survey conducted in the Indian city of Mumbai revealed that railway commuters’ average daily journey was 22 kilometers, while rapid urbanization there and in much of the developing world is only likely to increase the length of commutes.
Likewise, passenger air transport is dominated by business travel.
But, given the high-speed data transmission capacities of current telecommunications and information technology, it is now possible to reduce business travel significantly.
Whereas the outsourcing phenomenon is attenuating the need for labor migration, domestic migration can be limited further by the use of home offices, which can eventually reduce stress on real estate, public transport networks, roads, and airports.
Indeed, human travel in general should become increasingly limited to tourism and pleasure trips.
We now have the technological infrastructure to bring most job-related information to workers while allowing them to collaborate closely.
This requires a lifestyle change – one that governments should begin encouraging employers and workers to embrace.
If they do, the age of oil will not end.
But the age of worrying about it just might.
From Opportunity to Reality in the Middle East
It has been a long time since the words “opportunity” and “Middle East” appeared in the same sentence.
But now they are.
Even better, this optimism may have some basis in reality.
One important reason for this change in attitude is, of course, Yasir Arafat’s disappearance from the scene.
Like the Thane of Cawdor in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, “Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it.”
Arafat never grew beyond the man who appeared at the United Nations decades ago with both an olive branch and a gun.
His unwillingness to jettison terror and choose diplomacy proved his undoing, as he lost legitimacy in the eyes of both Israel and the United States.
The result was the failure to create a Palestinian state.
But it is not simply Arafat’s passing that provides cause for optimism.
We now have a Palestinian leadership legitimized by elections, one that appears to be opposed to using terrorism as a tool to achieve political aims.
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) has a good record of questioning the wisdom of the intifada that has taken too many lives and caused only misery and destruction on all sides of this enduring conflict.
Changes in Israel are also contributing to the mood swing.
There is a growing awareness in Israel that the current situation – one of open-ended Israeli occupation of lands mostly populated by Palestinians – is inconsistent with Israel’s determination to remain a secure, prosperous, Jewish, and democratic state.
The formation of a new Israeli government, one more centrist in its composition and support, is another positive development.
Israel is now led by a prime minister who has the ability to make historic choices and a government inclined to support him.
But opportunity is just that.
Middle East history is replete with examples of missed and lost chances to make peace.
The challenge now is to break this pattern and turn today’s opportunity into reality.
This requires that the promised Israeli disengagement from Gaza and parts of the West Bank succeed.
But “success” entails more than departing Israelis. It also requires that Palestinians demonstrate that they can govern responsibly and that they can put an end to terrorist violence emanating from Palestinian soil.
What happens in Gaza after Israel leaves will have a profound impact on Israeli politics.
If Gaza turns into a lawless failed state, one that is a base for attacks on Israelis, it will be extremely difficult to persuade Israel to withdraw from other areas that it now occupies.
But if Palestinians in Gaza demonstrate that they can rule themselves and be a good neighbor, a key justification for Israel’s continuing occupation elsewhere will weaken.
Palestinians will need help if things are to turn out right in Gaza.
The US, Europe, and Arab states such as Egypt, along with Russia and the UN, all have a responsibility to assist Abu Mazen.
Palestinians need financial and technical help to build up a unified and capable security establishment, to revive a moribund economy, and to build a modern, transparent political system.
It is also important that the Gaza withdrawal be a beginning, not an end, to the political process.
There must be a link between what takes place in Gaza and a comprehensive settlement to the Palestinian question if Mazen is to persuade a majority of his people that diplomacy and compromise deliver more than violence and confrontation.
Here, too, there is an important role for America to play.
In fact, the US has already begun to do what is required.
In a September 2004 letter to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, President George W. Bush reassured Israelis that it was “unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949.”
The framework for a solution to the Palestinian refugee issue “will need to be found through the establishment of a Palestinian state, and the settling of Palestinian refugees there, rather than in Israel.”
These promises meant a great deal to Sharon as he faced domestic political challenges.
What is needed now is a parallel letter from Bush to Abu Mazen.
Such a letter could spell out the US commitment to a viable, contiguous, sovereign, and independent Palestinian state based on the 1967 lines, with compensation provided by Israel wherever territorial adjustments are agreed.
The US would also commit itself to provide resources to help construct a modern society and economy.
Help would also be extended to settle the Palestinian refugees, whether in Palestine, other Arab countries, or, in special cases where Israel agrees for humanitarian reasons, in Israel itself.
In return, Palestinians would need to pledge to reject the use of violence and terror once and for all.
The US should not, however, make the establishment of a full Palestinian democracy a prerequisite for territorial return and peace.
To delay negotiations until Palestinian democracy matured would only persuade Palestinians that diplomacy was a ruse and give many a reason to turn to violence.
After more than a half-century of Israeli-Palestinian conflict, translating opportunity into reality will be difficult enough without introducing new requirements that, however desirable, are not essential.
From People Power to Putin Power
As I attended a small but dignified memorial ceremony in Paris last week in honor of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya – a woman “brave beyond limits,” in the words of her French editor – I was reminded of another posthumous tribute I participated in nearly 17 years ago in Moscow.
Unlike Politkovskaya, the great scientist and human right activist Andrei Sakharov had not been murdered, and the tribute given to him then looked like the celebration of a new era.
A new page was being turned, one that was full of uncertainty but also of hope that Russia was on its way to becoming a “normal country.”
It is this page that has been probably fully closed with the assassination of Politkovskaya.
What the small crowd of intellectuals gathered in Paris was mourning was their hope for a different Russia.
We were burying the collective dream of intellectuals and democrats for a Russia where freedom and the rule of law would, after a long and cold Soviet winter, take root and bloom.
The portraits of Politkovskaya, like a multitude of mirrors, were calling us back to a much darker reality.
The dream was over.
It had, most likely, never been realizable.
What we are witnessing today is a totally different story.
Russia is literally buying its way back into the international system as a preeminent actor, one that is regaining power and clout by replacing nuclear weapons with oil and gas and substituting greed for fear.
The balance of terror of the Soviet era has given way to unilateral energy dependency in favor of Russia.
With their enormous cash flow, Russian billionaires are buying sumptuous properties all over the world, and Russia is buying prominent Germans like the former Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, if not the support of Germany as such.
Whatever the enormous differences that may separate them, post-communist Russia and fundamentalist Iran have much in common.
Energy wealth gives them a sense of unique opportunity, the conviction that time is playing in their favor, and that they can now redress the humiliations they have suffered from the outside world.
It is as if they were combining the Arab/Islamic world’s culture of humiliation and Asia’s culture of hope.
Both are marked by a defiant nationalism, and both feel irresistible, all the more so because they sense that the United States is in decline as a result of the quagmire in Iraq, if not in Afghanistan as well.
Of course, the differences between Russia and Iran are enormous.
The Iranian regime is highly ideological and animated by an open passion to destroy Israel.
It does not enjoy the massive backing of its society, except when it comes to national pride and the quest for nuclear status.
Russia’s regime, by contrast, is animated by money, not ideology.
In its quest to rebuild Russia’s geopolitical power and influence, Presdient Vladimir Putin has the support of the immense majority of the population.
His motto, “Get rich and keep quiet,” sounds like Guizot’s priorities in mid-nineteenth century France, even if it is “seasoned” with a strong touch of imperial pride.
As long as the oil money keeps flowing, most Russians will express no nostalgia for the democratic opening of the Yeltsin years, with its accompanying combination of chaos, corruption, international weakness, and disrespect for the state.
Are Russians so different from us in the western democratic world, or is democracy a luxury that only old, stable, prosperous, and satisfied societies can afford?
In their quest for post-Soviet stability, Russians seem to have found reassurance in Putin.
He does not match Peter the Great in physical stature, but he has proven to be a gifted politician, capable of grasping, then controlling, the mood of the Russian people.
For a majority of Russian citizens, economic prosperity and televised entertainment have become the modern equivalent of the panem et circenses formula of Roman times.
The war in Chechnya may contribute to the moral corruption of Russia as a whole, to its frightening descent into a culture of violence.
But it is also feeding a patriotic emotion – a popular longing for the restoration of Russia’s imperial status and prestige – that Putin’s regime has shrewdly exploited.
Meanwhile, ordinary Russians have gained little.
The multiplication of assassinations of political opponents and economic rivals, the mafia practice of contract murders, cannot be seen as signs of a regained stability.
Nor can the Putin regime’s manipulation of popular xenophobia against citizens of the former Soviet empire, such as Georgians.
Russia may have recovered its status as a strong power, but is it a respected, or even a happy one?
Russia is rich, but Russians, at least most of them, remain poor, with a life expectancy that is closer to Africa than to Western Europe.
Eventually, they will have to recognize that modern nations cannot live by power alone.
From Prague Spring to Velvet Revolution
WARSAW – What was the Prague Spring, or the events of 1968 more generally?
Their meaning, it seems, has become more, not less, debatable with the passage of time.
My generation was forged by protests and police truncheons, by the hopes generated not only by the Prague Spring, but also by the Polish student movement that March, the Paris events of May, and the first signs of Russian democracy voiced in the early books of Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn.
For those of us imprisoned in Poland, the Prague Spring was a harbinger of hope.
Even Poland’s communist newspapers, read behind bars, somehow conveyed news of the great changes taking place in our neighbor to the south.
So I remember my shock when I learned about the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August, and the trauma that lingered long after.
On the tenth anniversary of that invasion, Václav Havel, Jacek Kuron, and I, along with other dissidents, met on the Czech-Polish border.
There is a photograph of that occasion: future presidents, ministers, and parliamentarians who were at that time pursued by the police like common criminals.
These encounters were an extension of the climate of the Prague Spring.
We all felt that we were creating something new, something that might, one day, turn out to be an important component of democracy in our countries.
And so it was.
In August 1989, I proposed in the Polish Diet a draft resolution apologizing to the Czechs and Slovaks for Polish involvement in the 1968 invasion.
I felt that a historical circle was being closed: the ideas of the Polish March and the Prague Spring, the ideas of our mountain meetings, were becoming political facts.
Three months later, the Velvet Revolution began in Prague.
The main difference between the Prague Spring and the Velvet Revolution was that the former was mostly the work of Communist Party members and others who wanted to bring about “socialism with a human face.”
As a result, some people nowadays dismiss the Prague Spring as a power struggle between communists.
But there were many roads to – and through – communism, and many of them converged with national traditions.
Indeed, communism was attractive for many reasons, including the idea of universal justice and humanized social relations; a response to the great spiritual crisis after World War I and, later, to the Nazis’ genocide; and the conviction that Western dominance of the world was nearing its end.
Finally, in a world divided by Yalta, communism was, for some, the only realistic choice for central Europe.
In Czechoslovakia in 1968, communist reformers appealed to democratic ideals that were deeply rooted in the country’s pre-World War II past.
Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the Czechoslovak communists and the symbol of the Prague Spring, personified hope for democratic evolution, real pluralism, and a peaceful way to a state governed by law and respectful of human rights.
By contrast, in Poland, which had witnessed its own tentative opening in the March student movement, a nationalist-authoritarian faction exploited all that was intolerant and ignorant in Polish tradition, employing xenophobia and anti-intellectual rhetoric.
Polish Interior Minister Mieczyslaw Moczar, the leader of the nationalist faction, combined communist rhetoric with a language proper to fascist movements in order to mobilize the masses against the “cosmopolitan-liberal intelligentsia.”
The Polish freedom movement of 1968 lost its confrontation with police violence; the Prague Spring was crushed by the armies of five Warsaw Pact members.
But in both countries, 1968 gave birth to a new political consciousness.
The Polish and Czech opposition movements that emerged only a few years later had their roots in the events of 1968.
The Prague Spring was provoked by a crisis in the Communist Party, but the claim that it was merely a result of political squabbles among Party members falsifies history and rejects a significant fragment of the national heritage.
Attitudes towards communism were always a controversial subject for the anticommunist opposition.
Some rejected communism in all its forms.
The majority though, in one way or another, had some contact with communism, through intellectual fascination, participation in state institutions, or the cold conviction that only by accepting the reality of life under communism could one do something useful for one’s country.
These people, “tainted by communism,” constituted the majority of the participants in all revolts against the communist dictatorships.
There was, however, another, category of people: the “careful and untainted,” who absented themselves from the world of politics.
They hated communism, but, convinced that the system could not be reformed, they avoided the democratic opposition.
While others took risks or sat in jails, they functioned in official and legal structures.
One should not blame anyone today for such behavior.
But it is surprising when these people accuse participants in the Prague Spring and the democratic opposition of links with communism.
Communism was obviously an instrument of Soviet domination over conquered societies, but it was also a modus vivendi for large parts of these nations under the conditions in which they were obliged to live.
Imre Nagy, the leader of the Hungarian revolt in 1956, and Dubcek became parts of their national legends, which belies the claim that communism was exclusively a foreign imposition.
The Prague Spring appealed to elementary values: freedom, pluralism, tolerance, sovereignty, and rejection of the dictates of communist orthodoxy.
When I recall these events after 40 years, I see not only revolt, but also the great illusion that it might be possible to outfox the Kremlin and painlessly move society from communism to democracy.
This belief was naïve, but it also underpinned a national awakening in which the potential for freedom found its voice.
From Resource Curse to Blessing
KAMPALA – New discoveries of natural resources in several African countries – including Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania, and Mozambique – raise an important question: Will these windfalls be a blessing that brings prosperity and hope, or a political and economic curse, as has been the case in so many countries?
On average, resource-rich countries have done even more poorly than countries without resources.
They have grown more slowly, and with greater inequality – just the opposite of what one would expect.
After all, taxing natural resources at high rates will not cause them to disappear, which means that countries whose major source of revenue is natural resources can use them to finance education, health care, development, and redistribution.
A large literature in economics and political science has developed to explain this “resource curse,”and civil-society groups (such as Revenue Watch and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative) have been established to try to counter it.
Three of the curse’s economic ingredients are well known:
Moreover, resource-rich countries often do not pursue sustainable growth strategies.
They fail to recognize that if they do not reinvest their resource wealth into productive investments above ground, they are actually becoming poorer.
Political dysfunction exacerbates the problem, as conflict over access to resource rents gives rise to corrupt and undemocratic governments.
There are well known antidotes to each of these problems: a low exchange rate, a stabilization fund, careful investment of resource revenues (including in the country’s people), a ban on borrowing, and transparency (so citizens can at least see the money coming in and going out).
But there is a growing consensus that these measures, while necessary, are insufficient.
Newly enriched countries need to take several more steps in order to increase the likelihood of a “resource blessing.”
First, these countries must do more to ensure that their citizens get the full value of the resources.
There is an unavoidable conflict of interest between (usually foreign) natural-resource companies and host countries: the former want to minimize what they pay, while the latter need to maximize it.
Well designed, competitive, transparent auctions can generate much more revenue than sweetheart deals.
Contracts, too, should be transparent, and should ensure that if prices soar – as they have repeatedly – the windfall gain does not go only to the company.
Unfortunately, many countries have already signed bad contracts that give a disproportionate share of the resources’ value to private foreign companies.
But there is a simple answer: renegotiate; if that is impossible, impose a windfall-profit tax.
All over the world, countries have been doing this.
Of course, natural-resource companies will push back, emphasize the sanctity of contracts, and threaten to leave.
But the outcome is typically otherwise.
A fair renegotiation can be the basis of a better long-term relationship.
Botswana's renegotiations of such contracts laid the foundations of its remarkable growth for the last four decades.
Moreover, it is not only developing countries, such as Bolivia and Venezuela, that renegotiate; developed countries like Israel and Australia have done so as well.
Even the United States has imposed a windfall-profits tax.
Equally important, the money gained through natural resources must be used to promote development.
The old colonial powers regarded Africa simply as a place from which to extract resources.
Some of the new purchasers have a similar attitude.
Infrastructure (roads, railroads, and ports) has been built with one goal in mind: getting the resources out of the country at as low a price as possible, with no effort to process the resources in the country, let alone to develop local industries based on them.
Real development requires exploring all possible linkages: training local workers, developing small and medium-size enterprises to provide inputs for mining operations and oil and gas companies, domestic processing, and integrating the natural resources into the country’s economic structure.
Of course, today, these countries may not have a comparative advantage in many of these activities, and some will argue that countries should stick to their strengths.
From this perspective, these countries’ comparative advantage is having other countries exploit their resources.
That is wrong.
What matters is dynamic comparative advantage, or comparative advantage in the long run, which can be shaped.
Forty years ago, South Korea had a comparative advantage in growing rice.
Had it stuck to that strength, it would not be the industrial giant that it is today.
It might be the world’s most efficient rice grower, but it would still be poor.
Companies will tell Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania, and Mozambique to act quickly, but there is good reason for them to move more deliberately.
The resources will not disappear, and commodity prices have been rising.
In the meantime, these countries can put in place the institutions, policies, and laws needed to ensure that the resources benefit all of their citizens.
Resources should be a blessing, not a curse.
They can be, but it will not happen on its own. And it will not happen easily.
From Rome to Moscow
One of the late Pope John Paul II’s unfulfilled dreams was to visit Moscow and forge a rapprochement with the Orthodox Church.
But, although he was invited to Moscow by Russia’s three most recent presidents – Vladimir Putin, Boris Yeltsin, and Mikhail Gorbachev – opposition to the visit by Orthodox Patriarch Alexi prevented the Pope from making the journey before he died.
Will Pope Benedict XVI achieve the breakthrough that his friend and predecessor failed to realize?
Despite the recent return to Russia of the icon of Our Lady of Kazan that once hung in John Paul’s bedroom, relations between the Vatican and the Patriarchate remain strained.
So Putin, who usually seems omnipotent, remains wary of issuing an invitation to Pope Benedict.
That wariness is reinforced by a new political factor: a defense of Orthodoxy has become a pillar of the national idea on which Putin seeks to base the legitimacy of his regime.
This is one reason why Putin was one of the few leading heads of state to miss attending Pope John Paul’s funeral.
Although the Orthodox Church did send a delegation, immediately after the funeral Patriarch Alexi warned that the disagreements between the two branches of Christianity go much deeper than the former Pope’s Polish nationality, which was always a particular sore spot for Russian Orthodox Slavs.
Russians saw John Paul’s Polish nationality as linking him to a long history of perceived oppression of Russian Orthodoxy.
No less a figure than Alexander Pushkin wrote in 1836 that “Orthodoxy has always been persecuted by Catholic fanaticism….Their missionaries cursed the Orthodox Church, with hypocrisy and threats tried to recruit into Catholicism not only ordinary people but Orthodox priests as well.”
Those Russians who continue to view the Catholic Church as a threat regularly quote these lines.
Pope Benedict, being from Germany, a predominantly Protestant country, does not carry the weight of this bitter history.
Perhaps this is one reason why Alexi responded positively to Benedict’s first speech urging reconciliation, saying that he hopes that this will improve “Orthodox-Catholic relations on the post-Soviet territory.”
This positive spirit can be nurtured by Russia’s government, which usually has cordial relations with the Vatican.
Indeed, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has many projects for which he thinks the Vatican can be of help, particularly in advancing the cause of reconciliation and creating a “partnership between civilizations.”
Recently, another key Vatican figure, Cardinal Walter Casper, the head of the Council for Christian Unity, called for a Catholic-Orthodox high level meeting that would address unifying both branches of Christianity.
Cardinal Casper is well regarded in Russia for being the man who returned Our Lady of Kazan to its homeland.
In his public speeches, Casper more than once suggested that the Vatican considers Christian unification its main goal, and – most important from the Orthodox perspective -- that “unity does not have to mean sameness.”
The fact that Pope Benedict and Cardinal Casper are both Germans is important, because Russian-German relations are perhaps warmer now than they have ever been.
Putin, in particular, is at home in the German language, having spent many years in East Germany during his days as a KGB agent.
Moreover, unlike Pope John Paul II, who, as a Pole, always saw communist Russia as an oppressor, Benedict carries the German sense of guilt stemming from the country’s Nazi past and its brutal invasion of Russia.
In both Rome and Moscow, there is growing hope that a road to Christian unity can be built, but it is increasingly clear that the road can be completed only by passing through Berlin.
From Shock Therapy to Sleep Therapy
If the 1990’s was the era of economic shock therapy, the present decade may be remembered for economic reform paralysis.
Although the reasons for gridlock differ across countries, the bottom line is that few politicians anywhere are having much success in limbering up their economies.
The problem is not just in emerging markets such as Indonesia, Mexico, and Brazil, where an ascendant left has failed to find a viable alternative to the much reviled “Washington Consensus” of economic liberalization.
One sees the same phenomenon across many rich countries as well.
In a remarkable coincidence of timing, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called for early elections in the hope of energizing reform.
In Germany, the most urgent needs are for tax and labor-market reform. In Japan, the Koizumi government wants to privatize the behemoth postal service, whose giant financial arm is wrapped like a python around the country’s banking system.
Even in the United States, one of the few places where economic liberalization is not a dirty word, President George W. Bush has his own frustrations.
Despite a huge investment of time and energy, he has failed to marshal even his own troops in support of a relatively modest proposal to stave off collapse of the nation’s old-age insurance program.
Indeed, Bush’s popularity has taken a beating over pension reform.
Some people ascribe the global collapse of reform efforts to a peculiarly ineffective collection of leaders.
This view is nonsense, and besides, if the public is so unhappy with its leaders’ performance, why does it keep electing and re-electing them?
No, the problems run deeper.
The fact is that people everywhere are having trouble coming to terms with the rapid changes resulting from technology and globalization.
For, although globalization spins off a lot more winners than losers, many people are worried, and worried people press their leaders to slow things down.
You can tell Americans and Europeans that they should rejoice over the boundless cheap goods and cheap credit that trade with Asia has supplied. But all their politicians seem to worry about is how some farmer or textile worker may lose their job.
You can tell Latin Americans or Africans that Asia’s unquenchable thirst for natural resources will keep pushing up the prices of their commodity and agricultural exports in perpetuity, turning wheat fields into gold mines.
But all their politicians seem to want to worry about is protecting doomed domestic manufacturers against low-wage Asian competition.
Outgoing US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan preaches flexibility as a way of dealing with globalization.
At some level, of course, he is right.
Today’s world is one of fast-changing currents, where a region flourishes one day, and the next its factories collapse economically as if hit by hurricane Katrina.
If change is inevitable, we must make our economies more flexible and prepare to live with the consequences.
There is no other way.
So why doesn’t the public accept this need for flexibility, which, in the end, is what market-based economic liberalization is all about?
The problem is that most people are not thrilled to live in a world of blindingly fast change.
Most people are creatures of habit; they crave predictability.
German workers who make high-end machine tools are proud of their craft, and they don’t want to be told that the same work can be done for much less in Poland and Slovakia.
Clothing makers in Italy have long been the envy of the world.
These craftsmen don’t want to be told that they should start retraining as tour guides to service the inevitable horde of middle-income Chinese tourists, as that country takes over high-end light manufacturing like tailoring.
With such resistance to change, it is no wonder that so many political leaders try to lull their subjects to sleep, hoping that when everyone wakes up, it will all have proven a dream.
Asia, of course, is different.
China is developing at a dizzying pace.
Whole cities are rising out of desert sands overnight.
China is building more roads, airports, and bridges every five years than Europe and the US combined build in 20.
With a long history of cataclysmic, often violent change, Chinese society is perhaps more adaptable than most.
In India, which is said to have “a strong consensus for weak reform,” things are moving far more slowly – but always forward.
Whereas India is not yet nearly the factor in global trade that China has become, its 1.2 billion people are pushing inexorably onto the scene.
Will today’s reform paralysis outside Asia continue?
Will the political winds shift to reinvigorate economic liberalization, with politicians reminiscent of Britain’s Margaret Thatcher or the US’s Ronald Reagan coming to the fore, breathing the fire of change?
Will politicians finally tell their citizens that if their economies continue to sleep, they may not wake up?
I believe that in most countries, the era of sleep therapy will come to an early end.
But I fear that change might cause a global economic crisis resulting from, say, an ugly unwinding of extravagant US borrowing trends.
Only then may people start waking up and voting for politicians who insist on re-energizing economic reform.
From Solidarity to Freedom
Although the rise 25 years ago of Solidarity, the first independent civic movement in the former Soviet empire, had huge political consequences, Solidarity was, primarily, neither a political movement nor a labor union.
First and foremost, Solidarity was a cry of dignity.
We simply had reached the end of our endurance with the omnipresent and all-powerful communist apparatchiks who ruled in our workplaces, neighborhoods, even places of rest.
Writers, journalists, and artists could no longer stand the heavy-handed censorship and supervision.
In factories as well, Party bureaucrats wanted to know everything and decide everything.
Every civic initiative, every activity of any kind was subject to ideological evaluation and control.
All who were tempted to disobey were certain to be “taken care of” by the secret police.
Last winter, I saw a similar cry for dignity in Ukraine.
Those hundreds of thousands of people who camped for weeks on the freezing streets of Kiev did so because they were demanding their dignity.
Both the Polish and the Ukrainian experiences have convinced me that the will to live in dignity is the most powerful engine of human action, an engine that is capable of overcoming even the greatest fear.
But the desire for dignity is not enough to secure it. Something else is needed as well.
Second, Solidarity was a social movement.
This meant that Solidarity – ostensibly a labor union – became a home for people from all social groups and classes in Poland: workers and intellectuals, engineers and artists, doctors and patients.
Some passionately discussed economic reform, others talked about developing culture, while still others planned to reform education and the scientific establishment or assure the defense of the environment.
Solidarity created a public space for all of these discussions, while protecting us all against the party apparatus.
But Solidarity was still something more.
It was a Polish version of the ancient Greek agora, a meeting place of all citizens, a locus of a free conversation about our communal and individual future, about all kinds of problems and their solutions.
We did not yet have a free state, but we already had something more important than that: a free civil society engaged in discussing the common condition of its members.
The society embraced by Solidarity counted 10 million members; indeed, 10 million real citizens.
But even that was not enough to achieve the final victory over the party and police apparatus of the state.
Third, Solidarity was an institution; indeed, a unique one given the conditions under which we lived, and it is to its special institutional form that we owe our ultimate victory.
Between the organizational structure of Solidarity and the official state and party organizations there was what might be called a “gap between civilizations.”
Against the authoritarian and hierarchical structures of the regime, we raised a decentralized institution, a huge organism striving to achieve consensus about its aims and the methods of action.
It was an institution committed to respecting the integrity of all individuals and all other institutions.
This may not be extraordinary in old democratic communities; but in our authoritarian environment, it was strikingly new.
And only such a new institutional structure could respond to that deep cry for dignity.
So what is left of all this today?
To be sure, Solidarity achieved a stunning political success.
Poland is a free country, a member of NATO and of the EU, while the Soviet Union is no more.
But recent history has not been kind to the victors.
The leaders of the democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe quickly faded in the new environment.
Democratic elections brought out new and savvier politicians, often from among those who were part of the old regime.
More strikingly, some of our hopes for a new social order also crashed against the rocks of the new rules of the game.
True, Poland’s democratic institutions, despite their flaws, function rather well.
Economic growth has been impressive, and life is definitely getting better.
But the vibrancy of civil society, the sense of common purpose, the universal manifestations of social solidarity that our union stood for in its time – all these things are largely gone.
The union itself is a shell of its own former self, a partisan and mostly right-wing movement of workers buffeted by the new economic reality.
Most notably, the unifying character of Solidarity gave way to social divisions and, among many of Poland’s people, a large dose of alienation from both politics and civic engagements.
Is this what normalcy always means?
Do heady times of struggle always give way to a somewhat deflating taste of victory?
Am I merely a veteran wistfully reminiscing about the old days of struggle?
Perhaps.
But I am not a nostalgic type.
I know that we have come a long way, and I do not want to go back.
But was it really inevitable that so much solidarity had to escape our Solidarity?
Global Capital Heads for the Frontier
PRINCETON – So-called “frontier market economies" are the latest fad in investment circles.
Though these low-income countries – including Bangladesh and Vietnam in Asia, Honduras and Bolivia in Latin America, and Kenya and Ghana in Africa – have small, undeveloped financial markets, they are growing rapidly and are expected to become the emerging economies of the future.
In the last four years, inflows of private capital into frontier economies have been nearly 50% higher (relative to GDP) than flows into emerging market economies.
Whether that should be cheered or lamented is a question that has become a kind of Rorschach test for economic analysts and policymakers.
We now know that the promise of free capital mobility has not been redeemed.
By and large, the surge in capital inflows has boosted consumption rather than investment in recipient countries, exacerbating economic volatility and making painful financial crises more frequent.
Rather than exerting discipline, global financial markets have increased the availability of debt, thereby weakening profligate governments' budget constraints and over-extended banks' balance sheets.
The best argument for free capital mobility remains the one made nearly two decades ago by Stanley Fischer, then the International Monetary Fund's number two official and now Vice Chair of the US Federal Reserve.
Though Fischer recognized the perils of free-flowing capital, he argued that the solution was not to maintain capital controls, but to undertake the reforms required to mitigate the dangers.
Fischer made this argument at a time when the IMF was actively seeking to enshrine capital-account liberalization in its charter.
But then the world witnessed financial crises in Asia, Brazil, Argentina, Russia, Turkey, and eventually Europe and America.
To its credit, the Fund has since softened its line on capital controls.
In 2010, it issued a note that recognized capital controls as part of the arsenal of policy tools used to combat financial instability.
Nonetheless, at the IMF and in advanced countries, the prevailing view remains that capital controls are a last resort – to be used only after conventional macroeconomic and financial policies have been exhausted.
Free capital mobility continues to be the ultimate goal, even if some countries may have to take their time getting there.
There are two problems with this view.
First, as advocates of capital mobility tirelessly point out, countries must fulfill a long list of prerequisites before they can benefit from financial globalization.
These include the protection of property rights, effective contract enforcement, eradication of corruption, enhanced transparency and financial information, sound corporate governance, monetary and fiscal stability, debt sustainability, market-determined exchange rates, high-quality financial regulation, and prudential supervision.
In other words, a policy aimed at enabling growth in developing countries requires first-world institutions before it can work.
Worse, the list is not only long; it is also open ended.
As the advanced countries' experience with the global financial crisis has demonstrated, even the most sophisticated regulatory and supervisory systems are far from being failsafe.
Thus, demanding that developing countries build the kind of institutions that will render capital flows safe not only puts the cart before the horse; it is also a fool's errand.
Caution dictates a more pragmatic approach, one that recognizes a permanent role for capital controls alongside other regulatory and prudential tools.
The second problem concerns the possibility that capital inflows may be harmful to growth, even if we leave aside concerns about financial fragility.
Advocates of capital mobility assume that poor economies have lots of profitable investment opportunities that are not being exploited because of a shortage of investible funds.
Let capital come in, they argue, and investment and growth will take off.
But many developing countries are constrained by a lack of investment demand, not a shortage of domestic saving.
The social return on investment may be high, but private returns are low, owing to externalities, high taxes, poor institutions, or any of a wide array of other factors.
Capital inflows in economies that suffer from low investment demand fuel consumption, not capital accumulation.
They also fuel exchange-rate appreciation, which aggravates the investment shortage.
The profitability of tradable industries – those most likely to suffer from appropriability problems – takes a hit, and investment demand falls further.
In these economies, capital inflows may well retard growth rather than stimulate it.
Such concerns have led emerging economies to experiment with a variety of capital controls.
In principle, frontier market economies can learn much from this experience.
As the Johns Hopkins University economist Olivier Jeanne pointed out at a recent IMF conference organized to spur such learning, the capital-flow measures that have become fashionable of late do not work very well.
That is not because they fail to affect the quantity or composition of flows, but because such effects are quite small.
As Brazil, Colombia, South Korea, and others have learned, limited controls that target specific markets such as bonds or short-term bank lending do not have a significant impact on key outcomes – the exchange rate, monetary independence, or domestic financial stability.
The implication is that capital controls may need to be blunt and comprehensive, rather than surgical and targeted, to be truly effective.
Capital controls by themselves are no panacea, and they often create worse problems, such as corruption or a delay in needed reforms, than they solve.
But this is no different from any other area of government action.
We live in a second-best world where policy action is almost always partial (and partially effective), and well-intentioned reforms in one area may backfire in the presence of distortions elsewhere in the system.
In such a world, treating capital controls as the last resort, always and everywhere, has little rationale; indeed, it merely fetishizes financial globalization.
The world needs case-by-case, hardheaded pragmatism, recognizing that capital controls sometimes deserve a prominent place.
Fukushima and Derivatives Meltdowns
CAMBRIDGE – Financial commentators have likened Japan’s earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear catastrophe to derivatives’ role in the 2008 financial meltdown. The resemblance is clear enough: each activity yields big benefits and carries a tiny but explosive risk.
But the similarity between the two types of crisis ends where preventing their recurrence begins.
For the Fukushima nuclear-power plant, a 1,000-year flood and ordinarily innocuous design defects combined to deprive the reactors of circulating water coolant and cause serious radiation leaks.
In financial markets, an unexpected collapse in real-estate securities and design defects in the derivatives and repo markets combined to damage core financial institutions’ ability make good on their payment obligations.
While the basic risks originated outside the systems – a tsunami for Fukushima, over-investment in real-estate mortgages for financial institutions – design defects and bad luck meant that the system couldn’t contain the damage.
In the United States, AIG, Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers – all with large derivatives and/or repo investments – failed, freezing up credit markets for a scary few weeks.
We now understand the Fukushima risks and design defects well.
Not so for the derivatives risks that jeopardized the global economy.
For Fukushima, crews are valiantly trying to stop the radiation leakage.
But for derivatives, the analogous efforts are misdirected and won’t save us from the financial fire next time.
We are rebuilding derivatives and related financial structures atop the same, still-active faults.
Financial players use derivatives to transfer risk: one player assumes the risk of, say, euro fluctuation, but doesn’t want yen risk, while for another, it’s the opposite.
So the former promises to deliver euros next June 1, while the latter promises to deliver yen.
If one currency declines relative to the other, the loser pays the difference.
Repos are financing transactions.
Financial firms sell assets, like Treasury bonds or real-estate securities, for cash, and promise to buy those assets back (i.e., to repurchase them or, for short, to do a “repo”), typically the following day.
But, with the cash coming from short-term repos making up much of core financial firms’ balance sheets, tremors in financial markets could hit them hard, drying up repo financing for a few, as occurred in 2008. Some, like Bear Stearns, then failed.
Individual derivatives and repo transactions are hardly nefarious.
Each alone legitimately transfers risk to those better able to bear it, or backs financial holdings.
But, when over-used by systemically vital firms, they can blow up the financial system, owing to its design defects.
Even today, about 70% of the core US financial firms’ liabilities are very short-term loans, like overnight repos.
In the US, the main design defects are in bankruptcy law, which exempts derivatives and repos from most regular bankruptcy constraints.
For example, investors holding derivatives and repo contracts with a weakened financial institution can grab the firm’s assets ahead of – and at the expense of – its regular creditors, possibly sealing its fate, when, with a little extra time, the firm might have survived.
Such runs were the ruin of AIG, Bear Stearns, and others during the financial crisis.
Worse still, because derivatives and repo investors jump to the head of the repayment line in so many ways, they have less incentive to foster market discipline by closely monitoring their counterparties’ solvency and carefully rationing their exposure to any single counterparty.
They typically get repaid, regardless.
True, someone has to come first.
Other financial players take on more risk because derivatives and repo players’ bankruptcy exemptions put them first.
Usually, we would expect the others to have an interest in more market discipline.
But the next player in line is too often the US government, as guarantor of too-big-to-fail financial institutions, and it is poorly positioned to regulate these markets on a day-to-day basis.
It is not financially nimble; it is often captured by the regulated; and when economic times are good, no official wants to spoil the party.
The US Congress had a chance to fix this design defect in the major financial overhaul that it enacted last summer via the Dodd-Frank bill. But it didn’t.
If investors in derivatives, repos, and credit-default swaps lacked favored treatment, they would behave differently.
Above all, they would insist more often that their counterparties be well capitalized.
They accepted the risk implied by ultra-thin capitalizations when it was mainly US government money on the line; they would be more reluctant to do so if it was mostly their own money that they were wagering.
The public perceives Fukushima-type risks and derivatives risks differently.
Many fear nuclear risks, which are vivid, slowing the industry’s development amid safety concerns.
But the derivatives and repo markets present risks that are poorly understood, difficult to communicate in the media, and hard for politicians to debate and resolve.
During a crisis, these markets attract public attention and scorn, but, as the economy steadies, ordinary people lose interest, leaving the financial industry to control its own destiny with legislatures.
For Fukushima-type risks, analysts are already discussing how nuclear plants can be designed and built to contain earthquake and tsunami risks via passive cooling.
It is possible, the thinking now runs, to design and build nuclear plants that can keep the fuel rods cool even if all power is lost.
But little of importance has yet been done to prevent the damage that derivatives and repo bankruptcy priorities could cause in another financial-system meltdown.
New rules to require end-users (such as oil companies using derivatives to guard against unexpected oil-price changes) and others to put up good collateral are being developed.
But these rules don’t address the main problem: the weakened incentives for market discipline for core financial institutions.
It’s as if we reacted to Fukushima by better handling gas emissions in oil-shale projects.
We should be examining how to make derivatives and repo investors assume the full risk of their decisions when dealing with systemically vital financial institutions.
Instead, we survived the financial tsunami of 2008, only to rebuild in the same place, on the main financial fault-lines, using the same flawed design.
Fukushima, Europe's Nuclear Test
MADRID – Seen from Europe, the irrationality of the political and media discourse over nuclear energy has, if anything, increased and intensified in the year since the meltdown at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi power plant.
Yet a dispassionate assessment of nuclear energy’s place in the world remains as necessary as it is challenging.
Europeans should not pontificate on nuclear-energy policy as if our opinion mattered worldwide, but we do.
On the other hand, Europe does have a qualified responsibility in the area of security, where we still can promote an international regulatory and institutional framework that would discipline states and bring about greater transparency where global risks like nuclear power are concerned.
Europe is equally responsible for advancing research on more secure technologies, particularly a fourth generation of nuclear-reactor technology.
We Europeans cannot afford the luxury of dismantling a high-value-added industrial sector in which we still have a real comparative advantage.
In Europe, Fukushima prompted a media blitz of gloom and doom over nuclear energy.
The German magazine Der Spiegel heralded the “9/11 of the nuclear industry” and “the end of the nuclear era,” while Spain’s leading newspaper El Pais preached that supporting “this energy [was] irrational,” and that “China has put a brake on its nuclear ambitions.”
But reality has proven such assessments to be both biased and hopelessly wrong.
True, a few countries – Belgium, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland, with Peru the only non- European country to join the trend – formally declared their intention to phase out or avoid nuclear energy.
These decisions affect a total of 26 reactors, while 61 reactors are under construction around the world, with another 156 projected and 343 under official consideration.
If these plans are realized, the number of functioning reactors, currently 437, will double.
But, more interestingly, the nuclear boom is not global: Brazil is at the forefront in Latin America, while the fastest development is occurring in Asia, mostly in China and India.
If we compare this geographical distribution with a global snapshot of nuclear sites prior to the Three Mile Island nuclear meltdown in the United States in 1979, a striking correlation emerges between countries’ nuclear-energy policy and their geopolitical standing and economic vigor.
Whereas the appetite for reactors in the 1970’s reflected the international heft of the Soviet Union, and principally that of the geopolitical West – Japan, the US, and Europe – today the center of gravity has shifted irrevocably to the East, where nuclear energy has become a “gateway to a prosperous future,” in the telling words of a November 2011 commentary in The Hindu.
Indeed, US President Barack Obama, evidently agreeing with that view, has boldly bet that loan guarantees and research into creating small modular reactors will reconfirm America’s global position at the forefront of civilian nuclear technology and its relevance in the new global order.
Energy is, of course, the bloodline of any society, reflected in the correlation between energy demand and income.
In this respect, nuclear energy’s advantages, particularly its reliability and predictable costs, stand out.
The International Energy Agency’s 2010 World Energy Outlook foresees a rise in global energy demand of 40% by 2030 – an unforgiving reality that is most tangibly felt in developing countries, particularly in Asia.
So expansion of nuclear energy is, and will continue to be, a fact.
To act responsibly, Europeans should be working to enhance international security standards for nuclear power, not opting out of the game.
The real lesson of Fukushima is that state controls are necessary but not sufficient to ensure nuclear safety.
Unfortunately, a proposal last year at the International Atomic Energy Agency aimed at launching an effective international control system on safety and security of nuclear power worldwide blatantly failed with the acquiescence of the European Union.
Worse still, with European backing, the IAEA’s budget, already a paltry €300 million, has been cut by almost 10%.
In this context, an initiative to mandate random IAEA inspections of 10% of the world’s operating reactors within three years was watered down, again with the EU’s active support, on the grounds that responsibility for security and inspections should rest primarily with member states.
Only a slim provision that made joint inspections with the IAEA voluntary made it into the final agreement.
As for the EU itself, the debate and final formulation of the March 2011 “voluntary” stress tests, accurately called “stormy” by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, revealed a bewildering array of deficiencies and weaknesses.
Perhaps the most striking contradiction in Europe’s nuclear discourse is the discrepancy between the seeming effort to boost economic growth and employment, and the flippancy of member states in abandoning the nuclear industry, which depends on the design, engineering, and command-and-control skills that underlie Europe’s comparative advantage in the industry.
One heartening exception is a recent agreement between the United Kingdom and France to forge a manufacturing alliance between Rolls Royce and Areva in nuclear technology.
But they should not be alone. Is it reasonable that Europe’s countries give up a niche of prosperity on ideological grounds that are irrelevant from a global perspective?
The rise of nuclear power in Europe paralleled its post-war economic prowess.
It coincided with the peak of the West’s belief in its soaring economic strength and perpetual global ascendancy.
Today, with Europe increasingly seen as the sick man of the world’s economy, even the whole continent’s renunciation of nuclear energy would have little to no reverberation on the world stage.
Dictating the direction of the policy discourse is no longer Europe’s role.
Behaving responsibly is.
Africa’s Future Depends on Improving Education
LAGOS – It is time for an entrepreneurial and knowledge revolution in Africa.
Only a properly educated workforce and entrepreneurial class will have the skills and drive to thrive as new technologies change the nature of work, leisure, the environment, and society – and to tackle our continent’s most pressing challenges.
Many people in Africa and beyond share this view.
When French President Emmanuel Macron visited Nigeria in July 2018, he offered a bold prediction: if Africa’s youngest entrepreneurs worked hard and innovated, he said, they would change their countries and transform the world.
Similarly, when Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg visited a Co-Creation Hub in Lagos in 2016, he was impressed by the “energy” of the country’s youthful innovators – the social entrepreneurs, tech companies, and investors who are collaborating to solve some of Nigeria’s toughest challenges.
But that energy can go only so far without education.
Indeed, while Macron and Zuckerberg are right to be inspired by Africa’s youth, the entrepreneurial and knowledge revolution that is needed to ensure a prosperous future for the continent can happen only if there is also an education revolution.
Simply put, we need to get all of Africa’s children in school, so that the next generation of entrepreneurs has the skills it needs to succeed.
Africa faces huge challenges in reforming its education sector.
While access to education has expanded dramatically over the last 25 years, and more boys and girls are in classrooms than ever before, many young people are still not learning what they need to thrive now and in the future.
If current trends continue, by 2050 some one-third of Africa’s one billion young people will lack basic proficiency in math, reading, and other subjects.
Millions will be unemployable and unproductive.
Today’s educational shortcomings weaken Africa’s development capacity.
According to the World Economic Forum, Africa needs another one million university-trained researchers to tackle its most pressing health, energy, and development challenges.
But educating those scientists and potential entrepreneurs is an uphill battle.
Technology has transformed the modern workplace, but curricula, modes of learning and instruction, and teacher quality all continue to lag.
Even good schools exhibit a gap between the skills students need – like critical thinking and problem solving – and what they are being taught.
Unless such shortcomings are addressed, Africa’s future workforce will be unable to lead the type of change many are expecting.
To be sure, Africa is not facing this challenge alone.
According to a 2016 report by the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity (the Education Commission), where I serve as a commissioner, by 2030, more than 800 million children – half the world’s school-age population – will graduate or drop out of school without the skills to secure a decent job.
This is a global learning crisis, and it demands a global solution.
One of the biggest obstacles to improving education quality is financing.
Today, only 10% of official development assistance funds education programs in poor countries.
Clearly, that share needs to increase.
But even an increase in international funding levels would not be enough to ensure that every child in every school was learning.
To accomplish that, we need new approaches to supporting education and new mechanisms to solicit and deliver financing.
For several years, I have joined colleagues from around the world in government, civil society, and the private sector to help the Education Commission study funding solutions.
Our big, innovative idea is to create an International Finance Facility for Education (IFFEd), which pools donor funds to make it easier to secure loans from multilateral institutions like the World Bank and the African Development Bank.
It also seeks to help lower-middle-income countries access credit at favorable rates and avoid the debt trap of high-interest loans.
Ultimately, by leveraging $2 billion in donor guarantees, the IFFEd will make $10 billion in grants and concessional funding available to the some of the world’s most challenged countries.
But change needs to start at home.
The facility will succeed only if African countries increase their domestic spending on education.
On average, the poorest countries spend just 3% of their national budgets on schooling, while middle-income countries spend an average of 4%.
Our data indicate that those figures will need to increase to 5-6% to make a lasting difference.
While investments in physical infrastructure like roads and railways are critical, investments in young minds are equally important.
It costs about $400 a year to educate a school-age child in Africa.
That is a fortune for a poor family struggling to make ends meet.
But for governments in Africa and around the world, it is a small price to pay to train the creators of future prosperity.
After all, as Nelson Mandela famously said, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”
Private Wealth and European Solidarity
COLOGNE – A little-discussed but crucial factor in the debate over wealth transfers from Europe’s more economically sound north to its troubled south is the relationship between public debt, GDP, and private wealth (households’ financial and non-financial assets, minus their financial liabilities) – in particular, the ratio of private wealth to GDP in the eurozone countries.
While the European Central Bank’s bond-purchasing scheme has calmed financial markets to a considerable extent, some European economies – including Italy, Spain, Greece, and Portugal – are still at risk, because they are not growing fast enough to narrow their deficits and stem the growth of their national debts.
The grim irony here is that the ratio of private wealth to GDP in some of the countries that are in need of support from the ECB and northern eurozone members is equal to or higher than that in more solvent countries.
Consider Italy, which has the highest ratio of private wealth to public debt of any G-7 country, and is some 30% to 40% higher than in Germany.
Likewise, Italy and France share a private wealth/GDP ratio of five to one, while Spain’s – at least before the crisis hit the country in full – was six to one.
By contrast, the ratio in Germany, Europe’s largest creditor, is only 3.5 to one.
This discrepancy is at the heart of the question with which European policymakers are now grappling: Should taxpayers in debtor countries expect “solidarity” – or, more bluntly, money – from taxpayers in creditor countries?
Why should taxpayers in creditor countries have to take responsibility for financing the euro crisis, especially given that high private wealth/GDP ratios may result from low tax revenues over time, while lower ratios may reflect higher tax revenues?
Before seeking or accepting help from the rest of Europe, countries should employ all available domestic resources.
Debtor governments should call upon their own taxpayers to fund some of the national debt in order to avoid higher interest rates in credit markets.
They could, for example, offer an incentive in the form of a 3-4% interest rate on bonds, and even make them tax-free eventually.
This would allow Italy, Spain, and even Greece to finance their national debts at a more reasonable, sustainable cost.
Citizens’ voluntary financing of their countries’ national debt would be the most effective means of reducing strain on Europe’s financial resources, while simultaneously serving as a powerful symbol of solidarity.
By contrast, turning creditor-country citizens’ tax payments into forced subsidies of other countries’ debts would undermine European cohesion.
Nordic countries, for example, cannot be expected to fund other countries’ debts in the long term – especially if those countries have not made full use of their own resources.
In fact, while concerns over the eurozone’s survival tend to focus on its indebted members, Europe’s monetary union is at risk of losing one of the few members that still enjoys a triple-A credit rating: Finland.
Given Finland’s difficult domestic political situation, its citizens may look to Denmark and Sweden – which boast rapid growth and low national debt, and do not pay into the European Financial Stability Facility or the European Stability Mechanism – and decide that eurozone membership costs too much and is no longer worthwhile.
Italy and Spain have enough resources to rescue themselves, and to secure the time needed to restructure their economies.
Indeed, even after taking on the entire national debt, their private wealth/GDP ratios would still be higher than they are in some northern European countries.
Escaping the euro crisis is less a matter of economics than of political will.
By calling upon citizens to finance their own countries’ national debts, southern Europe’s leaders can fix their own economies and strengthen the European principles of solidarity and subsidiarity.
Furnace Cities
COPENHAGEN -- It’s possible to see, right now, what global warming will eventually do to the planet.
To peek into the future, all we have to do is go to Beijing, Athens, Tokyo, or, in fact, just about any city on Earth.
Most of the world’s urban areas have already experienced far more dramatic temperature hikes over the past few decades than the 2.6°C increase expected from global warming over the next hundred years.
It’s simple enough to understand.
On a hot day in New York, locals sprawl out on the grass fields of Central Park, not on asphalt parking lots or concrete sidewalks.
Bricks, concrete, and asphalt – the building blocks from which cities are made – absorb much more heat from the sun than vegetation does in the countryside.
Across an entire city, there’s much more tarmac than there is grass.
So the air above the city heats up.
This effect, called an “urban heat island,” was discovered in London in the early 1800’s.
Today, the fastest-growing cities are in Asia.
Beijing is roughly 10°C hotter than the nearby countryside in the daytime and 5.5°C warmer at night.
There are even more dramatic increases in Tokyo.
In August, temperatures there climbed 12.5oC above the surrounding countryside, reaching 40oC – a scorching heat that affected not only the downtown area, but also covered some 8,000 square kilometers.
Looking at a fast-growing city like Houston, Texas, we can see the real effect of the urban heat island.
Over the last 12 years, Houston grew by 20%, or 300,000 inhabitants.
During that time, the night time temperature increased about 0.8°C. Over a hundred-year period, that would translate to a whopping 7°C increase.
But, while celebrity activists warn about the impending doom posed by climate change, a more realistic view is offered by these cities’ ability to cope.
Despite dramatic increases over the past 50 or 100 years, these cities have not come tumbling down.
Even as temperatures have risen, heat-related deaths have decreased, owing to improved health care, access to medical facilities, and air-conditioning.
We have far more money and much greater technological ability to adapt than our forebears ever did.
Of course, cities also will be hit by temperature increases from CO2, in addition to further warming from urban heat islands.
But we have an opportunity to act.
Unlike our forebears, who did very little or nothing about urban heat islands, we are in a good position to tackle many of their effects.
While celebrity activists focus entirely on cutting CO2, we could do much more – and at much lower cost – if we addressed urban heat islands.
Simple solutions can make a vast difference to temperatures.
Cities are hotter than the land around them because they are drier.
They lack moist green spaces and have drainage systems that efficiently remove water.
In London, the air around the River Thames is cooler than it is a few blocks away in built-up areas.
If we plant trees and build water features, we won’t just beautify our surroundings, but we’ll also cool things down – by upwards of 8°C, according to climate models.
Moreover, although it may seem almost comically straightforward, one of the best temperature-reducing approaches is very simple: paint things white.
Cities have a lot of black asphalt and dark, heat-absorbing structures.
By increasing reflection and shade, a great deal of heat build-up can be avoided.
Paint most of a city and you could lower the temperature by 10°C.
These options are simple, obvious, and cost-effective.
Consider Los Angeles.
Re-roofing most of the city’s five million homes in lighter colors, painting a quarter of the roads and planting 11 million trees would have a one-time cost of about $1 billion.
Each year after that, this would lower air conditioning costs by about $170 million and provide $360 million in smog-reduction benefits.
And it would lower LA temperatures by about 3°C – or about the temperature increase envisioned for the rest of this century.
Compare that to the $180 billion cost of implementing the Kyoto Protocol, which will have virtually no effect.
At the moment, we don’t hear much about the smartest choices when it comes to addressing global warming.
That needs to change.
We do get to choose which future we want.
The Negative Rates Club
BRUSSELS – For the better part of a decade, central banks have been making only limited headway in curbing powerful global deflationary forces.
Since 2008, the US Federal Reserve has maintained zero interest rates, while pursuing multiple waves of unprecedented balance-sheet expansion through large-scale bond purchases.
The Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank have followed suit, each with its own version of so-called “quantitative easing” (QE).
Yet inflation has not picked up appreciably anywhere.
Despite their shared struggles with deflationary pressures, these countries’ monetary policies – and economic performance – are now diverging.
Whereas the United States and the United Kingdom are now growing strongly enough to exit their expansionary policies and raise interest rates, the eurozone and Japan are doubling down on QE, pushing policy long-term interest rates further into negative territory.
What explains this difference?
The short answer is debt.
The US and the UK have been running current-account deficits for decades, and are thus debtors, while the eurozone and Japan have been running external surpluses, making them creditors.
Because negative rates benefit debtors and harm creditors, introducing them after the global economic crisis spurred a recovery in the US and the UK, but had little effect in the eurozone and Japan.
This is not an isolated phenomenon.
By now, most of the world’s creditor countries – those with large and persistent current-account surpluses, such as Denmark and Switzerland – have negative interest rates, not only for long-term governments bonds and other “riskless” debt, but also for medium-term maturities.
And it is doing little good.
Despite the weak impact of low interest rates, central banks in these economies remain committed to them.
If it is suggested that QE or lower interest rates are unlikely to benefit their economies much, they shift the focus of the discussion, railing against the notion that raising interest rates would stimulate the economy – an ostensibly airtight argument.
Only it is actually far from airtight.
Basic economics courses cover the curious case of the “backward-bending supply curve of savings”: In some circumstances, lower interest rates can lead to higher savings.
Because lower rates reduce savers’ income, they spend less, especially if they have a savings target for their retirement.
None of this discredits the general rule – which forms the basis of modern monetary policymaking – that a lower interest rate tends to stimulate consumption and other expenditure.
The impact simply varies according to the economy’s debt position.
In a closed economy, there is a debtor for every creditor, so whatever creditors lose from ultra-low interest rates, debtors should gain.
But in an economy with a large net-foreign-asset position, there are naturally more creditors than debtors.
For a country with large foreign debts, the opposite is true.
The effectiveness of monetary policy at the lower bound should thus be different in creditor and debtor economies.
Until recently, this condition did not matter, because foreign-asset positions were usually small (as a percentage of GDP).
Today, however, these positions in the major industrial economies are large and increasingly divergent, partly owing to the buildup of leverage that led to the global financial crisis of 2007-2008.
And, in fact, at the international level, leverage is continuing to grow.
Though current-account imbalances have generally fallen since the financial crisis began, they have not reversed.
This implies that the surplus countries continue to strengthen their creditor positions, diverging from the deficit economies.
Commodity exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, which ran large current-account surpluses when oil prices were high, are the main exception to this pattern of diverging foreign-asset positions.
With the precipitous decline in world oil prices since June 2014, their fortunes have reversed.
Their export earnings have plummeted – falling by half in many cases – forcing them to run deficits and draw on the large sovereign-wealth funds they accumulated during the global commodity boom.
A radical reduction in expenditure has now become unavoidable.
The industrialized economies face very different challenges.
Their problem – in a sense, a luxury problem – is to ensure that their consumers spend the windfall from lower import prices.
But in the creditor countries, negative rates do not seem to advance this goal; indeed, some external surpluses are even increasing.
This divergence is also playing out within the eurozone.
Though it is a creditor economy overall, it comprises debtor countries as well.
The debtor economies, such as Spain and Portugal, now run small current-account surpluses, and are gradually reducing their debt.
But the traditional creditors have seen their current-account surpluses grow so much that the debtor/creditor asymmetry continues to increase.
Most notably, since the start of the financial crisis, Germany's current-account surplus has increased to nearly 8% of GDP, meaning that the country has accumulated more surpluses in that period than in its entire previous history.
On current trends, the German creditor position might rise from 60% of GDP to 100% of GDP.
Central bankers are supposed to be patient.
Indeed, economists supported the global movement toward central-bank independence precisely because it seemed that central bankers would be less inclined to try to stimulate the economy for short-term gain.
But central bankers seem to have become impatient, fretting about low inflation, even though the output gap is slowly closing and full employment has been reached in the US and Japan.
Creditor countries’ central bankers must stop trying to manipulate their economies with more potentially counterproductive monetary easing.
Instead, they should allow the recovery to run its course, even if that happens slowly, and wait for the base effect of lower oil prices to disappear.
ECB President Mario Draghi recently admitted that, in today’s global context, the current monetary-policy approach might not be effective.
But promising more of the same is not the answer.
The Future of Economic Convergence
WASHINGTON, DC – Who can now sustain rapid economic growth?
The answer to this question will determine not just the geography of prosperity in the coming decades, but also what the balance of global economic activity will look like in 2030 or 2050.
Increasingly, it appears plausible that this balance will partly shift away from the United States and its post-World War II allies and toward the new potential economic superpowers, China and India.
But that shift will not necessarily change the way the world works.
On paper, economic growth – a sustained increase in productivity– may seem simple.
An economy’s productivity, or output per capita, is a function of capital stock, labor (the number of workers and how educated they are), and an admittedly vague residual known as “total factor productivity,” which refers to how capital and labor are organized.
The basic idea behind modern economic growth – which started in the late eighteenth century – is that it involves constructing physical capital (buildings, machines, and infrastructure), increasing education levels, and combining these “factors of production” in a way that raises productivity.
Technological innovation, either homegrown or imported, typically helps.
There are no profound secrets here.
Countries have been growing in this manner for more than 200 years.
You can tailor a growth strategy based on your natural resources, such as abundant coal or access to the sea.
You can grow by relying on a stronger role for the government (as in Singapore) or by relying mostly on the private sector (as in Hong Kong).
Why, then, have so many countries found it hard to grow in a sustained manner?
For at least 50 years after World War II’s end, there was remarkably little convergence in per capita income.
Rich economies (Western Europe, the US, Canada, and Australia) moved steadily ahead, while most poorer countries, despite some episodes of decent growth, did not move significantly closer to the leaders’ productivity and income levels.
The relatively few major positive growth surprises in the past 50 years have almost all been in Asian countries that focused initially on exporting cheap manufactured goods and then found ways to improve quality and offer more sophisticated products.
Japan may be considered the first non-European country to have used this development path; Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and others have followed.
China’s development is often considered to follow broadly similar lines, as documented in a recent McKinsey Global Institute report.
The most straightforward explanation is that elites in those countries figured out that they would do well from exports and associated economic growth.
Consequently, they sorted out the politics, kept corruption under control, and arranged for government to be run in a reasonable manner.
Looking at the recent data on economic performance across the world, Arvind Subramanian, former chief economic adviser to the Indian government, and his colleagues argue that convergence in per capita income is taking hold more broadly.
This is entirely plausible, and may signify – in my interpretation – that more elites now favor growth.
The demonstration effect of China may be compelling, with the lesson being that it is possible to implement the reforms needed to grow fast while staying in power.
This may sound cynical but it is actually an optimistic message, at least in terms of the outlook for reducing poverty around the world.
As a result, there is good reason to think that China and India may be able to sustain annual growth rates of around 7%, while developed countries such as the US tend to average 2-3% growth.
Extrapolating from these growth rates suggests that emerging markets could account for well over 50% of world GDP measured at market exchange rates by 2030.
Surely there will be bumps in road, but steady progress seems likely.
The impact on the global system, with its existing structure of multilateral institutions (such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization) and myriad standard-setting and consensus-building organizations, may be smaller than one thinks.
It is hard to create new rules and norms.
As the existing system allows for growth, why not just work within it?
For the US, as long as the dollar remains the world’s main reserve currency and safe haven of choice, the impact of falling to second or perhaps even third place in terms of economic output may not be so great.
In fact, the US could do well as a source of innovation and new products, selling to a larger global market.
The main factors undermining the prospects for US prosperity are mostly the result of its own political decisions.
Unsustainable fiscal deficits, questionable trade policy, a high level of inequality, crumbling infrastructure, underperforming schools, and unaffordable health care are the result of domestic choices.
Whether or not Americans come to grips with those issues has little to do with China or India.
The Future of Tech Policy
STANFORD – Technology and the largest tech firms are becoming increasingly controversial.
Today, there are growing concerns about third parties accessing and manipulating Facebook user data; and before that, there was a raging debate about whether the government should be able to unlock devices belonging to suspects of terrorism or other crimes.
More broadly, technology-driven job dislocation has become a source of constant anxiety.
For all of these reasons, technology policy has taken center stage, as I predicted it would exactly one year ago.
Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently conceded in congressional testimony that some regulation of his industry is necessary, and there is now an open window of opportunity to pursue new policies for the sector.
In formulating such policies – whether through legislation, regulatory rule-setting, international agreements, or measures addressing related issues such as tax and trade – the goal should be to limit the downsides of technology without stifling innovation.
To that end, five interrelated issues should be kept in mind.
The first is privacy.
Although the European Union’s far-reaching General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) goes into force on May 25, it will not offer any protection for non-Europeans.
In the case of Facebook, that translates into 1.5 billion users, almost all of whom have clicked to agree to the company’s terms of service without having read them.
There are currently proposals to require tech companies to obtain an affirmative opt-in from users before collecting their data, and to allow users to retrieve or erase their data easily.
How customers and companies, including new entrants, would react to such rules remains to be seen.
To collect more data, firms might offer users inducements beyond the putatively free services they already provide, and that may or may not slow down the pace at which they can enhance services or add newfeatures.
The second issue is market power.
In the early years of the Internet, an infant tech industry pled for a hands-off approach to regulation and taxation.
But now, the four largest US firms by market capitalization – Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon – are all tech companies (as of this writing, Berkshire Hathaway had edged out Facebook for fifth place).
Devising sensible policies on this front will require that we first define the market, and then decide what level of concentration, and over what time frame, constitutes a threat to competition.
The tech sector seems to follow a classic pattern of Schumpeterian creative destruction, whereby successive waves of monopoly ascension give way to displacement: cell phones replaced landlines; email displaced postal mail; and social media and texting are supplanting phone calls.
Currently, Apple and Google hold a duopoly on smartphone operating systems, yet they compete vigorously to improve their features and roll out new products.
Meanwhile, the iOS and Android app stores have become both a point of entry for many small businesses and a barrier to entry for new smartphone providers.
Likewise, Facebook and Google dominate the digital advertising market, but their profits allow them to offer ostensibly free email and social-media services that benefit consumers.
Elsewhere, the US government is trying to block a merger between the telecom giants AT&T and Time Warner, which owns a movie studio, cable television stations, and print publications.
Whereas regulators worry that the merger would lead to higher prices, AT&T argues that it is facing direct competition from tech giants like Netflix and Amazon, which both offer online video streaming and original programming. (Amazon is also dominant in online retail and data-center infrastructure.)
The question, then, is whether the current competition among the behemoths more than offsets their market power.
A third issue concerns the control of information.
Owing to the convenience and addictiveness of smartphones and social media, many people now get news exclusively from online platforms like Facebook.
And yet the microtargeted advertising model used by Google and Facebook has disrupted print journalism’s traditional source of revenue, along with coverage of state and local governments.
Even worse, social-media algorithms tend to amplify the most extreme material at the expense of more credible sources.
But efforts to eliminate material viewed as extreme by some will raise the specter of censorship.
Conservatives, especially, fear that left-leaning companies in Silicon Valley will be allowed to decide what counts as acceptable debate.
The fourth issue is the concentration of wealth.
The founders of today’s tech giants are now among the world’s wealthiest people, with Amazon’s Jeff Bezos topping the list.
But their growing fortunes stand in stark contrast to decades of slow wage growth, which is creating a political backlash.
Still, the creative destruction of the digital era has also enriched many tech workers and investors, while reducing the fortunes of previous incumbents.
It has both destroyed and created well-paying jobs.
And, most important, it has produced goods and services that make virtually all of us better off.
Policies to address distributional concerns should not suppress entrepreneurship or discourage work, saving, and investment, especially for new market entrants.
For example, a capital-gains tax, whatever its distributional intent, amounts to a tax on becoming rich.
And yet creating incentives for people to improve their lot is what drives broad-based prosperity.
The last issue concerns national security and national economic interests.
This month, a number of tech firms, including Microsoft and Facebook, declared that they will not assist any government in conducting offensive cyberwarfare operations, and that they will defend unconditionally any countries or individuals targeted by a cyber attack.
Does that really include a cyber attack against North Korea or Iran to preempt a nuclear event?
With respect to economic interests, all governments look for ways to help their countries’ own industries, whether through regulation, subsidies, or trade barriers.
But China has been playing a different game with its alleged theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfers.
With China expanding its cyberwarfare capabilities and investing in vital telecom infrastructure, the US government recently saw fit to bar US firms from selling components to the Chinese telecom giant ZTE.
In response, China is now holding up the US chipmaker Qualcomm’s acquisition of the Dutch semiconductor firm NXP.
All of these issues will shape the future of tech policy, and thus future innovations and the benefits they bring to society.
Preventing the Next Eurozone Crisis Starts Now
PARIS – European leaders have devoted scant attention to the future of the eurozone since July 2012, when Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank’s president, famously committed to do “whatever it takes” to save the common currency.
For more than four years, they have essentially subcontracted the eurozone’s stability and integrity to the central bankers.
But, while the ECB has performed the job skillfully, this quiet, convenient arrangement is coming to an end, because no central bank can solve political or constitutional conundrums.
Europe’s heads of state and government would be wise to start over and consider options for the eurozone’s future, rather than letting circumstances decide for them.
So far, Europe’s leaders have had little appetite for such a discussion.
In June 2015, they only paid lip service to a report on the euro’s future by the presidents of the various European institutions.
A few weeks later, the issue briefly returned to the agenda when eurozone leaders spent a long late-July night arguing about whether to kick out Greece; but their stated intention to follow up and address underlying problems was short-lived.
Finally, plans to respond to the Brexit shock by strengthening the eurozone were quickly ditched, owing to fear that reform would prove too divisive.
The issue, however, has not gone away.
Although the monetary anesthetics administered by the ECB have reduced market tensions, nervousness has reemerged in the run-up to the Italian constitutional referendum on December 4.
By end-November spreads between Italian and German ten-year bunds reached 200 basis points, a level not seen since 2014.
The worrying state of several Italian banks is one reason for the mounting concern.
Brexit, and the election of a US president who advocates Americanism instead of globalism and dismisses the EU, adds the risk that voters, rather than markets, will call into question European monetary integration.
Anti-euro political parties are on the rise in all major eurozone countries except Spain.
In Italy, they may well command a majority.
On the economic front, the eurozone has much unfinished business.
The banking union, launched in June 2012 to sever the interdependence of banks and states, has made good progress but is not yet complete.
Competitiveness gaps between eurozone members have diminished, and external imbalances within it have abated, but largely thanks to the compression of domestic demand in Southern Europe; saving flows from North to South have not resumed.
Unemployment gaps remain wide.
The eurozone still lacks a common fiscal mechanism as well, and Germany has flatly rejected the European Commission’s recent attempt to promote a “positive stance” in countries with room to boost spending.
Of course, when the next recession hits, fiscal stability is likely to be in dangerously short supply.
Finally, the governance of the eurozone remains excessively cumbersome and technocratic.
Most ministers, not to mention legislators, appear to have become lost in a procedural morass.
This unsatisfactory equilibrium may or may not last, depending on political or financial risks – or, most likely, the interaction between them.
So the question now is how to hold a fruitful discussion to map out possible responses.
The obstacles are twofold: First, there is no longer any momentum toward “more Europe”; on the contrary, a combination of skepticism about Europe and reluctance concerning potential transfers constitutes a major stumbling block.
And, second, views about the nature and root causes of the euro crisis differ across countries.
Given the dearth of political capital to spend on European responses, and disagreement on what the problem is and how to solve it, governments’ excess of caution is hardly surprising.
Both obstacles can be overcome.
For starters, discussion of the eurozone’s future should not be framed as necessarily leading to further integration.
The goal should be to make the eurozone work, which may imply giving more powers to the center in some fields, but also less in others.
Fiscal responsibility, for example, should not be reduced to centralized enforcement of a common regime.
It is possible to design a policy framework that embodies a more decentralized approach, empowering national institutions to monitor budgetary behavior and overall fiscal sustainability.
In fact, some steps in this direction have already been taken.
Going further would imply making governments individually responsible for their misconduct – in other words, making partial debt restructuring possible within the eurozone.
Such an approach would raise significant difficulties, if only because transiting to such a regime would be a hazardous journey; but options of this sort should be part of the discussion.
To overcome the second obstacle, the discussion should not start by addressing the legacy problems.
Distributing a burden between creditors and debtors is inevitably acrimonious, because it is a purely zero-sum game.
The history of international financial relations demonstrates that such discussions are inevitably delayed and necessarily adversarial when they take place.
So the issue should not be addressed first.
The seemingly realistic option of starting with immediate problems before addressing longer-term issues is only superficially attractive.
In reality, discussions should start with the features of the permanent regime to be established in the longer run.
Participants should explore logically coherent options until they determine if they can agree on a blueprint.
It is only when agreement on a blueprint for the future has been reached that the path toward realizing it should be discussed.
There are no quick fixes to the eurozone’s problems.
But one thing is clear: the lack of genuine discussion on possible futures is a serious cause for concern.
Silence is not always golden; for the sake of Europe’s future, the hush surrounding the common currency should be broken as soon as possible.
Work in an Automated Future
LONDON – Disruptive technologies are now dictating our future, as new innovations increasingly blur the lines between physical, digital, and biological realms.
Robots are already in our operating rooms and fast-food restaurants; we can now use 3D imaging and stem-cell extraction to grow human bones from a patient’s own cells; and 3D printing is creating a circular economy in which we can use and then reuse raw materials.
This tsunami of technological innovation will continue to change profoundly how we live and work, and how our societies operate.
In what is now called the Fourth Industrial Revolution, technologies that are coming of age – including robotics, nanotechnology, virtual reality, 3D printing, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and advanced biology – will converge.
And as these technologies continue to be developed and widely adopted, they will bring about radical shifts in all disciplines, industries, and economies, and in the way that individuals, companies, and societies produce, distribute, consume, and dispose of goods and services.
These developments have provoked anxious questions about what role humans will play in a technology-driven world.
A 2013 University of Oxford study estimates that close to half of all jobs in the United States could be lost to automation over the next two decades.
On the other hand, economists such as Boston University’s James Bessen argue that automation often goes hand in hand with the creation of new jobs.
So which is it – new jobs or massive structural unemployment?
At this point, we can be certain that the Fourth Industrial Revolution will have a disruptive impact on employment, but no one can yet predict the scale of change.
So, before we swallow all of the bad news, we should look at history, which suggests that technological change more often affects the nature of work, rather than the opportunity to participate in work itself.
The First Industrial Revolution moved British manufacturing from people’s homes into factories, and marked the beginning of hierarchical organization.
This change was often violent, as the famous early-nineteenth-century Luddite riots in England demonstrated.
To find work, people were forced to move from rural areas to industrial centers, and it was during this period that the first labor movements emerged.
The Second Industrial Revolution ushered in electrification, large-scale production, and new transportation and communication networks, and created new professions such as engineering, banking, and teaching.
This is when middle classes emerged and began to demand new social policies and an increased role for government.
During the Third Industrial Revolution, modes of production were further automated by electronics and by information and communication technology, with many human jobs moving from manufacturing into services.
When automated teller machines (ATMs) arrived in the 1970s, it was initially assumed that they would be a disaster for workers in retail banking.
And yet the number of bank branch jobs actually increased over time as costs fell.
The nature of the job had changed: it became less transactional and more focused on customer service.
Disruption accompanied each previous industrial revolution, and the fourth will be no different.
But if we keep in mind the lessons of history, we can manage the change.
For starters, we need to focus on skills, and not just on the specific jobs that will appear or disappear.
If we determine which skill sets we will need, we can educate and train the human workforce to leverage all of the new opportunities that technology creates.
Human-resources departments, educational institutions, and governments should lead the charge on this effort.
Second, past experience has repeatedly shown that disadvantaged classes must be protected; workers who are vulnerable to being displaced by technology must have the time and means to adjust.
As we saw in 2016, there can be far-reaching consequences when vast inequalities of opportunities and outcomes lead people to believe that they have no future.
Last but not least, to ensure that the Fourth Industrial Revolution translates into economic growth and bears fruit for all, we must work together to create new regulatory ecosystems.
Governments will have a crucial role to play, but business and civil-society leaders will also need to collaborate with governments to determine the appropriate regulations and standards for new technologies and industries.
I am under no illusions that this will be easy.
Politics, not technology, will determine the pace of change, and implementing the necessary reforms will be hard, slow work, particularly in democracies.
It will require a mix of forward-looking policymaking, agile regulatory frameworks, and, above all, effective partnerships across organizational and national boundaries.
A good model to keep in mind is Denmark’s “flexicurity” system, in which a flexible labor market is paired with a strong social safety net that includes training and re-skilling services for all citizens.
Technology may be advancing rapidly, but it will not cause time itself to collapse.
The momentous – indeed, revolutionary – changes ahead will take place over many decades, not as a big bang.
Individuals, companies, and societies do have time to adjust; but there is no time for delay.
Creating a future in which all can benefit must start now.
The Not-So-Dire Future of Work
WASHINGTON, DC – The future of work is a hot topic nowadays.
It has inspired a seemingly endless train of analyses, commentaries, and conferences, and it featured prominently in last week’s annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
For good reason: new technologies – namely, digitization, robotics, and artificial intelligence – have far-reaching implications for employment.
But, contrary to how the story is often framed, a happy ending is possible.
The current debate often skews toward the melodramatic, foretelling a future in which machines drive humans out of work.
According to some bleak estimates, 47% of jobs are at risk in the United States; 57% in the OECD countries; two thirds in developing economies; and half of all jobs globally (around two billion).
But similarly dire predictions of large-scale job destruction and high technology-driven structural unemployment accompanied previous major episodes of automation, including by renowned economists.
John Maynard Keynes offered one; Wassily Leontief provided another.
Neither materialized.
Instead, technological change acted as a powerful driver of productivity and employment growth.
One key reason is that the technological innovations that destroy some existing jobs also create new ones.
While new technologies reduce demand for low- to middle-skill workers in routine jobs, such as clerical work and repetitive production, they also raise demand for higher-skill workers in technical, creative, and managerial fields.
A recent analysis estimates that new tasks and job titles explain about half of the recent employment growth in the US.
Given this, the evolution of work should be viewed as a process of dynamic adjustment, not as a fundamentally destructive process that we should seek to slow.
To erect barriers to innovation, such as taxes on robots, which some have proposed as a way to ease the pressure on workers, would be counterproductive.
Instead, measures should focus on equipping workers with the higher-level skills that a changing labor market demands, and supporting workers during the adjustment process.
So far, education and training have been losing the race with technology.
Shortages of the technical and higher-level skills demanded by new technologies are partly responsible for the paradox of booming technology and slowing productivity growth in advanced economies: skills shortages have constrained the diffusion of innovations.
Imbalances between supply and demand have also fueled income inequality, by increasing the wage premia that those with the right skills can command.
To address these shortcomings, education and training programs must be revamped and expanded.
As the old career path of “learn, work, retire” gives way to one of continuous learning – a process reinforced by the aging of many economies’ workforces – options for reskilling and lifelong education must be scaled up.
This will demand innovations in the content, delivery, and financing of training, as well as new models for public-private partnerships.
The potential of technology-enabled solutions must be harnessed, supported by a stronger foundation of digital literacy.
At a time of rising inequality – in the US, for example, gaps in higher education attainment by family income level have widened – a strong commitment to improving access for the economically disadvantaged is also vital.
At the same time, countries must facilitate workers’ ability to change jobs through reforms to their labor markets and social safety nets.
This means shifting the focus from backward-looking labor-market policies, which seek to protect workers in existing jobs, to future-oriented measures, such as innovative insurance mechanisms and active labor-market policies.
Moreover, social contracts based on formal long-term employer-employee relationships will need to be overhauled, with benefits such as retirement and health care made more portable and adapted to evolving work arrangements, including the expanding “gig” economy.
Here, several proposals have already been put forward, including a universal basic income, currently being piloted in Finland and some sub-national jurisdictions such as Ontario, Canada; a negative income tax; and various types of portable social security accounts that pool workers’ benefits.
On both of these fronts, France is setting a positive example.
Early this year, the country launched a portable “personal activity account,” which enables workers to accrue rights to training across multiple jobs, rather than accumulating such rights only within a specific position or company.
President Emmanuel Macron’s administration is now undertaking reforms to France’s stringent job protections, in order to boost labor-market flexibility.
Pursuing such initiatives simultaneously will enable France to capture reform synergies and ease the adjustment for workers.
Technological change will continue to pose momentous challenges to labor markets across economies, just as it has in the past.
But, with smart, forward-looking policies, we can meet those challenges head on – and ensure that the future of work is a better job.
A Volvo Moment for Antimicrobial Resistance
LONDON – Last week, Volvo issued an inspiring announcement: it will no longer produce gasoline- or diesel-fueled cars after 2019.
Volvo executives may be anticipating that traditional vehicles will be less profitable in the future.
But whatever their motive, their decision has resonated widely.
Within 24 hours, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would prohibit the sale of gasoline- and diesel-fueled cars by 2040.
Volvo’s decision confirms that things are changing for the auto industry, and it sends a positive message in the fight against climate change.
But, more important, it demonstrates that people and organizations are still capable of taking big, bold steps to solve major challenges.
Among the many global problems today, the fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) desperately needs a similar breakthrough commitment.
For advocates, AMR’s appearance on the G20’s agenda last year, at the group’s summit in Hangzhou, China, represented a major triumph.
But G20 leaders’ 2016 statement on AMR was not as bold as it could have been, because they did not want to set the bar too high.
They knew that Germany, an enthusiastic champion in the fight against AMR, would be chairing the G20 this year, and could be expected to bring bold proposals to the table.
In the run-up to this year’s G20 summit in Hamburg, I started to worry that Germany would fall short of these expectations.
But, if anything, Germany under-promised and over-delivered.
The lengthy communiqué issued at the end of the Hamburg summit includes a statement on AMR that is bolder than I would have expected.
Not only have G20 leaders reaffirmed their previous support for efforts by the World Health Organization, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, and the Organization for Animal Health to tackle AMR. They have also taken important steps in three crucial areas: agricultural usage, diagnostics, and the market for new useful drugs.
There are clear opportunities for breakthrough commitments in each of these three areas.
In agriculture, G20 countries have promised to restrict the use of antibiotics outside of veterinary medicine.
That alone is a big step forward, given that, in big countries such as the United States, and possibly China and India, antibiotics are now used more for growth promotion in agriculture than for fighting infections in humans.
The European Union has prohibited this practice for a decade now, but its policy has not spread globally because vested interests in major food-producing countries have stood in the way.
Still, countries such as the US and Brazil could now have their own “Volvo moments”: policymakers simply need to tell food producers what will and will not be allowed.
And the private sector, too, needs to show leadership on this front.
Food producers and retailers should follow in the footsteps of the Devon-based bacon producer that recently committed to using only antibiotic-free pigs.
Will Walmart, Asda, Tesco, and others now do the same?
To win the war against AMR, we must stop doling out antibiotics like sweets.
To that end, we will need new technologies and other measures to change how antibiotics are prescribed and administered.
For example, in the Review on AMR, which I chaired, we urged developed countries to require, by 2020, that certain diagnostic tests be conducted before antibiotics can be prescribed.
By enacting such a policy, any developed country can now establish itself as a global leader.
So, too, can companies that commit to providing the necessary diagnostic technology at an affordable price, or pharmaceutical companies that support such technologies as a complement to new gram-negative antibiotics, which will have to be set at a higher price to discourage overuse.
Which pharmaceutical company will be the Volvo or Tesla of its industry?
If one company takes the lead on developing new drugs to respond to antibiotic-resistant pathogens that the WHO has identified as urgent priorities, it will free others from their conventional strait jackets, and force them to stop thinking so narrowly about quarterly returns.
In the Review on AMR, we recommended 27 interventions that could solve the AMR crisis for a generation.
So far this decade, however, three US-based pharmaceutical manufacturers have already spent more money buying back their own shares than would be needed to see those interventions through.
Pharmaceutical companies have essentially become balance-sheet managers first, and drug makers second.
Someone needs to flip that model on its head.
The Review also proposed market-entry rewards to encourage innovation. If the major pharmaceutical producers were to make meaningful investments in antibiotics research, they could vastly improve the current environment for developing new drugs.
The G20’s proposed “R&D Collaboration Hub” will, one hopes, help in this effort.
Only when the industry comes together will AMR go the way of the gasoline- and diesel-powered car.
The G20’s Time for Climate Leadership
PARIS – At the start of 2016, the United States was well positioned to lead the global fight against climate change.
As the chair of the G20 for 2017, German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been counting on the US to help drive a deep transformation in the global economy.
And even after Donald Trump won the US presidential election, Merkel gave him the benefit of the doubt, hoping against hope that the US might still play a leading role in reducing global greenhouse-gas emissions.
But at Merkel and Trump’s first in-person meeting, no substantive statements were issued, and their body language made the prospect of future dialogue appear dim.
Trump’s slogan “America first” seems to mean “America alone.”
By reversing his predecessor’s policies to reduce CO2 emissions, Trump is rolling back the new model of cooperative global governance embodied in the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
The countries that signed on to that accord committed themselves to sharing the risks and benefits of a global economic and technological transformation.
Trump’s climate-change policy does not bode well for US citizens – many of whom are now mobilizing resistance to his administration – or the world.
But the rest of the world will still develop low-carbon, resilient systems.
Private- and public-sector players across the developed and developing worlds are making the coming economic shift all but inevitable, and their agendas will not change simply because the US has a capricious new administration.
China, India, the European Union, and many African and Latin American countries are still adopting clean-energy systems.
As long as this is the case, businesses, local governments, and other stakeholders will continue to pursue low-carbon strategies.
To be sure, Trump’s policies might introduce new dangers and costs, domestically and worldwide; but he will not succeed in prolonging the fossil-fuel era.
Still, an effective US exit from the Paris agreement is a menacing development.
The absence of such an important player from the fight against climate change could undermine new forms of multilateralism, even if it reinvigorates climate activism as global public opinion turns against the US.
More immediately, the Trump administration has introduced significant financial risks that could impede efforts to address climate change.
Trump’s proposed budget would place restrictions on federal funding for clean-energy development and climate research.
Likewise, his recent executive orders will minimize the financial costs of US businesses’ carbon footprint, by changing how the “social cost of carbon” is calculated.
And his administration has already insisted that language about climate change be omitted from a joint statement issued by G20 finance ministers.
These are all unwise decisions that pose serious risks to the US economy, and to global stability, as United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres recently pointed out.
The US financial system plays a leading role in the world economy, and Trump wants to take us all back to a time when investors and the general public did not account for climate-change risks when making financial decisions.
Since 2008, the regulatory approach taken by the US and the G20 has been geared toward increasing transparency and improving our understanding of possible systemic risks to the global financial system, not least those associated with climate change and fossil-fuel dependency.
Developing more stringent transparency rules and better risk-assessment tools has been a top priority for the financial community itself.
Implementing these new rules and tools can accelerate the overall trend in divestment from fossil fuels, ensure a smooth transition to a more resilient, clean-energy economy, and provide confidence and clarity for long-term investors.
Given the heightened financial risks associated with climate change, resisting Trump’s executive order to roll back Wall Street transparency regulations should be a top priority.
The fact that Warren Buffet and the asset-management firm Black Rock have warned about the investment risks of climate change suggests that the battle is not yet lost.
Creating the G20 was a good idea.
Now, it must confront its biggest challenge.
It is up to Merkel and other G20 leaders to overcome US (and Saudi) resistance and stay the course on climate action.
They can count as allies some of the world’s large institutional investors, who seem to agree on the need for a transitional framework of self-regulation.
It is incumbent upon other world leaders to devise a coherent response to Trump, and to continue establishing a new development paradigm that is compatible across different financial systems.
At the same time, the EU – which is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome this year – now has a chance to think about the future that it wants to build.
These are difficult times, to be sure; but we can still decide what kind of world we want to live in.
The G20 Embraces Green Finance
BEIJING – The G20’s finance ministers and central-bank governors have begun to undertake a stunning shift in mindset.
They have become increasingly convinced that “green finance” – financing environmentally sustainable growth – should be at the center of economic-development strategies.
Such an idea, until recently confined to a fringe of academics and policymakers, is potentially one of the most important new “truths” of the twenty-first century.
The conventional economic-development model viewed environmental protection as a “luxury good” that societies could afford only after they became rich.
Such thinking explains why the dramatic growth in global income, 80-fold in real terms during the last century, has been accompanied by a decline, according to the United Nations Environment Programme, in natural capital in 127 of 140 countries.
But natural capital is not just an abstract concept; it supports lives, livelihoods, and societal wellbeing.
The environmental destruction that our activities are wreaking – greenhouse-gas emissions add energy to the Earth system at a rate equivalent to the detonation of four nuclear bombs every second – has concrete consequences, which are already being borne by millions of people.
Since 2008, an average of 26.4 million people have been displaced from their homes by natural disasters each year – equivalent to almost one person every second.
One-third of the world’s arable land is now jeopardized by land degradation, which causes economic losses of $6.3-10.6 trillion per year.
And 21 of the world’s 37 largest aquifers have passed their sustainability tipping point.
The downsides of the conventional approach to economic development, which favors income and employment over environmental protection, are particularly apparent in China.
By some measures – in particular, per capita income and GDP growth – China’s development process has been an extraordinary success.
But it has also brought lethal levels of air pollution and extensive contamination and depletion of land and water.
The good news is that Chinese leaders now seem to recognize that they must safeguard the environment before China achieves high-income status.
Indeed, they have moved to the forefront of the green-finance movement.
To be sure, the challenge facing China is monumental.
Success will require an estimated $600 billion in investment each year, in areas including environmental remediation and protection, renewable energies and energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation systems.
Given that less than 15% of that finance will come from public sources, China will also have to retool its financial system to support private investment.
But China is already taking concrete steps in the right direction.
On August 30, President Xi Jinping presided over a decision by the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms to transform China’s financial system to facilitate green investment.
The so-called “guidelines for establishing a green finance system” adopted at the meeting represent the world’s first attempt at an integrated policy package to promote an ambitious shift toward a green economy.
According to the guidelines, China will have to develop a wide range of new financial instruments, including green credit, green development funds, green bonds, green equity index products, green insurance, and carbon finance.
It must also introduce a host of specific policies, regulations, and incentives, including innovative use of the central bank’s relending operations, interest subsidies, and guarantees.
And it must establish a national-level Green Development Fund, much like the United Kingdom’s Green Investment Bank.
How this process unfolds in China will hold important lessons for others seeking to build more sustainable economies.
But some governments are not hesitating to make their own way.
From the City of London’s Green Finance Initiative to Indonesia’s Sustainable Finance Roadmap, innovative policy packages are emerging at an accelerating pace.
Moreover, many of the world’s stock exchanges have committed to requiring listed companies to report on their sustainable development risks.
And a coalition of banking regulators has emerged to explore how to advance green credit.
Details vary by country, but the goal is a common one: to align capital markets with the financing needs of an inclusive, sustainable economy.
The G20’s agenda, which aims to promote strong, sustainable, and balanced economic growth, should now be updated to reflect this shared goal, with green finance becoming a key component of the G20’s business.
This week’s summit in China is the ideal place to start.
The G20’s Harmony Without Trump
MEDELLÍN – O Freunde, nicht diese Töne! (Oh friends, not these sounds!), proclaimed the baritone in the stirring performance of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony to the G20 leaders in Hamburg last Friday evening.
That soul-stirring phrase, the opening line of “Ode to Joy,” Beethoven’s appeal to universal brotherhood, was the perfect message to the global leaders sitting in the concert hall’s balcony.
The G20 President, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, actually made remarkable headway in channeling Beethoven’s spirit.
This G20 summit, of course, was the first with Donald Trump as US President.
The summit’s discordant tones, echoed in the stormy sections of Beethoven’s symphony, emanated entirely from the United States.
Trump has no use for appeals to brotherly love.
He traffics in ethnic and religious divisiveness, hostility to neighbors (insisting again at the summit that the US will build a wall on the Mexican border and that Mexico will pay for it), and Manichean images of a Western civilization vulnerable to collapse at the hands of radical Islam, rather than at the height of unimaginable wealth and technological prowess.
While the conductor led the orchestra in a breathtaking performance, the true maestro of the evening was Merkel.
What a stroke of genius to bring the G20 leaders to Hamburg’s spectacular new Elbphilharmonie concert hall, itself a triumph of architectural vision, to be inspired by perhaps the greatest musical work of universal culture, with its message of world harmony.
The concert itself offered layer upon layer of significance.
The Germany of Beethoven has been reborn on the ashes of the Germany of Hitler.
Germany today is a globally admired, peace-loving, war-abhorring, democratic, prosperous, innovative, and cooperative country.
At the same time, Beethoven’s genius belongs not only to his native Germany, or even to the West, but to all of humanity.
His scoring of Schiller’s poetic ode reflects the truly global aspirations of the Enlightenment.
Yes, the Enlightenment was a European phenomenon; but it was utterly aware of the entire world and of the dangers of particularism and chauvinism.
In Germany, it was imbued with Immanuel Kant’s vision of “perpetual peace,” grounded in the “categorical imperative” to act according to maxims that can be made into a universal law, rather than according to personal whims and narrow self-interest.
Trump’s “America First” is a brazen affront to Kantian ethics and a threat to peace.
His break with the rest of the world on the Paris climate agreement is his most chilling act of naked self-interest so far.
Its origin lies in the aim of a few US companies – led by Koch Industries, Continental Resources, Peabody Energy, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and a few others – to maximize profits from gas and oil fracking, deep-sea drilling, and continued coal mining and use, the climate consequences be damned.
These fossil-fuel companies have financed the campaigns of the Republican representatives and senators who called on Trump to withdraw from the Paris accord.
They, and the Republican politicians on their payroll, are prepared to sacrifice the wellbeing of fellow Americans, even their own families, not to mention the rest of the world and future generations.
Greed über alles.
The question ahead of the G20 summit was therefore clear: Would other countries follow the US in recklessly putting self-interest above the common good?
Rumors were flying.
The New York Times ran a curtain raiser suggesting that Trump might succeed in pulling Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and even Indonesia into a petrostate coalition to weaken or overturn the Paris agreement.
For this reason, the future of global cooperation was at stake in Hamburg.
It had taken many years – by one plausible accounting a full generation since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit – to reach the Paris climate agreement, unanimously adopted by all 193 UN member states in December 2015.
Could the US oil lobby, with their political lackeys in tow, send the world back to square one?
Merkel proved once again to be a bulwark of reason and efficiency.
She did not panic, raise her voice, or make demands.
But she made clear where she, Germany, and Europe stood.
Following the G7 meeting in late May, she lamented that Europe could no longer fully rely on the US.
Behind the scenes, she and the highly professional Germany diplomatic corps worked overtime to secure consensus – minus America – at the G20.
As the G20 leaders headed to the concert on Friday, their Sherpas stayed behind to debate the final text.
Would Russia, Saudi Arabia, and others play Trump’s game?
When the communiqué appeared, diplomats and climate activists around the world breathed a sigh of relief.
All other G20 countries had resisted the US ploy.
The communiqué was simple, accurate, and reassuring on climate change: “The Leaders of the other G20 members state that the Paris Agreement is irreversible….We reaffirm our strong commitment to the Paris Agreement, moving swiftly towards its full implementation…”
The communiqué does contain a paragraph of Trump doublespeak.
The US affirmed “its strong commitment to an approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs,” and would “work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and help deploy renewable and other clean energy sources.”
As a teenager might say, “Whatever.”
On several other global issues, a full consensus was reached.
The G20 reaffirmed that “international trade and investment are important engines of growth, productivity, innovation, job creation, and development.”
All G20 leaders recommitted their countries to universal health coverage (another clear message to Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and House Speaker Paul Ryan), and to strengthening health systems.
They reiterated their commitment to sustainable development and to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
When the concert ended, the G20 leaders and the rest of the theater rose to their feet in a prolonged standing ovation.
The curtain call truly belonged to Beethoven, Kant, and Merkel.
The Age of Megaprojects
WASHINGTON, DC – We seem to be entering a new age of megaprojects, as countries, in particular those of the G-20, mobilize the private sector to invest heavily in multi-million (if not multi-billion or multi-trillion) dollar infrastructure initiatives, such as pipelines, dams, water and electricity systems, and road networks.
Already, spending on megaprojects amounts to some $6-9 trillion a year, roughly 8% of global GDP, making this the “biggest investment boom in human history.”
And geopolitics, the pursuit of economic growth, the quest for new markets, and the search for natural resources is driving even more funding into large-scale infrastructure projects.
On the cusp of this potentially unprecedented explosion in such projects, world leaders and lenders appear relatively oblivious to the costly lessons of the past.
To be sure, investments in infrastructure can serve real needs, helping meet an expected surge in the demand for food, water, and energy.
But, unless the explosion in megaprojects is carefully redirected and managed, the effort is likely to be counterproductive and unsustainable.
Without democratic controls, investors may privatize gains and socialize losses, while locking in carbon-intensive and other environmentally and socially damaging approaches.
To begin with, there is the issue of cost effectiveness.
Rather than adopting a “small is beautiful” or a “bigger is better” philosophy, countries must build “appropriate scale” infrastructure suited to its purposes.
Bent Flyvbjerg, a professor at the University of Oxford specialized in program management and planning, studied 70 years of data to conclude that there is an “iron law of megaprojects”: they are almost invariably “over budget, over time, over and over again.”
They are also, he adds, subject to the “survival of the unfittest,” with the worst projects getting built, instead of the best.
This risk is augmented by the fact that these megaprojects are driven largely by geopolitics – not careful economics.
From 2000 to 2014, as global GDP more than doubled to $75 trillion, the G-7 countries’ share of the world economy dropped from 65% to 45%.
As the international arena adjusts to this rebalancing, the United States has begun to worry that its hegemony will be challenged by new players and institutions, such as the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
In reaction, the Western-led institutions, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, are aggressively expanding their infrastructure investment operations, and are openly calling for a paradigm shift.
The G-20, too, is accelerating the launch of megaprojects, in the hope of boosting global growth rates by at least 2% by 2018.
The OECD estimates that an additional $70 trillion in infrastructure will be needed by 2030 – an average expenditure of a little more than $4.5 trillion per year.
By comparison, it would take an estimated $2-3 trillion per year to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.
Clearly, with megaprojects, the potential for waste, corruption, and the buildup of unsustainable public debts is high.
The second issue that must be considered is planetary boundaries.
In a March 2015 letter to the G-20, a group of scientists, environmentalists, and opinion leaders warned that ramping up investment in megaprojects risks irreversible and catastrophic damage to the environment.
“Each year, we are already consuming about one-and-a-half planets’ worth of resources,” the authors explained. “Infrastructure choices need to be made to alleviate rather than exacerbate this situation.”
Similarly, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change cautions that “infrastructure developments and long-lived products that lock societies into greenhouse-gas-intensive emissions pathways may be difficult or very costly to change.”
And, indeed, the G-20 has put in place few social, environmental, or climate-related criteria for the “wish list” of mega-projects that each member country will submit to its summit in Turkey in November.
The third potential problem with megaprojects is their reliance on public-private partnerships.
As part of the renewed focus on large-scale investments, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and other multilateral lenders have launched an effort to reengineer development finance by, among other things, creating new asset classes of social and economic infrastructure to attract private investment.
“We need to tap into the trillions of dollars held by institutional investors… and direct those assets into projects,” said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim.
By using public money to offset risk, the institutions hope to attract long-term institutional investors – including mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds, and sovereign-wealth funds – who together control an estimated $93 trillion in assets.
Their hope is that tapping this huge pool of capital will enable them to scale-up infrastructure and transform development finance in ways that would have been previously unimaginable.
The trouble is that public-private partnerships are required to provide a competitive return on investment.
As result, according to researchers at the London School of Economics, they “are not regarded as an appropriate instrument for [information technology] projects, or where social concerns place a constraint on the user charges that might make a project interesting for the private sector.”
Private investors seek to sustain the rate of return on their investments through guaranteed revenue streams and by ensuring that laws and regulations (including environmental and social requirements) do not cut into their profits.
The risk is that the quest for profit will undermine the public good.
Finally, the rules governing long-term investment do not effectively incorporate long-term environmental and social related risks, as emphasized by trade unions and the United Nations Environment Program.
Pooling infrastructure investments in portfolios or turning development sectors into asset classes could privatize gains and socialize losses on a massive scale.
This dynamic can increase levels of inequality and undermine democracy, owing to the lack of leverage that governments – much less citizens – may have over institutional investors.
In general, trade rules and agreements compound these problems by putting the interests of investors over those of ordinary citizens.
Left unexamined, the push toward megaprojects risks – in the words of the authors of the letter to the G-20 – “doubling down on a dangerous vision.” It is critical that we ensure that any transformation of development finance be crafted in a way that upholds human rights and protects the earth.
The G20’s Misguided Globalism
HAMBURG – This year’s G20 summit in Hamburg promises to be among the more interesting in recent years.
For one thing, US President Donald Trump, who treats multilateralism and international cooperation with cherished disdain, will be attending for the first time.
Trump comes to Hamburg having already walked out of one of the key commitments from last year’s summit – to join the Paris climate agreement “as soon as possible.”
And he will not have much enthusiasm for these meetings’ habitual exhortation to foreswear protectionism or provide greater assistance to refugees.
Moreover, the Hamburg summit follows two G20 annual meetings in authoritarian countries – Turkey in 2015 and China in 2016 – where protests could be stifled.
This year’s summit promises to be an occasion for raucous street demonstrations, directed against not only Trump, but also Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Russia’s Vladimir Putin.
The G20 has its origins in two ideas, one relevant and important, the other false and distracting.
The relevant and important idea is that developing and emerging market economies such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and China have become too significant to be excluded from discussions about global governance.
While the G7 has not been replaced – its last summit was held in May in Sicily – G20 meetings are an occasion to expand and broaden the dialogue.
The G20 was created in 1999, in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.
Developed countries initially treated it as an outreach forum, where they would help developing economies raise financial and monetary management to the developed world’s standards.
Over time, developing countries found their own voice and have played a larger role in crafting the group’s agenda.
In any case, the 2008 global financial crisis emanating from the United States, and the subsequent eurozone debacle, made a mockery of the idea that developed countries had much useful knowledge to impart on these matters.
The second, less useful idea underpinning the G20 is that solving the pressing problems of the world economy requires ever more intense cooperation and coordination at the global level.
The analogy frequently invoked is that the world economy is a “global commons”: either all countries do their share to contribute to its upkeep, or they will all suffer the consequences.
This rings true and certainly applies to some areas.
Addressing climate change, to take a key problem, does indeed require collective action.
Cutting carbon dioxide emissions is a true global public good, because every country, left to its own devices, would rather free ride on others’ cuts while doing very little at home.
Similarly, infectious diseases that travel across borders require global investments in early-warning systems, monitoring, and prevention.
Here, too, individual countries have little incentive to contribute to those investments and every incentive for free riding on others’ contributions.
It is a small step from such arguments to consider the G20’s bread-and-butter economic issues – financial stability, macroeconomic management, trade policies, structural reform – in the same vein.
But the global-commons logic largely breaks down with such economic problems.
Consider the topic that will be on all G20 leaders’ minds in Hamburg (except for Trump’s, of course): the threat of rising trade protectionism.
A new report from Global Trade Alert warns that the G20 has failed to live up to its previous pledges on this issue.
So far, Trump’s bark has been worse than his bite on trade.
Nonetheless, the report argues, the thousands of protectionist measures that still impede US exports in other countries may well give Trump the excuse he needs to increase barriers of his own.
Yet the failure to maintain open trade policies is not really a failure of global cooperation or a result of insufficient global spirit.
It is essentially a failure of domestic policy.
When we economists teach the principle of comparative advantage and the gains from trade, we explain that free trade expands the home country’s economic pie.
We trade not to confer benefits on other countries, but to enhance our own citizens’ economic opportunities.
Responding to other countries’ protectionism by erecting barriers of our own amounts to shooting ourselves in the foot.
True, trade agreements have not brought benefits to a large number of Americans; many workers and communities have been hurt.
But the skewed and unbalanced trade deals that produced these results were not imposed on the US by other countries.
They were what powerful US corporate and financial interests – the same ones that support Trump – demanded and managed to obtain.
The failure to compensate the losers was not the result of inadequate global cooperation, either; it was a deliberate domestic policy choice.
The same goes for financial regulation, macroeconomic stability or growth-promoting structural reforms.
When governments misbehave in these areas, they may produce adverse spillovers for other countries.
But it is their own citizens who pay the greatest price.
Exhortations at G20 summits will not fix any of these problems.
If we want to avoid misguided protectionism, or to benefit from better economic management in general, we need to start by putting our own national houses in order.
Worse still, the knee-jerk globalism that suffuses G20 meetings feeds into the populists’ narrative.
It provides justification for Trump and like-minded leaders to deflect attention from their own policies and lay the blame on others.
It is because other countries break the rules and take advantage of us, they can say, that our people suffer.
Globalism-as-solution is easily transformed into globalism-as-scapegoat.
The reality, as a latter-day Caesar might put it, is that the fault is not in our trade partners, but in ourselves.
A G20 Refugee Agenda
DHAKA – Every day, an average of some 34,000 people are forced to flee natural or man-made disasters.
In the last six months alone, more than 2,000 lives have been lost in the Mediterranean; over the last weekend in June, 12,600 migrants arrived in Italy by sea.
Financial and political pressures are overwhelming the countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe that are on the receiving end of this human wave.
Unfortunately, in many cases, help is not on the way.
The scale of forced migration today has revealed troubling flaws in the organizations intended to serve as the last line of defense.
Weak mandates, insufficient funding, disorganized structures, and the absence of a global governance system have weakened intergovernmental agencies’ ability to act with authority in the name of the most vulnerable.
As I argue in Germany this week, G20 leaders meeting in Hamburg on July 7-8 have an opportunity to reshape the migration governance system with proactive protection policies that would enhance people’s trust in international leadership.
Although past summits have produced little more than talking points, the prospect for action is better this time, given that the talks will be held in Europe, where the impact of the migration crisis has been deeply felt.
At the moment, an alphabet soup of nonprofit and multilateral agencies tackles elements of the challenge.
These include independent groups like Refugees International (IR) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Even the World Trade Organization (WTO) plays a role in managing economic migration.
But at the intergovernmental level, the two most important players – the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) – are also under the greatest strain.
For the UNHCR, the challenges are systemic.
For starters, it lacks broad enforcement powers, and must rely on government cooperation, which is not always guaranteed in conflict zones – or forthcoming from neighboring states.
Countries that ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention have never fully adhered to it in practice, which limits the UNHCR’s ability to act.
UNHCR interventions fail when countries are uncooperative, as we saw with Haitian and Cuban migrations to the United States in recent decades.
But the UNHCR also suffers from internal shortcomings.
Its communication with refugees on the ground is inconsistent.
While an increase in UNHCR protection officers would help, it is equally important that the agency get its facts straight.
For example, when host countries move to repatriate refugee populations forcibly, without informing the UNHCR, the agency itself looks unreliable, if not incompetent.
The UNHCR, as currently conceived is not the independent, nonpartisan agency it claims to be.
Heavily dependent on donors and host governments to launch relief operations, it is beholden to their interests and does not always have the political support it needs to get the job done.
The other major multilateral migration agency, the IOM, assists in the return of migrants, asylum seekers, refugees, and the internally displaced to their place of origin, or to other countries or regions that have agreed to accept them.
But, like the UNHCR, governance issues plague the IOM.
In particular, the IOM lacks a mechanism to evaluate whether national governments are using coercion – banned under international law – to repatriate or relocate refugees.
Nor does the IOM have the capacity to assess the safety of areas to which refugees are returning.
Millions of people benefit from IOM-sponsored programs and projects, but prior to joining the UN structure as a “related organization” in September 2016, the IOM had no formal mandate to protect the rights of migrants.
And even as a UN-related entity, the IOM suffers a mismatch between its broad mission and its meager budget and staff.
It has been held to a “zero growth” standard in recent years, even as demand for its programs has increased.
And, because its work is largely project-based, with member states funding specific activities, its role in mitigating refugee crises is largely reliant on individual members’ preferences and priorities.
As key guardians of the world’s refugees, these two organizations must adapt to today’s challenges.
Proactive policies on interagency coordination and financial burden sharing are essential.
Elements of the Refugee Convention, like language on asylum policies, also should be updated to reflect current realities, and both agencies need to develop holistic and consistent policies on refugee advocacy and protection.
To this end, the member states of both organizations should support their continued integration within the UN structure, which would give them more tools to influence the causes, not just the effects, of forced displacement.
These are just a few of the governance upgrades that I have recommended for the G20.
Both the UNHCR and the IOM could benefit from stronger multilateral support, and the G20 is uniquely poised to offer it.
If we cannot end war, famine, corruption, or poverty, then the next best solution is to improve the organizations helping those who flee them.
The Global Economy’s Stealth Resilience
OXFORD – Last week, Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund’s managing director, warned that if countries do not act together, the global economy could be derailed.
Likewise, the OECD has warned that countries must move “urgently” and “collectively” to boost global growth prospects.
Yet the G-20 finance ministers and central-bank governors to whom these entreaties were directed failed to agree any such action at their recent meeting in Shanghai.
To be sure, the communiqué released after the meeting includes a pledge to use “all policy tools – monetary, fiscal, and structural – individually and collectively” to “foster confidence and preserve and strengthen the recovery.”
But the communiqué also reflects distinct divisions – particularly with regard to the role of monetary and fiscal policy in stimulating growth – among the finance ministers and central bankers who agreed on its text.
On monetary policy, the communiqué offers the empty statement that the G-20 would “continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability, consistent with central banks’ mandates.”
That avoided the central question: Should central banks be attempting to stimulate growth through “unconventional” monetary policies?
The Bank for International Settlements thinks not, arguing in its 2015 annual report that “monetary policy has been overburdened” in an attempt to reinvigorate growth, a reality that is reflected in “the persistence of ultra-low interest rates.”
The result is a vicious cycle of too much debt, too little growth, and too-low interest rates that, to quote the BIS’s Claudio Borio, “beget lower rates.”
This sobering analysis has not stopped the Bank of Japan or the European Central Bank from further monetary easing.
Nor did it deter People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan from expressing a willingness to shoulder more of the growth-stimulating burden in Shanghai.
But not everyone is ignoring the writing on the wall.
Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan has called on the IMF to examine the effects of unconventional monetary policy not just on the countries that implement them, but also on the rest of the world.
Likewise, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has pointed out that countries using negative interest rates (including, most recently, Japan) are, by forcing currency devaluation, exporting weak demand – ultimately a zero-sum game.
When it comes to fiscal policy, agreement is similarly lacking.
The IMF is urging surplus countries like Germany to pursue more stimulus.
The OECD, too, has called upon its wealthier members to take advantage of their current ability to borrow for long periods at very low interest rates to increase growth-enhancing investment in infrastructure.
These calls provoked a sharp rebuttal from German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, who condemned the “debt-financed growth model.”
The result of this conflict was a vague declaration by the G-20 that it would use “fiscal-policy flexibly to strengthen growth, job creation, and confidence, while enhancing resilience and ensuring debt as a share of GDP is on a sustainable path.”
In light of the statements by the IMF and the OECD, this distinct failure to agree on monetary and fiscal policy seems highly dangerous.
But both institutions may be overstating the problem.
In fact, despite widespread uncertainty – volatile capital flows, plummeting commodity prices, escalating geopolitical tensions, the shock of a potential British exit from the European Union, and a massive refugee crisis – the stalling of global cooperation may be less risky today than it was even a decade ago.
The key factor in this context has been widespread recognition of the risks inherent in economic globalization, and concerted efforts to build up the needed resilience on a national, bilateral, or regional basis.
Consider finance.
Twenty years ago, a catastrophic financial crisis began in Thailand and quickly spread across East Asia.
Since then, those economies, and others in the emerging world, have self-insured against crisis by building up huge stockpiles of foreign-exchange reserves.
Partly as a result of this, the volume of reserves has risen from some 5% of world GDP in 1995 to around 15% today.
Emerging economies are also holding less sovereign debt, and they have created bilateral and regional currency-swap arrangements.
In addition, more than 40 countries have deployed macroprudential measures since the 2008 global financial crisis.
Countries also benefit from greater access to more diversified sources of finance.
Some emerging and developing countries now access global bond markets individually.
And the role of regional development banks – including the African, Asian, and Inter-American Development Banks, as well as the newly created Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank – has grown.
The final manifestation of this new pattern of cooperation – which might be called “distributed governance” – appears in trade.
While the Doha Round of negotiations has staggered and fallen, liberalization is proceeding apace, owing to the proliferation of bilateral, regional, and super-regional deals.
These new governance arrangements have important resilience-enhancing effects; but they may not offer a more efficient alternative to multilateralism, and they do not eliminate the need for traditional multilateral institutions.
On the contrary, bodies like the IMF, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization should be responsible for analyzing and transmitting vital information to the array of institutions that are filling their traditional role.
For example, the IMF should respond to Rajan’s request to track and analyze the effects of unconventional monetary policies.
Likewise, it could strengthen its analysis of the impact of capital controls on the countries implementing them, and on other countries.
It could also resume preparing models of how sovereign-debt restructuring could be better supported – whether at the national level, through GDP-linked or contingent convertible bonds, or at the regional or global level.
At their Shanghai meeting, G-20 policymakers vowed to adopt a range of policy tools to boost global growth and avoid currency wars.
They did not deliver on that promise.
But their failure may have reinforced the shift to a new phase of distributed global economic governance.
A Plutocrats Summit?
BRISBANE – At an official dinner in Washington, DC, ahead of November’s G-20 Summit in Brisbane, Australia-born media mogul Rupert Murdoch lectured ministers on the dangers of socialism and big government.
A fervent opponent of Australia’s carbon price, and a battle-hardened opponent of US President Barack Obama, Murdoch lauded the virtues of austerity and minimal regulation, and railed against the corrosive effects of social safety nets.
The ministers were in Washington to attend the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where they attempted to thrash out differences and establish common ground before the upcoming summit.
The tone set by Murdoch, however, suggests that a consensus on sustainable, inclusive growth will be hard to achieve.
Murdoch’s comments are in keeping with views expressed by his friend, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, and Abbott’s current administration.
In January, for example, Abbott informed a startled Davos conference that the global financial crisis was caused not by unregulated global markets, but rather by too much governance.
This was certainly news to the finance ministers who had spent the past few years struggling with the toxic fallout from financial-sector excess.
Viewed in the context of such comments, one can better understand Australia’s refusal to put issues of climate change and inclusive prosperity on the Brisbane agenda.
Of course, stimulating global growth is a big enough challenge in itself, even without considering inclusiveness or environmental sustainability.
The IMF’s gloomy growth forecasts attest to that.
And many policymakers view Australia’s G-20 chairmanship as an opportunity to re-energize and refine the group’s mission to boost global growth, create jobs, and raise living standards.
G-20 finance ministers have already decided on a 2% target for annual growth through 2018, and are sifting through more than 900 proposals for structural reforms in order to achieve this.
What reforms G-20 members propose in Brisbane, and how serious they will be about implementing them, remains to be seen.
The bigger challenge, though, is hitting those growth targets in a sustainable and inclusive way.
If structural reforms are not done right, the Brisbane Summit will come to be regarded as a failure.
Structural reforms, in which certain interests are sacrificed for the greater good, will always be controversial and difficult to execute.
But when such reforms involve sacrifices by ordinary citizens and benefit society’s most privileged groups, political gridlock and instability invariably follow.
Over the past two years, academics, regulators, economists, and financial institutions have all linked the secular stagnation in demand with greater income inequality.
It is ironic that, at a time when many in the developing world are entering, or aspire to enter, the emerging middle class, wealth in much of the developed world is becoming more concentrated at the top.
Indeed, inequality of outcomes both in emerging and advanced economies has increased within and across generations.
Australia’s refusal to discuss inclusive growth in Brisbane may please plutocrats like Murdoch, but talk of unregulated markets, lower taxes, and the removal of social safety nets strongly indicates that the summit will offer no substantive policies aimed at reducing inequality.
With just days to go until the Brisbane meeting, the G-20 is ignoring the main long-term threats to the global economy.
As the Bank of England’s Governor Mark Carney (who I assume also heard Murdoch’s lecture) remarked earlier this year, “[U]nchecked market fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential for the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself.”
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde recently put it more starkly, noting that the world’s 85 richest people control more wealth than the world’s 3.5 billion poorest people, and that this degree of inequality is casting a dark shadow over the global economy.
Inequality is not a fringe issue.
Combating its rise is essential to achieving sustainable economic growth and political stability.
The G-20’s real power is to highlight such challenges and generate informed debate on the issues as a prelude to action.
The question now is which leader in Brisbane, if any, will grab the global megaphone and speak out.
Realizing the Potential of China’s G20 Presidency
NEW YORK – In the run-up to this September’s G20 summit in Hangzhou, China, there has been much talk about strengthening global macroeconomic cooperation and reforming the international monetary system.
While this is far from the first time these topics have come up – in 2011, for example, France pushed for monetary reform, but was waylaid by the eurozone crisis – the time may be ripe for genuine progress.
Today’s global economy is plagued by uncertainty.
Inconsistent data have lately raised questions about the strength of the United States’ economy.
When it comes to Japan, the data are even more erratic. The European Union faces not only a still-weak recovery, but also the possibility of losing the United Kingdom as a member.
The emerging world, meanwhile, is experiencing a sharp economic slowdown.
China, in particular, poses a significant risk, with many fearing that its downturn will be more severe than initially anticipated.
This has spurred many to move their capital out of the country, generating strong downward pressure on the renminbi.
This highlights another source of uncertainty today: exchange rates.
From the euro’s decline in 2014-2015 to the US dollar’s decline after the Federal Reserve signaled a postponement of its rate increases to the British pound’s recent drop, spurred by uncertainty surrounding the recent referendum on EU membership, major currencies have been all over the map in recent years.
Some have even mooted suspicions of competitive devaluation.
At a time when a policy change in one country reverberates throughout the global economy, stronger cooperation could be vital to enhancing overall stability.
And, indeed, to some extent, world leaders have already recognized this imperative.
Since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, many initiatives aimed at boosting macroeconomic cooperation have been undertaken.
For example, the G20 launched the Mutual Assessment Process, whereby member countries are evaluated on the basis of agreed indicators.
The International Monetary Fund’s surveillance of macroeconomic policies has also been enhanced, with the implementation of a new set of multilateral surveillance tools that focus on major economies.
These reforms, it has been said, make for the most elaborate system of multilateral macroeconomic cooperation in history.
And yet the G20 still finds it extremely difficult to fulfill its objective, agreed in 2009, to “act together to generate strong, sustainable, and balanced global growth.”
Among the most notable obstacles has been the inability to compel some surplus economies to pursue growth-stimulating policies, which would compensate for the recessionary effects of adjustment in the deficit countries.
This failure is perhaps most pronounced within the eurozone, where Germany and the Netherlands have failed to reduce their surpluses, even as the deficit economies have undergone massive adjustments.
As a result, the eurozone has gone from having an overall deficit in 2008 to being a major surplus region – a shock that has subtracted about 1% from global demand.
Macroeconomic cooperation clearly must be made more effective.
But, as recent exchange-rate volatility has shown, even that will not be enough to stabilize the global economy. Monetary reform is also needed.
Such reform must include a reconsideration of the US dollar’s outsize role in shaping the international monetary system.
In an increasingly multipolar world, would it not be more appropriate to build a multicurrency system and make greater use of the only global currency that has ever been created: the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)?
Establishing the SDR as the leading global reserve currency would have far-reaching benefits.
It would allow all countries – not just major economic powers – to enjoy “seigniorage,” or the profits brought by money creation.
Moreover, as the IMF economist Jacques Polak suggested long ago, the IMF could finance its programs by creating SDRs, eliminating the cumbersome negotiations required to secure credits or raise member quotas.
And SDRs could support development; for example, they could be allocated in a larger proportion to developing countries, which have greater demand for foreign-exchange reserves.
China’s G20 leadership could be the impetus the group needs to initiate this shift.
Zhou Xiaochuan, Governor of the People’s Bank of China, was among the first to question the dollar’s role, some seven years ago, and China has been working steadily to internationalize the renminbi.
That effort reached a milestone in 2015, when the IMF Board agreed to add the renminbi to the basket of currencies that determines the SDR’s value.
Beyond the push to use SDRs more actively in IMF programs, governments could issue SDR-denominated bonds.
Moreover, private banks could increase their use of this monetary unit, just as some European banks used the so-called European Currency Unit, helping to pave the way for the euro.
The G20’s China summit represents an important opportunity to improve macroeconomic cooperation and launch major reforms of the global monetary system.
For the sake of balanced growth in developed and developing countries alike, it must not be squandered.
Inclusive Growth and Global Justice
ANKARA – As France and the world mourn the terrorist slaughter of innocents in Paris, the leaders of the G-20 are meeting in Antalya, Turkey.
Terror will now vault to the top of the long list of pressing issues that will be discussed.
The G-20, whose members account for about 85% of the world economy, has an important responsibility to respond to challenges that affect the lives and prosperity of millions of people around the world.
It cannot risk falling into complacency and inaction, whether regarding terrorism or the fragile state of the world’s economy.
Since Turkey assumed the presidency of the G-20 in December 2014, our approach toward ensuring inclusive and robust growth through collective action has enjoyed the support of the organization’s members.
This effort has been built on three pillars: decisive implementation of past commitments, boosting investments as a powerful driver of the global economy, and promotion of inclusiveness so that the benefits of growth are shared by all.
When it comes to implementation, great strides have been made.
By promoting sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies and implementing solid, structural reforms, we have made significant progress toward our objective of expanding the G-20’s collective GDP by 2.1% by 2018.
The global financial system is now more resilient than it has ever been.
Financial capacities are being rebuilt, and new growth targets are being met.
But there remains much more to be done.
G-20 members should expedite efforts to deliver on their commitments to boost productivity and eliminate structural bottlenecks to investment, competition, trade, and jobs.
We must also cement the fundamental reforms to the global financial system that the G-20 has delivered over the past seven years.
Our focus on investment – a key driver of growth, jobs, and development – is also beginning to pay off.
There is a huge investment gap in the global economy, both in advanced and developing countries.
That is why we need developed-country strategies that bring together concrete policy actions and commitments to improve the investment ecosystem, support small and-medium-size enterprises, and promote the construction of efficient, high-quality infrastructure.
If the G-20 members fully implement their commitments under these strategies, their collective GDP is expected to increase by another 1%.
Economic growth must be strong and sustainable; but, above all, it must be inclusive.
Inequality is rising in many G-20 countries; in some cases, it has reached historic highs.
This is a dangerous development, one that can retard growth, threaten the cohesion of societies, and jeopardize people’s wellbeing.
It is imperative that the G-20 tackle inequality head on and demonstrate its determination to ensure that all of its member countries’ citizens enjoy the fruits of economic growth.
Reducing unemployment is central to the fight against inequality.
There are about 100 million jobless people in the G-20, and another 200 million young people who are neither working nor studying.
Significantly reducing youth unemployment is one of the G-20’s most important commitments.
Inclusiveness cannot stop at the borders of the G-20.
We must work to ensure that the benefits of growth and prosperity are shared by people all over the world.
In Antalya, we will discuss how we can align our efforts with the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and increase our engagement with low-income, developing countries.
As politics and economics are increasingly intertwined, the G-20 must also work together to confront our era’s geopolitical challenges.
This year is an important one in the fight against climate change.
We must send a strong political message from Antalya in support of a successful outcome at the United Nations Climate Change Conference that takes place in Paris from November 30 to December 11.
Meanwhile, the terror attacks in Paris have brutally reminded us, once again, that global challenges – such as terrorism, the war in Syria, and the refugee crisis – require truly global responses.
The G-20 is an ideal forum in which to address them.
The Syrian civil war – now well into its fourth year – must be brought to an end, and a fair and sustainable political transition must be ensured.
The conflict and the brutal state terrorism of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime is not only the cause of terrible suffering in Syria and the death of more than 360,000 people; it is also the root of the refugee crisis and the emergence of Daesh – a threat to all countries.
Turkey is a member of the coalition against Daesh, and we are seeking to degrade and destroy this terrorist menace in our country and beyond our borders.
At the same time, we must not allow ourselves to forget the plight of those fleeing the brutality of the Assad regime and Daesh.
The international community that shuddered at the photograph of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian toddler who was found dead on a Turkish beach, must be made to remember that many more like him are dying every day in the cold waters of the Mediterranean and the Aegean.
Turkey is currently hosting some 2.2 million Syrian refugees, and we have spent more than $8 billion over the last three years caring for them.
The international community must agree on a mechanism that ensures that the burden is fairly shared.
Finally, it is important to note that Turkey continues to confront the threat of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), an organization listed as a terrorist group by both the United States and the European Union.
Turkey has implemented a large number of reforms and made major investments to the benefit of our Kurdish citizens.
And yet the PKK has refused to disarm, instead amassing weapons and attacking civilian and security targets across the country.
As we continue to fight the scourge of terrorism in our country, we call on all countries not only to mourn the dead in Paris, but to reject terrorism in all of its forms.
The G-20 Summit in Antalya will address these and other major issues confronting the world.
Whether the subject is economics, finance, climate change, or politics, the guiding principle must be equality and justice for all.
A Debt Agenda for the G7
CAMBRIDGE – On May 26-27, the heads of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries will gather in Japan to discuss common security and economic problems.
A major common problem that deserves their attention is the unsustainable increase in the major developed countries’ national debt.
Failure to address the explosion of government borrowing will have adverse effects on the global economy and on debt-burdened countries themselves.
The problem is bad and getting worse almost everywhere.
In the United States, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal government debt doubled over the past decade, from 36% of GDP to 74% of GDP.
It also predicts that, under favorable economic assumptions and with no new programs to increase spending or reduce revenue, the debt ratio ten years from now will be 86% of GDP.
Even more worrying, the annual deficit ratio will double in the next decade to 4.9% of GDP, putting the debt on track to exceed 100% of GDP.
The situation in Japan is worse, with gross debt at more than 200% of GDP.
Japan’s current annual deficit of 6% of GDP implies that the debt ratio will continue to rise rapidly unless action is taken.
Conditions differ among the eurozone countries.
But three of the European Union’s four largest economies – France, Italy, and the United Kingdom – all have large debts and annual deficits that point to even higher debt ratios in the future.
A rising level of national debt absorbs funds that would otherwise be available to finance productivity-enhancing business investment.
Businesses now fear that the increasing deficits will lead to higher taxes, further discouraging investment.
That is a worrying prospect for everyone.
When interest rates rise, as surely they must, the cost of servicing the debt will require higher taxes, hurting economic incentives and weakening economic activity.
And the persistence of large deficits reduces the room that governments have to increase spending when there is an economic downturn or a threat to national security.
Reducing deficits is obviously a task for those responsible for tax revenue and public spending: governments and legislatures.
But central banks also play a role, affecting the problem in two ways.
Low-interest-rate policies in advanced countries are depressing the current size of budget deficits, but at the cost of reducing pressure on political leaders to address future deficits and encouraging voters to favor more spending programs and larger tax cuts.
Central banks can help by announcing clearly that interest rates will rise substantially in the future, making it more expensive for governments to borrow and to roll over existing debt.
Reducing annual deficits requires either increased tax revenue or decreased outlays.
Raising marginal tax rates is both politically unpopular and economically damaging.
In the US, there is scope to raise revenue without increasing tax rates, by limiting so-called tax expenditures – the forms of spending that are built into the tax rules rather than appropriated annually by Congress.
For example, an American who buys an electric car receives a $7,000 tax reduction.
Larger tax expenditures in the US include the deduction for mortgage interest and the exclusion from taxable income of employer-paid health-insurance premiums.
Although eliminating any of these major tax expenditures might be politically impossible, limiting the amount by which a taxpayer could reduce his or her tax liability by using these provisions could raise substantial revenue.
So I do my best to persuade my Republican friends in Congress that reducing the revenue loss from tax expenditures is really a way to cut government spending even though the deficit reduction appears on the revenue side of the budget.
The good news is that a relatively small reduction in annual deficits can put an economy on a path to a much lower debt-to-GDP ratio. For the US, cutting the deficit from the projected 4.9% of GDP to 3% of GDP would cause the debt ratio to drop toward 60%.
The same is true elsewhere.
The long-run debt-to-GDP ratio is equal to the ratio of the annual budget deficit to the annual rate of growth of nominal GDP.
With 4% nominal GDP growth, a budget deficit of 2% would bring the long-term debt ratio down to 50%.
That should be the goal for which all of the G7 countries aim.
The Cost of Child Marriage
NEW YORK – The human costs of child marriage are well known; around the world, child brides are, on average, less educated, poorer, and more prone to sexual violence than women who marry later in life.
But when the economic impact of child marriage is added to this grim tally, the bill is truly staggering.
According to the International Center for Research on Women and the World Bank, ending the practice of child marriage would save billions of dollars in annual welfare expenditures, resulting in global savings of more than $4 trillion by 2030.
Simply put, the world cannot afford to allow child marriage to continue.
Many governments have already recognized this.
In Indonesia, for example, where the economic impact of child marriage is negatively affecting long-term growth forecasts, President Joko Widodo has vowed to outlaw the practice, a significant pledge in a country where 14% of girls are married before their 18th birthday.
But in most countries where child marriage is prevalent, change is not occurring fast enough.
While strategies have been discussed from Bangladesh to Zambia, funding for programs proven to reduce rates of child marriage – such as improving girls’ access to health care, education, and job training – remains inadequate.
If ending child marriage is ever to be more than a political talking point, holistic strategies must be backed by financial commitments.
To be sure, the child-marriage challenge is immense.
Today, roughly one in five girls worldwide is married or in an informal union before they turn 18, and most of these girls will become mothers before they reach adulthood.
In Niger, which has the world’s highest rate of child marriage, 76% of girls are married before they can vote.
And wherever child marriage occurs, girls often have little say in the decision.
The good news is that there has never been a better time to tackle this global problem.
With the economic costs of child marriage now clear, governments in the developing world are beginning to address the issue with more urgency.
To tip the scales, however, rich countries must be enlisted in the fight, and the next opportunity for them to engage is fast approaching.
On May 31, G7 finance and development ministers will hold the first of a series of meetings in Canada to discuss how economic growth can be more equitably shared.
These meetings will pave the way for broader discussions next week, when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hosts the full G7 summit.
Trudeau has already vowed to make gender equality a key theme at this year’s meeting, and we certainly welcome his focus.
But we also recognize that unless G7 ministers match their words with dedicated funding, the summit’s lofty pledges will fall short – and children everywhere will continue to suffer the injustice of early marriage.
Ending child marriage will require ambition, creativity, and money.
But that is just a start; targeted solutions are essential.
While education is critical to girls’ futures, simply building schools and paying teachers will not be enough.
To be fully empowered, girls need access to safe, quality education that gives them the confidence and skills to succeed.
Achieving that will require long-term engagement.
If the world’s richest countries were to make this issue a high priority, the payoffs would be significant.
For example, the World Bank estimates that if Niger could ban child marriage, it would realize annual welfare savings in the vicinity of $1.7 billion.
Bangladesh could generate an additional $4.8 billion in annual earnings and productivity, and welfare savings in Nigeria would total $7.6 billion.
Governments are starting to make strides in reducing rates of child marriage; in fact, the number of girls married as children each year is declining.
Unfortunately, change is happening too slowly.
If the world does not dramatically accelerate progress and scale up investments, rapid population growth will reverse current gains, and the number of child brides will grow once more.
Girls can change the world, but at the moment, circumstances beyond their control are limiting their potential.
When G7 ministers meet this week and next, one theme they will discuss is “investing in growth that works for everyone.”
From our perspective, the best way to translate that goal into reality is by addressing a social ill that generates huge costs – and not just for girls.
The G-7’s Sustainability Mission
FRANKFURT – In six months, representatives from countries around the world will gather in Paris in an effort to reach a global accord to fight climate change.
When the G-7’s leaders meet next week in Germany, they should use the occasion to take the first steps toward avoiding the most dangerous consequences of global warming.
With the world’s safety and prosperity at stake, the question is not whether or when to begin the transition to a low-carbon economy, but how to manage the effort.
In 2014, investments in clean energy reached a new high of $310 billion, after two years of decline.
That is good news, but it is still far short of the $1.1 trillion per year that the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates is needed in the low-carbon energy sector.
In the meantime, some $950 billion was invested in oil, gas, and coal in 2013 – a figure that has doubled in real terms since 2000.
The value of an investment is based largely on the perception of how risky it is.
Investment will not shift decisively toward greener sources of energy unless and until portfolio managers begin to account for the risks of dangerous climate change.
Investors also need to consider “carbon bubbles,” the overvaluation of fossil-fuel companies based on the assumption that they will be able to continue burning the world’s reserves until depletion.
Until recently, traditional forms of energy production have had the advantage of being based on established and mature industries.
But the tides are shifting.
Sovereign wealth funds and institutional and private investors are increasingly recognizing that climate change will undermine their returns, and that governments eventually will begin to address the problem.
Likewise, the Bank of England is undertaking important work on the risk that assets like coal or oil reserves could be “stranded” by policy changes intended to limit dangerous climate change.
And the G-20 finance ministers recently requested that the Financial Stability Board undertake a broad assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities.
The G-7 countries should clearly signal that they are serious about the low-carbon transition, and the most effective way to do that would be to support a global goal of cutting net greenhouse-gas emissions to zero by 2050.
In addition, governments and regulators can take concrete steps to stimulate private-sector investment in cleaner forms of energy.
For starters, governments should take the equivalent of the Hippocratic oath and pledge to do no active harm to the planet.
The New Climate Economy Report, released by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, on which I serve, underlines the importance of phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies and questions the wisdom of allowing export credit agencies to finance coal projects.
Governments must set themselves a firm four-year deadline to end fossil-fuel subsidies and redirect funding to areas like green infrastructure projects and development assistance.
Second, governments must lead by example.
High-level meetings in Addis Ababa and Paris later this year offer the opportunity to create synergies between the fight against climate change and financing for development and infrastructure.
Governments should also encourage public pension funds to invest responsibly, especially when it comes to the climate.
More, too, could be done to support the market for green bonds, including by issuing green government bonds.
Third, governments must create policy frameworks that foster low-carbon investments.
Putting a price on carbon is critical.
The slow but steady progress that countries are making toward this goal is encouraging.
In the meantime, governments should use a shadow carbon price and carbon discount rate in their decision-making processes.
In addition, governments and regulators should adopt policies ensuring sustainable financial-sector practices, including annual reporting by companies and investors on environmental, social, and governance issues and due diligence and risk models regarding environmental hazards.
Consideration of the possibility of stranded assets must be systematically expanded.
Finally, policymakers should foster partnerships and new instruments that nudge the economy toward low-carbon alternatives.
Development banks, for example, can help leverage private-sector investment.
And new institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank are in a position to make sustainability a core mandate.
Managing the transition from an economy based on fossil fuels to one based on low-carbon alternatives will not be easy.
But that is why it is essential to begin today.
It is time for the G-7 to recognize its responsibility and lead the world toward a sustainable future.
G-8 Summit and Climate Change
Two years ago, the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland promised to advance a clean development agenda and mobilize financial support for greener growth in the key emerging market economies.
This year’s meeting, in Heiligendamm, Germany, must deliver on that promise.
Since Gleneagles, a critical mass of public support to act decisively on climate change has developed.
Some say a tipping point has occurred.
The science and the economics of climate change has come closer as a result of the overwhelming scientific evidence in the studies of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Sir Nicholas Stern’s Report for the UK government on the costs of action and inaction.
Around the world expert officials, the business community, concerned citizens, and responsive governments are coming together to find common solutions to a global problem that may be the single most important issue we face as a global community.
In Heiligendamm, the G-8 leaders, together with representatives of major emerging economies (Brazil, Mexico, China, India, and South Africa, who have a critical stake in energy consumption to continue to generate economic growth), will discuss a comprehensive approach encompassing a set of energy options, from energy efficiency and renewable energy, to clean coal, carbon capture and storage, and carbon sequestration.
They also have a chance to advance the use of market mechanisms to do two things: mitigate climate change, and, at the same time, create incentives for expanded use of clean energy.
An important way to achieve both objectives is by expanding carbon markets.
Carbon finance is an effective vehicle for channeling funds for climate-friendly investments, including to the developing world.
Last year alone the size of the world carbon market tripled to over $30 billion, of which about 20 percent went to projects in the developing world.
By one estimate, with a long term, predictable, and equitable post-2012 global regulatory framework for curbing greenhouse gas emissions (when the Kyoto protocol expires), carbon markets could develop exponentially and deliver financial flows to developing countries of anywhere between $20 and $120 billion dollars/year.
The funds are sorely needed.
The World Bank calculations show that developing countries need an annual investment of about $165 billion through 2030 just to supply electricity to their people.
Of this sum, only about half is readily identifiable.
On top of this $80 billion gap, developing countries will need another $30 billion per year to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector alone and get on a low-carbon development path, and $10-40 billion dollars more per year to adapt to the already inevitable impact of climate change .
A G8 commitment to the global carbon market will foster long-term financing beyond 2012.
Such carbon finance can also tackle deforestation, which represents about 20% of the global CO2 emissions causing climate change.
A forest carbon facility can reward forest conservation as a means of protecting the climate while also preserving ecosystems and generating income for poor communities in developing countries.
The World Bank is keen to work with partners to experiment with such a facility for avoided deforestation.
An expanded carbon market can help pay for a transformation to a low carbon economy, but it won’t be enough.
Like other new markets, it will take time to mature and reach out to places with weaker market institutions.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said that rich countries need to take the lead because only then will the less developed economies follow, and she is right.
The United Kingdom recently announced a new £800 million Environmental Transformation Fund International Window.
Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his country is ready to look into the possibility of creating a new financial mechanism, with substantial funds for the relatively long- term, to help developing countries halt global warming.
These are the types of climate change leadership that the world needs.
Mobilizing large scale financing for clean investments today and over the next 5-10 years is critical because this is when developing countries will essentially “lock-in” carbon emissions for the next 50 years.
If we can help them get on a low carbon path, we will have taken a giant step forward in preserving and protecting our planet while enabling them to reduce poverty and offer their citizens a better future.
The meeting in Heiligendamm can advance the commitments made at Gleneagles two years ago and bring the world closer to a more sustainable future.
Gambler’s Ruin
San Francisco – From Adam Smith (1776) until 1950 or so, capital was considered by economists to be absolutely essential for economic growth.
You also needed a few good basic institutions. “Security of property and tolerable administration of justice,” as Smith put it.
If these fundamental institutions were right, then landlords, merchants, and manufacturers would invest and improve.
In investing and improving, they would add to the capital stock: “In all countries where there is a tolerable security [of property], every man of common understanding will endeavor to employ whatever [capital] stock he can command, in procuring either present enjoyment or future profit... A man must be perfectly crazy, who, where there is a tolerable security, does not employ all the stock which he commands, whether it be his own, or borrowed of other people...”
A larger capital stock would mean thicker markets, a finer division of labor, and a more productive economy.
A highly productive society based on a sophisticated division of labor was how you secured “the wealth of nations.”
Reverse the process, however, and you get the poverty of nations, which Smith believed he saw in the Asia of his time.
For Smith and his successors over the first 175 years, any episode of sustained economic growth overwhelmingly required investment capital.
We economists were by and large capital boosters, and our magic formula for economic development was saving, investment, thrift, and wealth accumulation.
The last and fullest expression of this line of thought comes at the end of the 1950’s with W.W. Rostow’s book The Stages of Economic Growth .
Then Robert Solow and Moses Abramovitz challenged this near-consensus.
They calculated that 75% to 80% of economic growth did not come from increasing the capital-output ratio – at least not if the private marginal product of capital was taken as an indicator of the social marginal product.
Instead, the keys to growth and development appeared to lie beyond an increase in capital intensity as measured by capital-output ratios: skills, education, technology broadly understood, and improvements in organizational management.
Yet capital continued to be seen as necessary, if not sufficient.
In the framework developed by the development economist Dani Rodrik, a shortage of capital can be a binding “growth constraint”: the place where “the biggest bang for the [policy] reform buck can be obtained.”
And even when other factors constrain growth more, they cannot be changed without changing the shape and form of the economy’s capital stock.
Indeed, high investment serves as a sign that other binding constraints to growth are absent, implying prosperity and that things are going right.
The problem is that for poor economies, raising the capital needed to relax binding growth constraints is difficult.
That’s why the world took the neo-liberal bet in the 1990’s: international capital mobility would come to the rescue by relaxing capital constraints where they were binding, and by reducing the scope for corruption and rent-seeking, which was often a more significant binding growth constraint.
The hope was that, like the pre-1913 era of British overseas investment, which financed a huge amount of industrialization in the resource-rich, temperate periphery of the world economy, net capital outflows from the industrial core would finance much late twentieth and twenty-first century industrialization.
But we all know the outcome: while international capital flows soared, the large net flow of capital from rich to poor countries simply never materialized.
In fact, the principal outcome was an enormous flow of capital from the periphery to the rich core.
For most of the past generation, and looking into the future, the message of the market is that the benefits of international capital mobility do not include a relaxation of the capital constraint, and thus an acceleration of growth in the global periphery.
The reason is not that the periphery offers an attractive labor force from which capital profits, but rather that the core – especially the United States – offers a form of protection for capital against unanticipated political disturbances.
But even though net international capital flows are going the wrong way, there are still substantial gross capital flows outward from the world economy’s core to its periphery.
And we can hope that these capital flows will carry with them the institutions and managerial expertise that have made the core so wealthy.
Nevertheless, a dispassionate observer might point out that for someone with limited resources and opportunities for policy reform to keep betting double-or-nothing on neo-liberalism is a strategy that has a well-deserved name: “Gambler’s Ruin.”
Gaming US Fiscal Reform
NEWPORT BEACH – It sounded like a really clever idea: Use a very public and sizeable threat to get bickering politicians to collaborate and compromise.
Well, it has not worked so far, and the already-sizeable stakes just got bigger.
No, I am not talking here about Europe’s debt crisis, decisive resolution of which still requires greater cooperation and shared responsibility, both within individual eurozone member states and between creditor and debtor countries.
I am referring to the complex fiscal situation in the United States – a fluid problem that has just been rendered more consequential by the recent warning from the ratings agency Moody’s that the US could lose its top credit rating next year if Congress fails to make progress on medium-term fiscal reforms.
Hobbled by the self-inflicted wounds of the debt-ceiling debacle in the summer of 2011 – which undermined economic growth and job creation, and further damaged Americans’ confidence in their political system – the US Congress and President Barack Obama’s administration recognized the need for a measured and rational approach to fiscal reform.
To increase the likelihood of this, they agreed on immediate spending cuts and tax increases that would automatically kick in (the “fiscal cliff”) if agreement on a comprehensive set of fiscal reforms eluded them.
On paper, at least, this sizeable threat – involving blunt fiscal contraction amounting to some 4% of GDP – should have properly aligned incentives in Washington, DC.
After all, no politician would wish to go down in history as being responsible for pushing the country back into recession at a time when unemployment is already too high, income and wealth inequalities are increasing, and a record number of Americans live in relative poverty.
Yet, so far, the threat has not worked.
To understand why, we can appeal to game theory, which provides economists and others a powerful framework with which to explain the dynamics of both simple and complex interactions.
The objective of threatening a fiscal cliff was to force a “cooperative outcome” on an increasingly “non-cooperative game.”
But, in the absence of a credible enforcer (and lacking sufficient mutual assurances), participants felt that they had more to gain from continuing their non-cooperative behavior.
Politicians on both sides of America’s political divide have generally felt that compromise would be viewed as a sign of weakness.
Moreover, too many have made prior commitments – for example, promising never to increase taxes – that they find hard to break, especially ahead of elections that both sides deem to be of defining significance for the country’s future, reflected in the candidates’ campaigns, which are getting nastier by the day.
The cost-benefit calculations will likely evolve after the election in November.
At that point, the cost of being singled out as collaborating with members of the other side – and thus the risk of being unseated by more extreme forces in one’s party – may well decline.
Moreover, since early September, the potential benefits of cooperation now include avoiding an embarrassing credit-rating downgrade next year if medium-term fiscal reform does not materialize.
I suspect that some will be quick to dismiss the consequences of a Moody’s downgrade.
And it certainly is tempting to do so.
After all, the global financial crisis badly damaged the credibility of ratings agencies as a whole.
Moreover, one would be hard pressed to identify any meaningful hit to the US from the decision by another major agency, Standard & Poor’s, to downgrade America’s sovereign rating in August 2011.
On the contrary, rather than spiking higher following S&P’s unprecedented move, US market interest rates continued to fall, reaching record-low levels.
This seemingly contradictory fall in financing costs reflected an abundance of foreign capital seeking to invest in the US, including money fleeing from Europe.
The absence of any adverse impact on government finances may thus lead some to dismiss the impact of a potential Moody’s downgrade in 2013.
Yet, those of us who are exposed on a daily basis to the inner workings of financial markets would caution against too upbeat an attitude toward a second downgrade by a major ratings agency.
Moreover, the potential impact certainly is not linear.
Owing to the way that investment contracts are written and guidelines specified, there is a meaningful difference between a single and multiple rating downgrades.
Were Moody’s to follow S&P in stripping the US of its triple-A rating, the most likely outcome is that the universe of global investors who are both able and willing to increase their holdings of US government securities would shrink over time.
Fortunately for the US, the immediate adverse impact on borrowing costs would be alleviated, if not nullified, by investors’ lack of readily available alternatives to US government bonds, as well as a Federal Reserve that has been buying large volumes of US Treasuries.
But this is not a long-term risk worth taking.
Historically, it has taken countries many years of difficult fiscal-policy efforts to regain a triple-A status.
And, while no one can be certain about where the limits lie, there are both theoretical and operational bounds to how many government bonds can (and should) be placed on the balance sheet of a modern, well-functioning central bank.
All of this suggests that, whether in the lame-duck congressional session following the elections or in the first few months of the new Congress, US politicians will likely dismantle the fiscal cliff.
Based on an assessment of potential commonality among the political parties, such a compromise would limit the contractionary fiscal impact to some 1.5% of GDP.
Such a mini-bargain would go a long way toward reducing the risk of a serious US recession.
But it would fall short of the type of fiscal reforms that would satisfy Moody’s.
Such reforms require a grand bargain between America’s political parties, which in turn presupposes visionary leadership by both of them.
The Emancipation Gap in Arab Education
PARIS – Discussion of education in the Arab world has focused only rarely on the role of schooling in changing social and political mores.
This is unfortunate, because educated citizens of Arab countries tend to be much less emancipated politically and socially, on average, than their peers in other parts of the world.
If Arab societies are ever to become more open and economically dynamic, their education systems will have to embrace and promote values appropriate to that goal.
The gap is reflected in the World Value Survey (WVS), a global opinion poll that allows for the comparison of a broad range of values in different countries.
Recently, the WVS surveyed 12 Arab countries – Jordan, Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Iraq, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Qatar, Yemen, Kuwait, and Libya – along with 47 non-Arab countries.
The results allow us for the first time to compare the residents of a sizable share of the Arab world to citizens elsewhere.
The WVS measures four revealing political and social values: support for democracy, readiness for civic engagement, obedience to authority, and support for patriarchal values that underpin discrimination against women.
As a typical country becomes richer, more educated, and more politically open, support for democracy and readiness for civic engagement rise, and obedience to authority and support for patriarchal values fall.
The data, however, reveal that Arab countries lag behind countries at similar levels of development.
Arabs have a lower preference for democracy (with a gap of 11%), are less civically active (a gap of 8%), respect authority more (by 11%), and embrace patriarchal values much more strongly (by a whopping 30%).
Two characteristics of the Arab world could explain this: its predominantly Muslim population and the autocratic governments that have ruled much of the region for the past 50 years.
According to the WVS, religiosity does indeed promote conservatism, but not more so in Arab countries than in the rest of the world.
Still, given that Arabs’ religiosity score is about double that of people elsewhere, this factor does partly explain the region’s conservatism.
But what is more interesting is the role that education plays – or does not play – in promoting social and political openness in the Arab world.
The biggest differences between Arab countries and the rest of the world can be found among the educated.
Consider preference for democracy.
On that measure, the gap between Arabs and non-Arabs with a university degree is 14%, while the gap between those with secondary degrees is only 5%.
And similar effects can be seen for the other three values.
Education, it seems, has a weaker effect on social values in Arab countries than elsewhere – by a factor of about three.
Thus, those seeking to foster openness in the Arab world should focus not on the impact of Islam, but on the education to which the region’s residents are exposed.
Indeed, one likely explanation of the observed gap in social values is that education is being deliberately used as a tool of indoctrination, with the purpose of consolidating autocratic governments.
Indeed, with the introduction of mass education in the 1960s, education in the Arab world was placed in the service of top-down nationalist projects.
Then, in the 1970s, after state-led modernization pushes had failed and governments had become increasingly repressive, education policies were infused with conservative, religious values – first in order to fight leftist opposition groups, and later to compete with Islamic groups on their own terrain.
A review of the pedagogical literature on the region’s education systems reveals the extent to which they have been designed for indoctrination.
Most of them are characterized by rote learning, disregard for analytical capabilities, an exaggerated focus on religious subjects and values, the discouragement of self-expression in favor of conformism, and students’ lack of involvement in community affairs.
These features are all geared to promote obedience and discourage the questioning of authority.
It may seem paradoxical that secular regimes were responsible for Islamicizing education.
But it makes sense if it is recognized as an attempt to exploit local cultural characteristics to reinforce the indoctrination effort (as has been done in China).
Blaming local culture, which societies largely inherit, is not constructive.
Recognizing that autocratic regimes purposefully neutralize the modernizing potential of education for the sake of their survival offers a road forward.
Unfortunately for the Arab world, it is a rather narrow road.
Elites will not willingly reform education if doing so puts their survival at risk.
Civil-society activists will need to fight to change the values underpinning their education systems, by encouraging civic engagement, inculcating democratic principles, supporting gender equality, and promoting diversity and pluralism.
Only by ensuring that these values take root in every school will they grow strong enough to change the course of Arab societies.
A Responsibility to Protect Iraqis?
CANBERRA – Only one possible justification – moral, political, or military – exists for renewed Western or other external military intervention in Iraq: meeting the international responsibility to protect victims, or potential victims, of mass atrocity crimes – genocide, ethnic cleansing, other crimes against humanity, or major war crimes.
Shia and other non-Sunnis in the path of the marauding ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) – a group whose ideology and behavior are too extreme even for Al Qaeda to stomach – have plenty of reason to fear such atrocities.
Ugly executions of military and other captives have undoubtedly occurred in Mosul, Tikrit, and other cities seized by ISIS.
But, based on the evidence currently available, it would be premature to conclude that violence against the defenseless has already occurred – or is imminent – on the scale necessary to justify outside military intervention.
Though pundits have been wrong about almost everything so far in this round of violence, the best current assessment of the overall military situation is that the acute phase of the crisis is past.
The mobilization of Shia militias means that the nightmare scenario, the fall of Baghdad, is unlikely, despite the virtual collapse of the Iraqi army.
According to this view, a protracted civil war can be expected, with the most probable long-term outcome being a permanent partition along ethno-sectarian fault lines.
In this scenario, the Kurds would control the north, the Sunnis would rule in the west and center, and the Shia would hold power in Baghdad and the south.
It is difficult to make a case for military intervention to prop up the current government and try to enable it to re-establish authority over the entire country.
Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, has been brutal, corrupt, and outrageously sectarian – deeply embarrassing his supporters in the United States and sometimes even his patrons in Iran.
Taking his side in an inter-communal civil war, even if it aided the much-needed US rapprochement with Iran, would simply add fuel to the Middle East cauldron.
Things might be different if al-Maliki could be persuaded to step down in favor of a broad-based Shia-Sunni-Kurdish administration, determined to govern inclusively and create an effective, non-political national army.
Massive diplomatic effort certainly should be mobilized to achieve this goal.
But this project has failed in the past, and the domestic leadership needed to ensure its success is nowhere to be seen.
Even if such an optimal political outcome were achieved, it is difficult to see what value could be added by external military intervention intended to destroy ISIS as a militant Sunni force.
Maybe the limited advisory and technical support now on offer from the US would be of some use.
But, beyond that, air strikes require targets – elusive when no armies are on the move – and all too often they produce innocent civilian casualties.
And even 150,000 pairs of foreign boots on the ground were insufficient to stabilize the country after the horribly ill-judged US-led military intervention in 2003.
None of this means that an external military option should be ruled out in the event of mass atrocity crimes occurring – or being imminently feared – at the hands of ISIS or anyone else.
In 2005, 150 heads of state and government at the United Nations unanimously supported an international responsibility to protect (“R2P”) at-risk populations, which in extreme cases could take the form of Security Council-authorized military intervention, as happened in 2011 in response to the behavior of Muammar el-Qaddafi’s regime in Libya.
Disagreement about the use of that mandate to pursue regime change, rather than only protection of civilians, paralyzed the Security Council in the face of similar atrocities in Syria.
But international support for basic R2P principles remains strong, with the Council itself continuing to use “responsibility to protect” terminology in its resolutions and statements (26 times, at last count, since Libya).
It is not impossible to envisage a consensus re-emerging should a sufficiently horrifying new atrocity occur in Iraq.
Of course, no such intervention will, or should, be approved in practice unless it is seen as satisfying several moral or prudential criteria, which, though not yet adopted by the UN as formal benchmarks, have been the subject of much international debate and acceptance over the last decade.
Those criteria are that the atrocities occurring or feared are sufficiently serious to justify, prima facie, a military response; that the response has a primarily humanitarian motive; that no lesser response is likely to be effective in halting or averting the harm; that the proposed response is proportional to the threat; and that the intervention will actually be effective, doing more good than harm.
These criteria, particularly the last, will always be difficult to satisfy.
But, should an obvious case for action arise in Iraq, we should not be so consumed by the desire not to repeat the misguided intervention in 2003, that we fail – as we did in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and so often elsewhere – to respond as our common humanity demands.
The Right Iraqi Intervention
CANBERRA – US President Barack Obama deserves unconditional support for his decision to use military force to protect the persecuted Yezidi minority from threatened genocide by marauding Islamic State (IS) militants in northern Iraq.
The United States’ action is completely consistent with the principles of the international responsibility to protect (R2P) people at risk of mass-atrocity crimes, which was embraced unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly in 2005.
The US military intervention touches all of R2P’s bases of legality, legitimacy, and likely effectiveness in meeting its immediate objectives.
In contrast to the original military intervention in Iraq – which touched none of these bases – the current US action, though lacking Security Council authorization, is being taken at the request of the Iraqi government, so there is no question of a breach of international law.
And it would clearly seem to satisfy the moral or prudential criteria for the use of military force, which, though not yet formally adopted by the United Nations or anyone else, have been the subject of much international debate and acceptance over the last decade.
The criteria of legitimacy are that the atrocities occurring or feared are sufficiently serious to justify, prima facie, a military response; that the response has a primarily humanitarian motive; that no lesser response is likely to be effective in halting or averting the harm; that the proposed response is proportional to the threat; and that the intervention will do more good than harm.
The available evidence is that the many thousands of men, women, and children who have sought refuge in the Sinjar mountain range of northern Iraq are indeed at risk.
They face death not only from starvation and exposure, but also from genocidal slaughter by the rapidly advancing IS forces, who regard the Yazidis as apostates and have already perpetrated atrocities unrivaled in their savagery.
The US motive in mobilizing air power to protect them is unquestionably humanitarian.
It is clear that no lesser measures will be sufficient, and the only question about proportionality that arises is whether the air strikes and supply drops will do too little, rather than too much, to address the emergency.
Unlike the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, it cannot be argued that external military intervention will be likely to cause more harm than good.
It should be at least as effective in protecting the Yezidis (and Kurds and others in nearby Erbil) as was the intervention in Libya in 2011 to stop the threatened massacre by Muammar el-Qaddafi’s forces of the people of Benghazi.
Whether it will contribute to reversing the major gains already made by IS forces in northern Iraq, and to re-establishing the territorial integrity of the Iraqi state, is a different question.
As the Obama administration has made clear, that will depend, above all, on whether the disastrously divisive leadership of Nouri al-Maliki, Iraq’s Shia prime minister, gives way to a more inclusive regime, and whether, in that context, the ineffectual Iraqi army can regroup and rally.
Though some conservative American voices are already calling for more to be done, no compelling case can be made in the US, Europe, or my own country for sacrificing further blood and treasure in an effort to prop up a regime so demonstrably unable and unwilling to help itself hold the country together.
As I have argued previously, the only possible justification – moral, political, or military – for renewed external military intervention in Iraq is to meet the international responsibility to protect victims, or potential victims, of mass atrocities.
It is a little frustrating to those of us who have worked to embed R2P principles in international policy and practice that US leaders remain reluctant to use that terminology – a reluctance that partly reflects the perceived domestic political risk in relying on anything that comes from the UN.
But it would be churlish to complain when, as here, Obama talks of “upholding international norms,” and in practice moves to do exactly what the R2P norm requires.
There are also, of course, American voices – like that of the foreign-policy realist Stephen Walt – arguing for less to be done, on the ground that US interests are insufficiently engaged to justify any military intervention, however limited.
But this is to adopt a narrowly traditional view of the national interest – focusing only on direct security and economic advantage – and to ignore a third dimension, reputational advantage, which increasingly determines the extent to which countries respect and relate to one another.
It is in every country’s national interest to be – and to be seen as – a good international citizen.
There can be no better demonstration of good international citizenship than a country’s willingness to act when it has the capacity to prevent or avert a mass atrocity crime.
Obama has recently been criticized, in the context of his attitude toward the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, as being “cerebral in part of the world that’s looking for the visceral.”
His response to the plight of the Yezidis in Iraq has been both cerebral and visceral, and both America and the world are better for it.
Sorry is the Hardest Word
CANBERRA – Apologies, or the lack of them, have been back in the news, raising questions again about how useful they are in resolving international problems.
The efficacy of timely and sincere apologies in defusing personal tensions cannot be doubted.
Is the same true for diplomacy?
In some recent cases, the issue has been not much more than an irritating sideshow, as when Afghan President Hamid Karzai demanded an apology from the United States late last year for causing unintended civilian deaths – at the price, bizarrely, of allowing the Americans to continue defending him and his country (the US understandably refused).
But in other cases, the stakes have become very high indeed.
Bilateral relations between Indonesia and Australia since last November have become more frigid than they have been in decades, owing to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s very real anger at Australia’s refusal to offer an apology for tapping his private telephone (and his wife’s).
And Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit in December to the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan’s war dead – including, since 1978, its most serious convicted war criminals – has re-opened long-festering wounds among Japan’s neighbors, who perceive a lack of sincere contrition for waging aggressive war and committing wartime atrocities.
It has certainly added tension to Japan’s already-fraught standoff with China over their competing claims to the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea.
In the case of Indonesia’s reaction to former US intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden’s revelations of Australian spying on its first family, a personal apology from Prime Minister Tony Abbott would have made all the difference.
He had merely to follow the playbook of President Barack Obama’s response to German Chancellor Angela Merkel when the US was similarly caught out.
Had he coupled this with a simple promise to “review our collection processes and priorities,” there might even have been no need to pledge explicitly, as the US now has, to end all monitoring of “the leaders of our close friends and allies.”
I was in Jakarta at the time, and formed that judgment after speaking to very senior officials, and I advised the Australian government accordingly.
But the government took the view that when it comes to intelligence matters, apologies are for wimps.
With elections looming in Indonesia, and nationalist sentiment there strong, Australia will be paying the diplomatic price for a long time unless it changes course.
The case of Japan is more complex.
Under strong international pressure in the 1980’s and 1990’s – to which I hope I contributed as Australia’s foreign minister – a series of powerful apologies were in fact offered.
Notable among them was then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono’s statement in 1993 on the issue of Korea’s “comfort women,” and Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama’s expression, on the 50th anniversary of the end of the World War II, of “deep remorse” and “heartfelt apology.”
There has been no subsequent outright disavowal of these apologies; indeed, this month Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said that Abe’s cabinet members “have never denied” the Kono and Murayama statements.
But, save for a gracious acceptance by South Korea’s then-President Kim Dae-jung in 1998, Japan’s apologies simply have not resonated much in the region, because they have regularly been accompanied by apparent side-stepping or backsliding.
Japan’s Diet, for example, failed to endorse Murayama’s statement in 1995, agreeing only to express “a deep feeling of remorse” (and even then 241 MPs abstained).
Above all, there have been Japanese leaders’ recurring pilgrimages to Yasukuni.
The shrine not only records war criminals in its “Book of Souls”; it also contains the Yushukan museum, where Japan’s conquests in the 1930’s and 1940’s are glorified as “just wars fought for survival and self-defense” or for the “liberation of Asia.”
Certainly some of the outraged reaction by Japan’s neighbors is of questionable sincerity.
South Koreans have often failed to acknowledge the number and intensity of statements about comfort women (who were forced to provide sexual services to Japanese soldiers) and the amount of compensation on offer.
China, for its part, periodically mobilizes nationalist sentiment to divert attention from internal problems, and partly encouraged Abe’s recent assertiveness by declaring an Air Defense Identification Zone beyond its acknowledged national airspace in the East China Sea – a move that, while not illegal, was certainly provocative.
But Japan could and should have done much more to give real substance to its apologies, as the Germans have done.
At least since 1970, Germany has taken a comprehensive and credible approach to atoning for its Nazi past, fully acknowledging its horrors in school curricula, graphically commemorating them in museums, monuments, and ceremonies, and employing official discourse that has been unfailingly contrite.
Harvard’s Ezra Vogel, while not sparing China from his prescriptions, recently mapped some strategies by which Japan could defuse historical issues.
Vogel recommends a full and objective official account of the suffering Japan’s military aggression caused, lengthening the time that students must devote to modern Japanese history, and including regional reactions and criticism in that study.
Diplomats can learn from examples of transformative national apologies.
The reconciliation of indigenous and white Australians was hugely advanced by Prime Minister Paul Keating’s Redfern speech in 1992, in which he declared: “We committed the murders.
We took the children from their mothers.
We practiced discrimination and exclusion.
It was our ignorance and our prejudice...” Likewise, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd offered a strong apology in 2008 to the “stolen generations” of Aboriginal children taken from their families by welfare officers.
There are many situations in which apologies are not necessary, because both sides agree to move on.
And “non-apology apologies” – for example, “I’m sorry if you feel I have offended you” – are often worse than nothing, although they are a familiar diplomatic stock-in-trade of which I, too, have been guilty of using.
It is also conceivable that genuine apologies may be counterproductive, because they trigger a backlash from local extremists, which may in turn fuel even more flames on the other side.
I would, however, resist the conclusion that Japan’s apologies have been a net negative in this respect.
These arguments will continue.
But it is difficult to believe that when a wrong has been done, a sincere apology will not have some restorative impact.
In public, as in private life, honest apologies are a powerful tool, and should be used less nervously and more often.
Cambodia’s Violent Peace
CANBERRA – Cambodia’s government has been getting away with murder.
Not the kind of genocidal slaughter conducted by the Khmer Rouge in the 1970’s. Nor the scale of killing that has been roiling Syria, or that has put Ukraine, Venezuela, Thailand, and Bangladesh in the global headlines of late.
But murder nonetheless, with Cambodian citizens deliberately targeted by their country’s security forces.
On January 3, five striking garment workers were shot dead in Phnom Penh while peacefully demanding a minimum livable wage.
Many others were severely injured by gunfire and beatings.
More than 20 have been detained without trial.
This followed deadly violence against unarmed demonstrators protesting last year’s deeply flawed national election, won, yet again, by Prime Minister Hun Sen’s ruling Cambodian People’s Party, which has dominated political life for more than three decades.
The recent killings repeat a pattern of political violence that has recurred all too often at crucial moments in Cambodia’s history – even after the 1991 Paris Peace Agreements, which were intended to bring not only peace, but also democracy and human-rights protection to the country’s long-suffering people.
No country in the world deserved all three more, ravaged as it was for two decades by massive United States bombing, civil war, a genocidal reign of terror by the Khmer Rouge, invasion by Vietnam, and more civil war – with some two million dead as a result.
Hopes were high that Cambodia had been set on a transformative path by the success of the United Nations peace plan, the huge peacekeeping operation that followed, and the remarkably peaceful election of 1993 (in all of which Australia played a leading role during my time as Foreign Minister).
In some respects, those hopes have been realized.
The Khmer Rouge did wither away, and with it the lingering threat of renewed civil war.
The Cambodian economy – strongly supported in recent years by aid and investment from China – has grown steadily (though it lags behind most of its regional neighbors, and concerns about corruption and political instability are preventing it from reaching its full potential).
But Cambodia’s record on democracy and human rights since the Paris Peace Agreements has not been a good one.
A grenade attack on an opposition rally led by Sam Rainsy in March 1997 killed 16 people and injured more than a hundred.
That July, after an uneasy period of sharing power with Prince Norodom Ranariddh’s royalist party, Hun Sen launched a bloody coup in which his opponents were exiled, arrested, tortured, and in some cases summarily executed.
Neither episode generated much international reaction: Hun Sen still had enough political capital from his fight against the Khmer Rouge and his cooperative role in the peace process, while Sam Rainsy was regarded as deeply flawed, and the royalist leadership as feckless.
Cambodia-fatigue among policymakers also played a role.
At the time, I wanted to believe that these reverses would be temporary, and there were too many like me.
Since then, while preserving a democratic façade, Hun Sen has ruled, for all practical purposes, as an autocrat, showing scant regard for rights of free expression and association – and resorting to violent repression whenever he has deemed it necessary to preserve his and his party’s position.
This has been accompanied by staggering levels of corruption, with Cambodia ranked 160th by Transparency International, out of 175 countries.
There are stories, unverifiable but plausible, that 20 or more of Hun Sen’s closest associates have each amassed more than $1 billion through misappropriation of state assets, illegal economic activity, and favoritism in state procurement and contracting.
There has also been political patronage bordering on parody, with one recent count putting the government’s size at 244 ministers and secretaries of state.
For far too long, Hun Sen and his colleagues have been getting away with violence, human-rights abuses, corruption, and media and electoral manipulation without serious internal or external challenge.
But things are beginning to change.
A credible new opposition party – the Cambodia National Rescue Party – has emerged under Sam Rainsy (who looks a little more like a national leader now than just a monochromatic anti-Vietnamese crusader), gaining significant popular support.
A large number of social-media-savvy young voters have been turning out in the streets demanding a change of government.
Internationally, too, some pressure has been building, but not enough.
Ed Royce, Chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, has called on Hun Sen to resign; condemnatory resolutions have been passed in a number of parliaments; and many states entered criticisms of one kind or another into the record when the UN Human Rights Council reviewed Cambodia’s human-rights record in Geneva a few weeks ago.
But the tone of too many of these statements has been muted.
Australia’s statements have been typical – falling over backward to avoid giving offense, and too anxious to balance criticism with praise.
Officials are “concerned” about “recent disproportionate violence against protesters” but “welcome the Government’s stated commitment to undertake electoral reforms.”
Australia’s new foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has talked, as foreign ministers often do, of the need to avoid unproductive “megaphone diplomacy” and to “engage, not enrage” her counterparts.
But, it seems that no robust critique was delivered when she met privately with Hun Sen in Phnom Penh on February 22 – even though Australia’s high standing in Cambodia (not least owing to its historical role in the peace process) means that its voice certainly would have been listened to.
There is a place for quiet diplomacy that relies on genuine engagement to encourage significant behavioral change.
But when states behave badly enough for long enough, loud megaphones can also be in order.
I know Hun Sen and worked well with him in the past.
I have resisted strong public criticism until now, because I thought there was hope for both him and his government.
But their behavior has now moved beyond the civilized pale.
It is time for Cambodia’s political leaders to be named, shamed, investigated, and sanctioned by the international community.
Abe’s Asian Gambit
CANBERRA – With the world producing more history than most of us can consume right now, it is easy to lose sight of recent developments that could have even greater consequences for long-term peace and stability than recent alarming events in eastern Ukraine, Gaza, and Syria-Iraq.
The outcome of the nuclear negotiations with Iran, the change of leadership in India and Indonesia – two of the world’s three largest democracies – and the re-energizing of the BRICS group of major non-Western states (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) may all be such game-changers.
But Japan’s international muscle-flexing under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may be even more significant.
Unless it is very carefully managed by all concerned, including the United States and Japan’s other closest Asia-Pacific allies, Abe’s makeover of Japanese foreign policy could undermine the fragile power balances that have so far kept the Sino-American rivalry in check.
Japan is right to be concerned about China’s new regional assertiveness, and Abe’s recent diplomatic push to strengthen Japan’s relations in Southeast Asia, and with Australia and India, is understandable in that context.
Nor is it inherently unreasonable – despite opposition at home and abroad – for his government to seek to reinterpret Article 9 of Japan’s “peace constitution” to permit wider engagement in collective self-defense operations and military cooperation with allies and partners.
But the risks in all of this must be openly acknowledged.
Opposition to any perceived revival of Japanese militarism is hard-wired in Northeast Asia.
Abe is an intensely conservative nationalist, still deeply reluctant to accept the extent of Japan’s World War II guilt (even when acknowledging, as he did in Australia recently, “the horrors of the past century’s history” and offering gracious condolences for “the many souls who lost their lives”).
His refusal to rule out future visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, with its war-glorifying Yushukan Museum alongside, fuels hardline skepticism in China.
It also makes common cause with South Korea much more difficult, and heightens the risk of maritime territorial disputes becoming explosive.
Less noticed, but possibly more important in the long term, have been Japan’s efforts to reshape regional security arrangements, which for many years have had three key elements.
First, there have been the hub-and-spoke alliances of the US with Japan, South Korea, and Australia (and more loosely with Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines).
These alliances are accepted and well understood, if not loved, by China.
Second, there are national defense efforts, encouraged by the US, increasingly aimed at greater self-reliance in the event that China’s rise becomes a military threat.
This, too, has been accepted reasonably calmly, if not always quietly, by China, and has not undermined the continuing growth in bilateral economic relationships that every country in the region is developing with China.
Finally, there have been multilateral security dialogues – the ASEAN Regional Forum and now the East Asia Summit the most prominent among them – designed to be vehicles for confidence building, and conflict prevention and management.
These mechanisms have so far promised more than they have delivered, though not for want of continuing efforts to give them more clout.
For all of the hype that has accompanied the US “pivot” to Asia – announced by President Barack Obama in the Australian Parliament in November 2011 – the delicate balances involved in this basic architecture have changed little for decades.
But now Japan, with overt support from Australia in particular, seems determined to change the balance by establishing, as a counterweight to China, a much denser alliance-type relationship with selected partners.
Abe spoke repeatedly in the Australian Parliament earlier this month of Japan’s new “special relationship” with Australia – terminology normally associated only with the strongest of alliance partnerships – and followed his address by signing an agreement for the transfer of defense equipment and technology.
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who earlier this year described Japan as both our “best friend in Asia” and a “strong ally,” has warmly embraced the “special relationship” language.
He consummated the love-in by expressing his admiration for “the skill and sense of honor” of the Japanese submariners who died attacking Sydney Harbor in 1942, while saying of Japan’s waging of aggressive war and wartime atrocities only that “we disagreed with what they did.”
We have not yet seen any renewed attempt to re-establish the “Quadrilateral Security Dialogue,” comprising Japan, Australia, the US, and India, which conducted joint military exercises in 2007 and was seen by China as a hostile containment enterprise.
But it is not hard to imagine that this is still very much on Abe’s wish list.
The dangers should not be exaggerated.
But, with strategic competition between the US and China as delicately poised as it is, and with the economic interests of Australia, Japan, and many others in the region bound up just as intensely with China as their security interests are with the US, rocking the boat carries serious risks.
Countries like ours should take a clear stand when China overreaches externally (as it has in the South China Sea with its indefensible “nine-dashed line” asserting historical rights with no known justification in international law).
The same applies when China does not behave like a good international citizen on the UN Security Council, or should it commit egregious human-rights violations at home.
But we should be cautious about moving beyond taking stands to taking sides in the region to a greater extent than has been the norm for decades.
Kishore Mahbubani has argued recently that we need to recognize that in China, as elsewhere, a significant internal contest between hard- and softer-liners is taking place.
To the extent that this is the case, it is smart policy for every state in the region to speak and act in a way that helps the doves and gives no encouragement to the hawks.
MH370’s Beacon of Hope
MELBOURNE – The harrowing mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on March 8 with 239 people aboard, may be at least partly resolved within a matter of days.
Underwater search vehicles are homing in on an area just a few kilometers wide in the vastness of the southern Indian Ocean, some 2,000 kilometers northwest of Perth.
This is where the Boeing 777-200 is likely to have run out of fuel and crashed, according to the analysis by the UK company Inmarsat and British aviation experts of hourly signals sent automatically from the aircraft to Inmarsat’s orbiting space vehicle.
More promising still, it is where signals, assumed to have come from the locator beacons attached to the aircraft’s “black box” flight recorders, were picked up on April 5 and over the following days by an American “pinger locator” being towed by an Australian navy vessel, the Ocean Shield.
The Australian defense authorities now coordinating the search still say that to discover wreckage probably lying 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles) deep, on so remote a seabed, will be like “finding a needle in a haystack.”
And any subsequent recovery operation will obviously still be a huge challenge.
But officials are confident that they have at least found the haystack.
During the early days of the search, almost everything that could go wrong did – from overlooked or misunderstood data to poor communication and uncoordinated and misallocated resources – as attention remained focused on the aircraft’s scheduled route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
And there were huge frustrations even when the search shifted to the Indian Ocean, as massive naval and air resources failed to find any trace of relevant surface debris.
But, whatever the past frustrations, and possibly even bigger disappointments yet to come, the bigger and much more significant story of the search for MH370 is what has gone right.
Simply put, it has been a magnificent demonstration of how response to human tragedy can unite rather than divide, reinforcing the impulse to cooperate rather than confront.
And it has testified to the good sense of those who have been arguing for years, in a variety of Asian and wider global contexts, that maritime search, rescue, and disaster relief is an ideal place to start in creating confidence building mechanisms aimed at laying the foundations for conflict prevention and resolution.
The search has involved unprecedented international cooperation, first in the South China Sea and then in the Indian Ocean, from a total of 26 countries.
What is extraordinary is that many of these countries (like China, Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea, and Vietnam) have been at one another’s throats over territorial and other disputes, while others (not least China and the US) are abidingly suspicious of each other’s geopolitical motives and intentions.
Australia’s close cooperation throughout the search with China – whose citizens comprised nearly two-thirds of those aboard the ill-fated flight, and whose naval and air resources have been unceasingly devoted to the common effort – has borne immediate fruit: a highly successful visit earlier this month by Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
An important trade deal advanced, and no issue was made of the new Abbott government’s embarrassingly fulsome embrace of US leadership in the region, and its rookie mistake in describing Japan as “our best friend in Asia” (the right formula in these cases being “We have no better friend than…”).
It’s a reach, but tempting, to suggest that Australia’s long-term security might even be better guaranteed by spending a few million dollars on towed pinger locators and unmanned Bluefin-21 mini-submarines, with their sonars and cameras, and some serious naval infrastructure to support them, rather than the $20-40 billion currently being contemplated to renew and extend Australia’s aging combat-submarine fleet.
It is not quite as naive as it may seem to think that the peace and security of the whole Indo-Pacific region, not to mention other equally volatile parts of the world, might be better advanced by devoting far more resources and effort to common security strategies rather than traditional military ones.
Finding security with others, rather than against them, and concentrating on cooperative approaches to achieving global and regional public goods, seems more productive than giving free rein to crude nationalist sentiment and planning ever more sophisticated and expensive ways to destroy one another.
The search for MH370 has shown in microcosm how much there is to be gained through peaceful cooperation.
It should also help focus our attention on just how much there is to be lost in today’s world – a world that is far more interdependent than the one that exploded in 1914 – if we fail to apply these lessons to our broader international relationships.
The world is a much safer and saner place when states search for and find common ground on which to work together.
Protecting Civilians Responsibly
BEIJING – Would China ever be willing to host an international policy discussion about the conditions that would legitimize invading another country to stop genocide or other mass-atrocity crimes from being committed within its borders?
Given China’s long history of antagonism to “interference in internal affairs” in general, and to “humanitarian intervention” in particular, and in view of its contribution to the UN Security Council’s long paralysis over much less coercive measures in Syria, you would be in good company if you answered, “No.”
But you would be wrong.
I have just been at a two-day meeting in Beijing that wrestled with just this topic.
The meeting, hosted by the foreign ministry’s think tank, the China Institute of International Studies, brought together specialist scholars and practitioners from China and the other BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa).
And this month, the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Diplomatic Academy will host a conference in Moscow, with local and international experts discussing the same subject.
Both meetings are, to my knowledge, the first of their kind.
The fact that they are happening at all – and, if my Beijing experience is any guide, in a constructive, problem-solving spirit – is an encouraging development.
Although no outcome was formally agreed or made public, several themes emerged from the Beijing meeting.
Taken together, they offer reason for confidence that it may be possible to recreate international consensus, so long missing in Syria, about how to deal with the hardest mass-atrocity cases.
First, there was widespread acceptance that the “Responsibility to Protect” (R2P) doctrine, unanimously agreed by the United Nations General Assembly in 2005, is here to stay.
R2P recognizes that sovereign states have a responsibility to protect their people from genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity, and war crimes; that other states have a responsibility to assist them to do so; and that if a state is “manifestly failing” to protect its people, the wider international community has a responsibility to step in with “timely and decisive action,” which might in an extreme case include military action if approved by the UN Security Council.
True, some Chinese scholars remain inclined to argue that the entire R2P enterprise – particularly its sanction of military action in exceptional cases– is just “old neo-interventionist wine in a new bottle.”
But this did not appear to be a majority sentiment, nor did it stop anyone from engaging in lively discussion of how the R2P doctrine could be most effectively implemented in practice.
Second, there was widespread agreement about what had caused the breakdown of consensus in the Security Council concerning how to respond to events in Syria (at least until the use of chemical weapons in August proved to be a game changer).
The cause was not an attempt by the global South to revive outdated notions of unlimited sovereignty; rather, it was a reaction to the perceived overreach of the NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011.
The Security Council’s three Western permanent members – France, the United Kingdom, and the United States (the P3) – had sought and been given a limited mandate to protect civilians, specifically invoking R2P.
But they were perceived as then ruthlessly pursuing full-scale regime change, without securing any further agreement from the Council.
If the P3 (now often privately, and rather more acerbically, described as FUKUS) were going to take a mile after being given an inch, then no more inches would be offered.
Third, and most important, there was widespread agreement about how consensus within the Security Council on the hardest cases might be recreated.
The idea was that R2P should be “enriched” by the acceptance of a complementary principle, called “Responsible Protection.”
Floated by the Chinese scholar Ruan Zongze in a journal article last year, and evidently the subject of much internal discussion since, Responsible Protection builds upon “Responsibility While Protecting,” an approach earlier proposed by Brazil that has already gained some traction at the UN.
The core elements of Responsible Protection, as articulated by Chinese participants in the Beijing debate, won strong support around the table.
Tough criteria – specifically, legitimate intention, last resort, proportionality, and balance of consequences – should be clearly satisfied before any military mandate is granted, with every effort made to exhaust diplomatic solutions before more robust alternatives are embraced.
There should be better methods of supervision and accountability to ensure that the “protection” objective remains at the heart of any response.
And the primary emphasis of the entire R2P enterprise should continue to be prevention of mass-atrocity crimes – both their occurrence and their recurrence.
Some in the P3 and elsewhere will see all of this as a mere spoiling operation with a more sophisticated face.
But they will do so at their peril.
The idea of Responsible Protection – like the Brazilian initiative that preceded it – reflects genuinely and widely felt concerns.
If not addressed, they will make Security Council resolutions in support of military action in R2P cases almost impossible to obtain in the future.
It remains to be seen whether China – and the other BRICS countries – will now move to champion the idea of Responsible Protection in a formal way.
If they do, it should not be viewed as a rearguard action designed to undermine the R2P norm, but rather an effort to assume co-ownership of it.
In terms of getting serious about saying “never again” to mass-atrocity crimes, that is about as positive a development as anyone could hope for.
Five Reasons Why the Sky Is Not Falling
BUDAPEST – When it comes to geopolitics, there is always a market for gloom.
Business has been booming in this respect lately, with The Economist, Foreign Affairs, and many less exalted journals full of claims that the global order is crumbling, America’s ability (and willingness) to save it is in terminal decline, and the prospect of avoiding major conflict in the decade ahead is illusory.
Plenty of recent events – along with the ghosts of 1914 and 1939 – have boosted the reputations, royalties, and revenues of today’s doomsayers.
There is Russia’s adventurism in Ukraine; China’s territorial assertiveness – and Japan’s new push-back nationalism – in East Asia; continuing catastrophe in Syria and disarray in the wider Middle East; the resurgence of atrocity crimes in South Sudan, Nigeria, and elsewhere in Africa; and anxiety about renewed communal strife in India after Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi’s stunning election victory.
But, though global political conditions are hardly as good as they could be – they never are – there are plenty of grounds for thinking that they are not nearly as bad as so many are claiming.
Here are the five most important reasons not to lose as much sleep as some pundits say you should.
First, Cold War II is not at hand.
Russia and China dislike the United States’ claim to global leadership, enjoy tweaking its tail whenever they can, want greater regional influence, and (like the US itself) periodically turn their back on cooperative multilateralism.
But they are deeply integrated into the existing global order, and have neither the ideological drive, economic interest, physical capacity, nor allied support to challenge it.
They want greater influence in international institutions, not to overturn them.
Second, the decline in US power and influence relative to China and other rising powers is natural, inevitable, and not a cause for alarm among those long reliant on America’s protection and support.
It is inconceivable that the US could have maintained forever the unipolar dominance of the early post-Cold War years, when it accounted for close to 30% of global GDP and half of the world’s military expenditure.
Others were bound to play catch-up.
The reality is that, in absolute terms, US economic and military power is still enormous, and that it has – and will have for the foreseeable future – far more allies, friends, and influence than any of its competitors.
What matters is how it now chooses to exercise that power.
As I heard Bill Clinton say privately, shortly after his presidency, that choice should not be “to try to stay top dog on the global block in perpetuity, but to create a world in which we are comfortable living when we are no longer top dog on the global block.”
Third, while rising powers’ ambition for more space and influence is a given, it is not remotely inevitable that this quest must take a military form.
Everyone has too much to lose.
The world’s major powers are far more interdependent financially and in terms of supply chains than they were in 1914 – the year of misguided optimism that pessimists love to cite – and the cumulative horrors of the twentieth century have fundamentally changed the normative environment.
Bellicisme – the notion that war is noble, and can be purifying and cleansing – is dead beyond redemption.
Fourth, the decline of reliance on military power to solve geopolitical problems is not a sign that wimps are in charge, but that adults are.
US credibility is not at risk, for either its allies or foes, when it makes carefully calibrated choices about the balance of risk and return in using such force in particular cases.
The recurring criticism directed at President Barack Obama for not following through on his threat to attack Syria if it used chemical weapons completely misses the point.
The object was to stop these weapons from being used by the Assad regime, and diplomacy – backed by the threat of force – appears to have achieved just that (although there have been recent reports, unconfirmed but worrying, of both rebel use and regime backsliding).
Of course military force needs to be kept in the toolbox, to respond to states that wage aggressive war, like Iraq in 1991.
Military capability is also needed to meet the global responsibility to protect citizens at risk of genocide and other mass-atrocity crimes if no lesser option is available and if intervening will do more good than harm, as would have been the case in Rwanda in 1994.
But if the cowboy days of George W. Bush are over, that is to be applauded, not lamented.
Fifth, the international system has been responding to geopolitical challenges more effectively than is generally acknowledged.
Despite the meltdown in their relationship over Crimea, the US and Russia have continued to work together to negotiate a diplomatic solution to the Iran nuclear issue, and (with China) develop collective Security Council responses to successive crises in Africa.
In almost every area of major power rivalry, potentially volatile issues are compartmentalized, while cooperation elsewhere continues.
No policymaker can be complacent.
There is no end in sight to the Syrian nightmare, the respite in eastern Ukraine may be proving temporary, and in Sino-Japanese relations cool heads remain in short supply.
Nor is there any shortage of other issues and systemic improvements, not least nuclear-arms reduction, on which to work.
But alarmist pessimism is self-reinforcing, defeatist, and needs to be contested.
There is plenty of reason to believe that, where it matters most, we have learned enormously from the mistakes of the past.
If we can stay calm and levelheaded, the worst of them will not be repeated.
Mandela for the Ages
MELBOURNE – Without Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s apartheid nightmare eventually would have come to an end.
Its enforcers were beyond the civilized pale, and the world’s patience with them had run out.
But, without Mandela’s towering moral and political leadership, the transition would have been long, ugly, and bloody beyond measure.
One Afrikaner leader, F.W. De Klerk, came to understand – late, but not too late – what the times demanded, and he thoroughly deserved to share the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela.
But it was Madiba – the tribal name by which South Africans of every caste and color now affectionately call him – who made the crucial difference.
I was lucky enough, as Australia’s foreign minister at the time, to be one of the first foreign officials to greet him after his release from prison in February 1990 – just a few days later, in Lusaka, where he had flown to meet his African National Congress colleagues in exile.
Approaching the meeting, I was excited but nervous.
Could the reality of the man possibly match my expectations?
Mandela had long been my personal hero, from my student days in the 1960’s, when – like so many others of my generation – I was an anti-apartheid activist.
We knew that the risks we ran of being roughed up or arrested while demonstrating against visiting Springbok rugby teams were entirely trivial compared to the risks that he and his colleagues had been prepared to face.
We could recite by heart the last words of his 1964 Rivonia Trial speech, one of the most thrilling affirmations of the human spirit ever uttered: “a free society…is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve.
But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.”
But how much of that dignity and idealism could possibly have survived the ordeal of 27 years in prison, most of that time on Robben Island in the South Atlantic?
I need not have worried.
Like so many others before and since, I was captivated from the first moment by Mandela’s huge, luminescent smile, by his unending charm and grace, and by the lucid intelligence with which he discussed his country’s transition problems.
But, above all, there was his extraordinary, almost unbelievable, lack of bitterness toward his Afrikaner jailers.
Mandela was, in fact, as keen to talk to me as I was to meet him.
He wanted to thank Australia for the very significant role our country had played in sustaining the pressure for change, particularly under Bob Hawke’s government, and in leading the global charge for financial sanctions on the apartheid regime.
So, sitting face to face across the Zambian president’s dining table, it was just the two of us, for an hour or more, chatting away comfortably about everything from United Nations sanctions to the end of the Cold War to our children’s careers.
Of all the meetings with all the leaders and other international figures around the world that I have had during all my years in public life, there is no question about which one gave me the most joy.
Mandela is simply the most impressive and decent human being I have ever met, or am ever likely to meet.
This was an impression, moreover, that did not fade with familiarity.
We met a number of times in the years that followed, on his visits to Australia and in South Africa – at his home in Soweto – and on one memorable occasion when I accompanied him to the opening match of the 1995 Rugby World Cup, at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town.
More than 50,000 South Africans – Afrikaners almost to a man, with hardly a black face in sight – were there to see their country play mine.
And, as their new president walked out onto the ground to greet the players, every single one of them seemed to bellow in enchanted union “Man-del-a!
Man-del-a!”
If Mandela’s leadership can be argued, as I think it can, to have been of a once-in-a-century quality, the opportunity to experience it first-hand was a once-in-a-lifetime privilege.
When it comes to national leadership at a time of fragility and transition, so much seems to depend on the luck of the draw.
Will a country find itself with a Milošević or a Mugabe; an Atatürk or an Arafat; a Rabin who can see and seize the moment, and change course, or someone who never will?
South Africa was lucky – almost miraculously so – to have had Nelson Mandela.
His memory will be cherished for as long as history continues to be written.
The Limits to Fighting the Islamic State
CANBERRA – There is a long history of misconceived and over-reaching foreign military intervention in the Middle East, and it is to be hoped that US President Barack Obama’s decision to wage war against the Islamic State will not prove to be another.
No terrorist group more richly deserves to be destroyed outright than these marauding, genocidal jihadists.
But as the US-led mission is currently conceived and described, it is not clear whether its objectives are achievable at acceptable costs in terms of time, money, and lives.
The basic problem is that the Islamic State’s territorial gains are being approached from three completely different perspectives, demanding three different types of operational responses.
There is the humanitarian mission to protect civilian populations in Iraq and Syria from mass-atrocity crimes.
There is the need to protect other states’ citizens from Islamic State terrorism.
And there is the desire to restore states’ integrity and stability in the region.
Obama’s rhetoric, and that of his most enthusiastic partner so far, Australia’s Prime Minister Tony Abbott, has wobbled between the first two objectives and hinted at the third, creating hopes and expectations that all three will be effectively pursued.
But only the humanitarian mission has any realistic chance of being delivered through the four-part strategy now on the table: air strikes against Islamic State forces; training, intelligence, and equipment for Iraqi and Kurdish military forces and Syria’s non-extremist opposition; intensified international counterterrorism efforts; and humanitarian assistance to displaced civilians.
It is obvious that Western-led military operations cannot by themselves re-establish the territorial integrity of Iraq or Syria, or restore wider regional stability.
Military intervention may help to hold the line against Iraq’s further disintegration and the spread of the Islamic State cancer into countries like Jordan.
But if 150,000 US troops could not stabilize Iraq in the absence of an inclusive and competent government, the limited measures on offer now simply will not suffice.
And we should know by now that any Western military intervention with overtly political, rather than clearly humanitarian, objectives runs a real risk of inflaming sectarian sentiment.
Things might be different if the US and other key players could simultaneously embark on a broad regional stabilization enterprise, but there are too many competing agendas to make this realistic for the foreseeable future.
The Sunni-Shia rivalry means that Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries will concede no meaningful role to Iran.
Nor will the West acknowledge Iran’s centrality to any multilateral process, for fear of losing negotiating leverage with respect to Iran’s nuclear program.
Few are willing to accept that Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, despite his abominable record, now almost certainly must be part of the solution.
And the open sore of the Israel-Palestine conflict plays into every other rivalry.
The counter-terrorism objective is more inherently plausible than that of political stabilization, and domestic politics in the US, Australia, and elsewhere probably require the prominence that it has received from Western leaders.
To the extent that their breeding ground can be destroyed, as Al Qaeda’s was in Afghanistan, there will be fewer newly minted terrorists to worry about.
But it is difficult to believe that a military campaign of the kind now contemplated, even with substantial support from Arab countries, can achieve that objective any time soon, or at an acceptable cost, in both Iraq and in the Islamic State’s Syrian havens.
The real burden will have to be borne, as now, by effective international cooperation in intelligence and policing.
The competence of Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces – crucial if territory is to be taken and held – will take time to build up, and may never be achievable with the so-called moderate forces within Syria.
Airstrikes anywhere risk civilian casualties – and thus the possibility of inflaming the very sentiments one is trying to counter.
Moreover, airstrikes in Syria without the government’s consent or Security Council authorization will be manifestly in breach of the United Nations Charter.
The prospect of Islamic State-inspired terrorist attacks in the US are not remotely real or imminent enough to justify reliance on the self-defense exception.
Hearts and minds matter in counterterrorism, and they become harder to win whenever the US and its supporters embark upon military action clearly in breach of international law.
The slow buy-in so far of Arab states to Obama’s campaign attests to the nervousness that many of them feel on all of these grounds.
By far the most defensible rationale for military action is – and has been from the outset – the humanitarian objective: the responsibility to protect populations at risk of genocide, ethnic cleansing, and other major crimes against humanity and war crimes.
I have argued that all of the conditions necessary in this context have been satisfied, and this will continue to be the case so long as the Islamic State maintains its horrifying modus operandi.
Operating within this framework, US and coalition forces would clearly be entitled to disrupt, degrade, and seek to destroy the Islamic State’s capability in a way that would also serve the counter-terrorist objective.
But the primary objective for intervention would remain unequivocally humanitarian, and as such would be much less susceptible to anti-Western blowback than any other mission.
There may even be considerable international tolerance for some carefully defined and limited action in Syria in the event of an obvious imminent humanitarian threat.
If the campaign against the Islamic State is defined and conducted with humanitarian protection as its primary and overwhelming objective, it should succeed not only in stopping further atrocities, but also in making large inroads into curbing the wider terrorist threat at its source.
If the West strays from that primary goal, the enterprise is likely to end in tears, like so many others in the Middle East.
Buying into Bitcoin
LONDON – The Internet currency Bitcoin is surrounded by uncertainty.
Is it a speculative bubble?
Is it really as anonymous as its proponents claim?
Can one actually use it to purchase the legendary White Widow strain of marijuana, or to hire a hit man?
These are certainly interesting questions, but they are diverting attention from far more important discussions about Bitcoin’s potential to drive financial-sector innovation.
Bitcoin is so innovative, in fact, that beyond breaking the conventions of currency, it has even transcended partisan ideologies.
Indeed, the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman and US Tea Party icon Ron Paul are diametrically opposed on virtually every issue but Bitcoin (both deeply dislike it).
And yet Bitcoin’s opponents should be asking how the groundbreaking ideas that underlie it could be applied to reforming the global financial system.
Although the 2008 financial crisis exposed profound institutional shortcomings, the response – including heightened regulatory safeguards like the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act in the United States and the Basel III banking standards – has failed to bring about the needed transformation.
Likewise, protest movements like Occupy Wall Street, aimed at raising awareness of – and ultimately reforming – the culture of finance, have delivered mixed results.
But the fact is that no one – except perhaps the small coterie of financial insiders who have benefited enormously from taxpayer-financed bailouts – should be satisfied with the current system, not least because another crisis, most likely accompanied by more bank bailouts, can reasonably be expected in the not-so-distant future.
While the exact timing of the next meltdown cannot be known, one thing is certain: consideration of what kind of financial system would best serve the world in the twenty-first century would be incomplete without Bitcoin.
After all, the technology behind it could not only help to reduce systemic risk by creating safeguards shielding the payments system from useful but unpredictable financial activities; it could also play an important role in bolstering much-needed economic growth.
Financial institutions essentially act as matchmakers, linking investors, borrowers, and savers, and recording what people own and owe.
In exchange for these services, financial professionals are compensated very generously.
So, to ask whether bankers’ massive paychecks are fair is really to ask how much value is created by financial matchmaking – a question to which there is no simple answer.
What is clear is that, by allowing a greater proportion of an economy’s wealth to be channeled toward investment and other productive economic activities, a more efficient financial-services industry boosts economic growth.
In other words, the financial-services industry can be viewed as a kind of tax on the rest of the economy.
And, given the high costs of financial systems that are antiquated, costly, and inefficient – in London, for example, paper checks must physically be sent from one bank to another, meaning that it takes 5-6 days for the funds to be transferred – the smaller the financial system, the better off everyone else will be.
The inefficiency of the world’s financial system is not simply a result of obsolete rules and structures; profit-seeking is also a major factor.
While British authorities recently announced that the transfer of physical checks would be abolished, a two-day check-clearing delay will remain.
Given that scanned images of checks could easily be processed electronically almost instantaneously, the enduring delay can be explained only by “float” – that is, the interest earned by holding onto money for as long as possible.
Float is just one of the many ways the financial-services industry extracts resources from the economy.
The 3-5% charge levied by credit-card companies works out to several hundred billion dollars in annual profits for companies like Visa and MasterCard.
Fees for wire transfers and for exchanging currency can quickly climb to 10% or more per transaction, with interruptions and complex procedures making such services even more costly.
But there is reason for hope.
With the innovations pioneered by Bitcoin, the fees, delays, and other inefficiencies that serve to line the pockets of those in the financial-services industry can largely be eliminated.
Ahead of US Senate hearings last November, former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke wrote a letter to senators saying that Bitcoin may “hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure, and more efficient payment system.”
As if on cue, the US retail giant Target was hacked – another episode in a long string of major financial-data heists.
Bitcoin, with its capacity for anonymity, could certainly help to make the global financial system more secure, saving consumers and businesses significant inconvenience and expense.
At the same time, it offers an alternative store of value, and its use as a medium of exchange is steadily growing.
But perhaps the most exciting innovation offered by Bitcoin is the “blockchain” – peer-to-peer software that keeps a record of all transactions and a tally of who owns what.
The blockchain essentially serves the “ledger” function that banks do today, but at a fraction of the cost to consumers and businesses.
Powered by an open-source algorithm and maintained by anyone who chooses to download the free software, Bitcoin marks a return to a community-based approach to money and banking, with financial services more closely connected to the people who use them.
Large, monolithic third-party managers like today’s “too big to fail” banks would be cut out.
Indeed, with software like the blockchain powering a new financial architecture, “the people” would effectively become the bank.
Bitcoin and its ecosystem are still maturing, and only time will tell if current price levels reflect a speculative bubble.
But the innovations pioneered by Bitcoin can – and therefore should – play a transformative role in building a safer, less expensive, and more effective financial system.
The Right Time to Reform Fuel Pricing
CAMBRIDGE – World oil prices, which have been highly volatile during the last decade, have fallen more than 50% over the past year.
The economic effects have been negative overall for oil-exporting countries, and positive for oil-importing countries.
But what about effects that are not directly economic?
If we care about environmental and other externalities, should we want oil prices to go up, because that will discourage oil consumption, or down because that will discourage oil production?
The answer is that countries should seek to do both: Lower the price paid to oil producers and raise the price paid by oil consumers, by cutting subsidies for oil and refined products or raising taxes on them.
Many emerging-market countries have taken advantage of falling oil prices to implement such reforms.
The United States, which is now surprisingly close to energy self-sufficiency, so that the macroeconomic effects roughly balance, should follow suit.
Consider this: America’s roads and bridges are crumbling, and the national transportation infrastructure requires investment and maintenance.
And yet the US Congress shamefully continues to evade its responsibility to fund the Federal Highway Trust Fund and put it on a sound long-term basis, owing to disagreement over how to pay for it.
The obvious solution, which economists have long advocated, is an increase in America’s gasoline taxes.
The federal gas tax has been stuck at 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993, the lowest among advanced countries.
And yet, on July 30, Congress adopted only a three-month stopgap measure, kicking the gas can down the road for the 35th time since 2009.
Fossil-fuel pricing is a striking exception to the general rule that if the government has only one policy instrument, it can achieve only one policy objective.
For starters, the money saved from a reduction in subsidies or an increase in taxes in the oil sector could be used either to reduce budget deficits or to fund desirable spending (such as US highway construction and maintenance).
At the same time, lower oil consumption would reduce traffic congestion and accidents, limit local air pollution and its adverse health effects, and lower greenhouse-gas emissions, which lead to global climate change.
Fuel taxes are a more efficient way to achieve these environmental goals than most of the alternatives.
There is also a national-security rationale.
If the retail price of fuel is low, domestic consumption will be high.
High oil consumption leaves a country vulnerable to oil-market disruptions arising, for example, from instability in the Middle East.
If gas taxes are high and consumption is low, as in Europe, fluctuations in the world price of oil have a smaller effect domestically.
Subsidies to US oil producers have often been sold on national-security grounds; in fact, a policy to “drain America first” reduces self-sufficiency in the longer run.
Finally, although fuel subsidies are often misleadingly sold as a way to improve income distribution, the reality is more nearly the opposite.
Worldwide, fossil-fuel subsidies are regressive: far less than 20% of the payments benefit the poorest 20% of the population.
Poor people are not the ones who do most of the driving; rather, they tend to use public transportation (or walk).
The conventional wisdom is that it is politically impossible in the US to increase the gas tax.
But other countries have political constraints, too.
Indeed, some developing-country governments have faced civil unrest, even coups, over fuel taxes or subsidies.
Yet Egypt, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates have all reduced or abolished various fuel subsidies in the last year.
Besides raising taxes on fuel consumption, the US should also stop some of its subsidies for oil production.
Oil companies can immediately deduct a high percentage of their drilling costs from their tax liability, which other industries cannot do with their investments.
Likewise, the oil industry has often been able to drill on federal land and offshore without paying the full market rate for the leases.
Most politicians know that sound economics would call for these benefits to be eliminated; but those who complain the loudest that the government must not pick corporate winners and losers seem to be the least able to summon the political will to act.
A recent study by the International Monetary Fund estimated that global energy subsidies are running at more than $5 trillion per year, while fossil-fuel subsidies in the US have been conservatively valued at $37 billion per year (not including the cost of environmental externalities).
As leaders in emerging-market countries have recognized, falling oil prices represent the best opportunity to implement reform.
Governments that act now can reduce energy subsidies or increase taxes while sparing consumers an increase in the retail price from one year to the next.
For the US and other advanced countries, it is also a good time for reform from a macroeconomic standpoint.
In the past, countries had to worry that a rising fuel tax could become built into uncomfortably high inflation rates.
Currently, however, central bankers are not worried about inflation, except in the sense that they want it to be a little higher.
The US Congress will have to come back to highway funding in September.
If other countries have found that what was politically impossible has suddenly turned out to be possible, why not the US?
Promises to Keep in 2016
DAVOS – We live in extraordinary times.
Each day seems to bring fresh headlines about an unfolding crisis – whether it is migration, economic volatility, security, or climate change.
One factor common to all these complex and unprecedented challenges is poverty; so eliminating it will make overcoming them significantly easier.
There is good reason for optimism about progress on reducing inequity.
Since the turn of the century, remarkable strides have been taken toward a world in which every person has the chance to lead a healthy, productive life.
Maternal deaths have almost halved; child mortality and malaria deaths have halved; extreme poverty has more than halved.
And last year, the world signed up to finish the job.
The centerpiece of the Global Goals to which the United Nations’ 193 countries agreed in September is to end poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030.
We are confident that this is not only possible, but that we will see major breakthroughs along the way, which will provide unprecedented opportunities to people in poor countries.
Indeed, we think their lives will improve faster in the next 15 years than at any other time in history – and that their lives will improve more than anyone else’s.
But while progress is possible, it is not inevitable.
Success will require political will, global cooperation, and human ingenuity – a message we are taking into our various meetings and engagements at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week.
For our part, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will focus on the areas of greatest need and take risks that others can’t or won’t.
This year, we are concentrating our efforts in three broad areas.
First, we will continue to support the institutions that helped get us to where we are now.
Since 2002, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has unlocked an unprecedented wealth of human and financial resources to combat infectious diseases that disproportionately affect the poorest.
By providing medicines, training doctors and nurses, and building stronger health-care systems, the Global Fund has so far helped save 17 million lives.
That is some achievement.
And the Fund’s pledge conference later this year will be another opportunity to help build a better world.
We need to make the most of it – not only to help save up to eight million more lives, but also to support health systems in low-income countries and thereby reduce the risk of future health crises.
Similarly, since the start of the decade, nearly four million more people are alive today because they were immunized against infectious diseases, thanks in large part to the work of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
In the next five years, Gavi and its partners are positioned to immunize another 300 million people, helping millions more children and young people survive and thrive – and thereby boosting developing-country economies.
Second, women and girls will be at the heart of our endeavors.
By any measure, the world is a better place for women and girls than ever before.
But it’s still not nearly good enough.
They need better access to health care, especially family-planning services; expanded economic opportunities; and more decision-making power over their own lives (which in turn requires greater social participation and public leadership).
Empowering women and girls to transform their lives is one of the smartest investments we can make.
Improving their health and wellbeing, ensuring they get a good education, and unleashing their economic potential are fundamental to building more prosperous communities and countries.
But we need to improve our understanding of how best to empower women to succeed.
And in order to overcome centuries of gender inequity, we need more momentum behind this agenda.
The Women Deliver conference in May is the next global opportunity to push for more action and for donors to demonstrate their commitment.
Third, we will invest in innovation.
Scientific and technological advances – from new vaccines and hardier crops to much cheaper smartphones and tablets – are among the greatest drivers of poverty reduction.
In just the last few weeks, the world has shown that it is prepared to spend more to find new ways to provide reliable, affordable, clean energy sources.
This is one of the most important ways to help poor people cope with climate change.
Meanwhile, innovations in health care have already brought the world close to wiping out polio, and we expect to see dramatic results from a new triple drug therapy that could eradicate elephantiasis, which affects 120 million people.
But the hard truth is that current funding for research and development to address the health needs of the world’s poorest people is insufficient.
And the tools and technologies we have now aren’t enough to get us to where we need to be.
If we want to achieve the targets established by the Global Goals for maternal health, child health, and infectious disease, we will have to double R&D funding by 2020.
That is why we must ensure that R&D is on the agenda at the G7 summit in Japan in May, with a focus on developing and deploying products that both save lives and dramatically improve the economic prospects of the poorest.
Sustained support for institutions like the Global Fund and Gavi, for the empowerment of women and girls, and for innovation is crucial to accelerating progress for the world’s poorest people.
But much more can and should be done.
The world must unite behind all efforts to eradicate poverty as a vital first step toward overcoming the many other challenges – from migration to terrorism – that we face today.
The daily headlines all too often reflect the gap between today’s world and a world without poverty.
But what the headlines don’t reveal is all the ways life is already getting better for those in greatest need.
If we keep our promises to them, it will be front-page news.
LGBT at Work
DAVOS – When Apple CEO Tim Cook announced last year that he is gay, I was inundated by emails and telephone messages from executives around the world.
As an “out” executive at Ernst & Young (EY), everyone seemed to want to know what I thought this meant for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) inclusion on a global scale.
Apple, after all, resides in fifth place on the Fortune 500 list of the world’s largest companies.
Was this the end of the “lavender ceiling”?
In his Bloomberg Businessweek article, Cook describes how being gay has affected him: “I’m proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.
Being gay has given me a deeper understanding of what it means to be in the minority and provided a window into the challenges that people in other minority groups deal with every day.”
My own experience of being “different” is multifaceted.
Like Cook, being in the minority informed my propensity to be an inclusive leader.
Unlike Cook, in addition to being closeted, I was a woman and an introvert, and my politics tended to differ from those of my peers in my heavily male, extrovert-dominated profession.
Since coming out in 2011, I have been publicly truer to myself and more authentic with others.
That has made me a better leader.
And being out in a leadership position in a global organization has provided me a platform to talk openly on a wide range of issues.
There is no question about it: Cook’s announcement was a huge step forward.
And international organizations have made considerable progress in LGBT inclusion by relying on external and employee networks and non-discrimination policies.
But most of today’s available statistics reflect progress in Europe and the United States.
According to a recent study by the women’s advocacy organization Catalyst, 62% of Fortune 500 companies now offer health insurance to domestic partners, while 87% of Fortune 500 companies – and 94 of the top 100 – have non-discrimination policies that include sexual orientation.
By contrast, Todd Sears, founder of Out Leadership, an advocacy group for LGBT employees, estimates that 90% of LGBT workers in Asia are closeted.
In 78 countries, including Uganda and Nigeria, being gay is still illegal.
Singapore recently upheld its stringent anti-homosexuality law.
In Russia, on the same day Cook made his announcement, a memorial to Apple founder Steve Jobs was dismantled, ostensibly to comply with a law prohibiting “gay propaganda.”
Even in the US, where members of the same sex can marry in 35 states (as I did in New York last April), in 29 states it is still legal to fire someone solely on the basis of their sexual orientation.
In 34 states, it is legal to fire a transgender employee.
That said, multinational companies can take several steps to further their LGBT inclusion strategies on a global scale.
For starters, they can strengthen the “ally effect.”
Research conducted by the Center for Talent Innovation shows that allies – people who support LGBT colleagues or work as advocates – play a decisive role in creating an inclusive community.
In fact, 24% of the LGBT workers surveyed attribute their decision to come out professionally to their network of allies.
Employers can create networks that invite straight colleagues to support their LGBT co-workers and sponsor LGBT individuals and groups.
Likewise, senior executives being visibly out makes a huge difference.
Cook is a great example.
LGBT employees are 85% more likely to be out at companies where senior executives are out (24% versus 13%).
At EY, our LGBT leadership participated in the “It Gets Better” video project in 2011, sharing stories for the benefit of at-risk LGBT youth. I took advantage of the opportunity, and, with the full support of EY’s leadership, officially came out.
I not only talked openly about my own experiences; I also shared how my organization’s philosophy played an important role in my decision.
That leads to a more general point: The more people hear, see, and know about what is going on in an organization, the more quickly cultural change takes place.
Speaking up is an important part of that, because people not only listen to what is said, but also notice what passes without being challenged.
Too often, when an organization does not correct a misstatement, it is taken as agreement.
Customized solutions also help.
Companies should meet with LGBT groups at other organizations, both locally and globally, and implement policies from the more progressive regions in which they do business (say, Europe and the US).
But one size does not fit all.
Strategies work best when they are tailored to fit the requirements of specific conditions, such as geographic locations, business unit type, or department function.
Finally, companies should continue to facilitate an inclusive workplace for everyone, not just LGBT employees.
That means shifting from a culture of diversity, with its implicit focus on “them,” to an inclusiveness-centered culture of “us.”
Cook and I share many of the same attitudes about our LGBT identity.
And I find that his announcement accords with my own experience: “[Being gay has] made me more empathetic, which has led to a richer life.
It’s been tough and uncomfortable at times, but it has given me the confidence to be myself, to follow my own path, and to rise above adversity and bigotry.”
The lavender ceiling has been cracked, but there is nowhere in the world today where inclusiveness has been fully achieved.
There is still much more to do.
Gaza Shrugs
GAZA CITY – Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has now personally presented Palestine’s bid for full United Nations membership to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon.
What remains to be seen is whether Hamas, which has controlled the Gaza Strip since June 2007, will eventually support this initiative by its bitter rival, Abbas’s West Bank-based Palestinian Authority.
The failure for more than a year to make any progress in negotiations with Israel has convinced Abbas and his colleagues to pursue the UN option.
And Israel’s continuing settlement construction on the West Bank has sharpened their sense that negotiations would not be productive, whereas the raft of UN resolutions supporting a two-state solution could now be put to the test.
Moreover, it is widely believed that the Arab Spring has encouraged the Palestinian leadership to seek to change the rules of the game.
Arabs throughout the region, though preoccupied with domestic affairs, are nonetheless pressing a new generation of leaders to support the Palestinian cause more actively.
The collapse of Hosni Mubarak’s regime in Egypt, the subsequent departure of the Israeli ambassador from Cairo, the political upheaval in Syria, and the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador from Ankara are causing great uncertainty in Israeli leadership circles.
Israel is more isolated regionally and internationally than ever, owing to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu diplomatic failures.
Abbas, whose bid is supported unanimously by the Arab and most Islamic countries, is convinced that the Arabs will stand with the Palestinians, regardless of the consequences.
More than 120 countries are believed to support the Palestinian bid for statehood.
But the Palestinians must secure the approval of the UN Security Council and the support of two-thirds of the UN General Assembly in order to gain full official recognition.
The US has threatened to veto the resolution in the Security Council, and the US Congress has threatened to suspend American aid to the Palestinian Authority.
Members of the European Union are still divided and continue to hope for a compromise and other options.
Israel has denounced the Palestinian strategy as a unilateral initiative, and has threatened the Palestinians with severe reprisals.
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman suggested canceling the Oslo Accords, signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization in September 1993, which provided the basis for the creation of the Palestinian Authority in 1994.
Israel is also considering a suspension of transfers of Palestinian tax and customs revenues, and has threatened to annex parts of the West Bank.
At the same time, Hamas suspects that Abbas’s effort to gain UN recognition is intended to impose pressure on Netanyahu to revive peace negotiations on the basis of the 1967 borders, a position that Hamas rejects.
Hamas believes that if Israel were to come under pressure and, for example, freeze settlement construction, Abbas’s position would be strengthened.
Hamas slammed Abbas’s speech at the UN and his bid for statehood, because it relinquishes 78% of historic Palestine and endangers Palestinian refugees’ right of return.
Meanwhile, the significance of the reconciliation agreement signed last May by Hamas and Fatah, the secular nationalist movement that controls the Palestinian Authority, remains uncertain.
While some commentators were hopeful that the agreement meant that Hamas would give its tacit support to Abbas’s negotiating strategy, this is doubtful.
Indeed, Hamas is convinced that any success for Abbas and the Palestinian Authority will further discredit its rule and increase its isolation in besieged Gaza.
Hamas’s support for Palestinian statehood within the 1967 borders would convey at least indirect recognition of Israel.
Yet Hamas continues to reject territorial concessions, insisting that all of historic Palestine must be under Muslim jurisdiction.
The Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, suffering for more than four years from siege and isolation, are apathetic to the UN bid.
They already feel alienated from the state-building efforts on the West Bank by Salam Fayyad’s government.
Poverty and unemployment have left them frustrated and desperate, and the slowdown in implementing the Hamas-Fatah reconciliation agreement gives them little hope of meaningful change.
If Palestine does achieve full UN membership, Palestinians recognize that it will be little more than symbolic.
After all, more than 100 countries already recognized Palestine after Yasser Arafat declared the establishment of a state on November 15, 1988.
Moreover, Palestinians are not convinced that UN recognition will change their daily lives as long as the international community takes no action to end the Israeli occupation on the West Bank and the siege and blockade of Gaza.
However, the Palestinian bid at the UN will internationalize the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and discredit US mediating leverage.
As always, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict stands perched between diplomacy and violence.
It remains for the US, working with Israel and the international community, to break this logjam and press forward toward a settlement.
But the ultimate failure of Abbas’s diplomatic strategy – the absence of tangible benefits even if it succeeds – will damage what is left of his credibility among the Palestinians and strengthen Hamas’s political clout.
A National Security Blind Spot
WASHINGTON, DC – Erin Saltman saw a disturbing trend.
For months, the senior counter-extremism researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue had obsessively tracked the profiles of more than 130 Western women who had joined the Islamic State (ISIS).
Saltman and her team noticed that instead of journeying through Turkey to reach ISIS headquarters in Syria, the women were heading straight to Libya.
Because women’s roles within ISIS are related mostly to reproduction and consolidating territory, Saltman was able to deduce the reason: “ISIS wasn’t just looking to have combat forces in Libya, but also to build statehood there,” she explained.
“We flagged and highlighted that before security forces were aware of it.”
To Saltman, investing time and money to think about the differences between men’s and women’s movement in ISIS wasn’t “about gender equality.
It was about having a better grasp on the security issues at hand.”
It’s a radical idea.
Considering the divergent ways men and women might act, think, or respond is not just ticking a politically correct box.
It can actually help us craft better policy and identify emerging threats.
Yet many policymakers in the United States and around the world still don’t seem able to grasp that examining the behavior of women and men alike can improve their analysis and their proposed measures.
New America recently conducted unprecedented research to find out whether and how, after nearly two decades of research, data, and advocacy has crystallized the crucial linkage between gender and national security, US officials consider it when formulating policy.
The short answer is: they mostly don’t.
That’s akin to a nearsighted person choosing to forgo glasses when surveying a new landscape.
Ignoring the impact that gender differences have on policy effectiveness is reckless and risky.
Many countries, including the US, pay lip service.
Nearly 80 countries have adopted a National Action Plan to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, which sets forth a blueprint for engaging women in all aspects of security policy.
But action plans have not translated into active consideration of the gender-differentiated effects of policies.
According to our research, policymakers think they are overcoming their gender blind spot because more women are sitting around the table.
Including more women on decision-making teams, it is assumed, will automatically integrate gender considerations into policy.
That assumption has yet to be proved.
Quite the contrary.
Consider Germany’s refugee and immigration policies.
Although Germany has a National Action Plan, is 11th on the Global Gender Gap Index (which ranks countries on levels of gender equality), and has a strong female chancellor and its first-ever female defense minister, it still failed at first to consider how its policy might have different effects on men and women.
For example, most government refugee shelters didn’t provide gender-exclusive toilets and showers – a disaster for women from conservative Islamic backgrounds.
Likewise, the intensive language program the government required for migrants didn’t account for women’s inability to attend class without childcare.
Ultimately, such failures made those policies less effective for the entire population, and could lead to long-term security consequences for Germany.
Our interviews also suggest that some policymakers still regard gender-blindness positively: not thinking about the possible gender-specific effects of policies, they believe, contributes to an atmosphere of greater gender equality.
But decades of research have shown that inclusion and equality should not mean ignoring differences between underrepresented groups.
“The consequence of policy is often the same for men and women,” one respondent told our research partners at POLITICO Focus.
“Hearing myself say that gives me pause.
I have no idea what that conclusion is actually based on — am I just regurgitating the company line?”
In fact, the consequence of policy often isn’t the same for men and women, in part because they tend to have unequal access to opportunities and resources.
But policymakers often claim an absence of data about different impacts, particularly data that can be mapped onto national security objectives.
“It’s difficult to break things down by gender impact,” one person said.
“Human rights and aid organizations are better at this; our [national security] tools aren’t that granular.
And oftentimes, you’re measuring success anecdotally when it comes to things like gender and education data.”
But plenty of research cements the gender and security connection.
Data2X, WomanStats, and Inclusive Security are just a few of the many organizations that have made it their mission to gather in global databases this kind of gender-differentiated data and research, providing irrefutable and empirical proof that women’s status is inextricably linked to state power, stability, corruption, prosperity, and many other indicators.
In other words, weak, unstable, corrupt, and poor states are states where women’s status is low.
Most policymakers would draw the conclusion that strengthening and cleaning up government and promoting economic growth will improve the status of women.
But what if the causal arrows run in the opposite direction?
Unlike our policymakers, ISIS is not waiting for more data. It actively exploits gender inequality to aid recruitment and operations.
In societies where women are treated like second-class citizens, ISIS has an easier time recruiting women with its quasi-female empowerment propaganda, like one image that shows a woman clad in a burqa with the words “Covered girl...because I’m worth it.”
Once women have committed, they may be able to avoid suspicion and pass through security checkpoints more easily; security officials and policymakers still overwhelmingly view women exclusively as non-threatening victims of violent conflicts.
International policymakers need to think about gender, too, in the fight against ISIS – and across all other national-security and foreign-policy contexts.
It is certainly important to have women at the table.
But it is equally important that all policymakers discuss the women who aren’t there and never will be.
The Right Diet for Gender Equality
COPENHAGEN – During the last century, the battle to secure equality for women and girls has been fought in the classroom, in the voting booth, and in the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies.
But if gender inequality is ever to be abolished, we can no longer afford to neglect one of its major causes and consequences: malnutrition.
Right now, a staggering 1.6 billion people worldwide suffer from anemia, a condition strongly connected to iron deficiency – and one of the symptoms of a global nutrition crisis that disproportionally affects women.
Indeed, anemia afflicts twice as many women as men – nearly one in three women and girls worldwide – and contributes to one-fifth of all maternal deaths.
In 2012, the World Health Assembly endorsed a target to reduce the rate of anemia by 50% by 2025.
But, at the current rate of progress, this target will not be reached until 2124.
Despite hard-won gains for women, we remain a century behind schedule on an issue that is key to their health and development – and to that of their children.
But there is hope.
If we invest in better nutrition now, we can ensure a brighter future for girls and women everywhere – for the next hundred years and beyond.
We can no longer treat gender discrimination and malnutrition as separate issues.
The two are inextricably linked; they reinforce each another in a pattern that touches women at every stage of their lives.
Malnutrition – in all of its forms – is both a cause and an effect of the profound power imbalance between men and women.
Gender inequality begins in the womb.
Every year, 16 million adolescent girls give birth, most in low- and middle-income countries.
If a mother lives in an area where stunting rates are high and she is in her mid-teens, her child is more likely to be stunted – and thus more susceptible to disease and largely irreversible cognitive underdevelopment, adversely affecting their ability to benefit from education and reach their full potential.
These children will usually go on to earn less, which increases their likelihood of living in poverty, being malnourished, and, as a result, facing a higher risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension later in life.
And, given the societal and economic biases against women in most countries, these early life circumstances place girls at an even more severe disadvantage.
The cycle then repeats itself; these disempowered and malnourished women give birth to stunted babies, perpetuating the cycle of inequality.
To improve nutrition outcomes for girls and women, we need to scale up proven nutrition interventions and ensure that other development programs take nutrition into account.
It is critical, for example, that we promote early and immediate breastfeeding – an incredibly powerful tool against both stunting and obesity.
Development policies and programs must also take gender imbalances into consideration.
Social protection programs that improve women’s control of income transfers, for example, are linked to better nutrition outcomes for them and their families.
In many countries, women eat last in the family, reducing their chances of getting the right nutrition.
Maternity and breastfeeding provisions are also weak, making it difficult for women to nurse their children.
Behavior-change programs, communication, and role modeling can all be helpful in weakening the grip of harmful social norms concerning nutrition and gender.
Accomplishing this will require a blueprint for political action.
On June 14, the 2016 Global Nutrition Report will launch globally.
The report aims to assess progress, improve accountability for meeting global commitments, and recommend actions for government and key stakeholders to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030.
The conversation must begin today.
This week, the Women Deliver 2016 Conference – the largest meeting of girls’ and women’s advocates in a decade – is taking place in Copenhagen.
More than 5,000 global leaders, policymakers, and advocates from 150 countries are convening to discuss, among other issues, how to break the cycle of poverty and gender inequality that undermines women’s health.
The call for action to sever the link between nutrition and gender inequality must be loud enough to echo around the world.
We must eliminate all factors that perpetuate gender inequality.
And that starts with better nutrition for all.
The next century of progress depends on it.
The Unfinished Sexual Revolution
WASHINGTON, DC – In the United States, the revolution for equality between men and women is stuck halfway.
Over the past 50 years, women’s roles have changed dramatically, with almost 60% of American women now in the workforce.
Men’s roles, however, have barely budged.
Despite insisting on the equal dignity and value of men and women, we still regard men’s traditional work of breadwinning as more valuable and important than women’s traditional work of caregiving.
The result is a profound social and economic imbalance that is holding back women and men alike.
The solution is to focus less on women and more on elevating the value of care and expanding the roles and choices open to men.
Electing and appointing more women to powerful roles remains essential.
But focusing on women’s advancement is biased toward tracking how many are rising to the top: the overall percentage at work, their average salaries, and how many become CEOs, senior managers, tenured professors, bankers, surgeons, law partners, parliamentarians, presidents, and ministers.
A focus on care, by contrast, opens the door to the dual problem of too few women at the top and far too many at the bottom.
American women hold less than 15% of executive-level positions in Fortune 500 companies and 62% of minimum-wage jobs.
As a result, one in three adult women are living in or on the edge of poverty, with the picture especially bleak for single mothers, almost two-thirds of whom are working in dead-end, poorly compensated jobs without flexibility or benefits.
What is common to both sets of women, and all the women in between, is that they are still charged with primary responsibility for caregiving – for children, parents, and other family members – in a system that devalues and provides little support for the care work they do.
Although wealthy women can and do buy the care work of poorer women, many also choose to work part-time or flexibly to provide the stimulation and education their children need.
But many professional women’s career advancement is systematically blocked should they choose this path.
If a young female lawyer or banker on a promising career track decides to leave the office “early” every day to be home with her kids for dinner, work part-time, or take time out to be a full-time caregiver, she is quickly knocked out of the competition for top jobs.
And if she decides to devote herself to full-time caregiving, that time becomes a black mark on her résumé, a hole that she must vainly try to hide or explain away if and when she tries to re-enter the job market.
A woman at the bottom faces an even harsher reality.
She is likely to be a single mother who has no choice but to be the sole breadwinner and caregiver for her family.
Half of single mothers in the US make less than $25,000 a year.
Compared to single parents in other high-income countries, American single parents have the highest poverty rate and the weakest income-support system.
No US state provides affordable daycare, early education, and after-school programs that take up the caregiving slack.
Only a few states provide paid leave that any worker can use when a child is sick.
The result is that a mother with dependent children must patch together an unstable and unreliable network of caregivers in ways that sharply hamper her ability to succeed at her job and climb out of poverty.
Other advanced industrial countries are far ahead of the US in providing an entire infrastructure of care to help families invest in the next generation and care for their own parents.
Indeed, virtually every developing country in the world is ahead of the US in at least requiring paid maternity leave.
But before foreign observers get too smug, consider the other solution to America’s unfinished revolution.
Valuing care means valuing it enough to expect men to take on caregiving responsibilities to the same extent that we now expect women to take on breadwinning.
Of course, any couple will divide up breadwinning and caregiving work according to their individual circumstances and personalities.
In a genuinely equal world, men and women would approach this division of labor the same way a same-sex couple does.
When it is two men or two women figuring out how to provide an income for their family and to turn that income into the food, shelter, clothing, nurture, education, discipline, and moral support needed to raise children, they cannot rely on societally imposed default roles.
They turn to different criteria: Who has the bigger income?
Who is more ambitious?
Who has the more flexible job?
Who has a boss or company that better supports reconciling work and family obligations?
Attitudes about male caregiving are beginning to shift in the US.
Only a third of millennial men believe in traditional gender roles.
America’s biggest tech companies are beginning to compete for talent by offering paternity leave.
Scandinavian countries and Germany have led the way on paternity leave in Europe, yet many European men (and certainly Asian, African, Indian, and Latin American men) have a long way to go with regard to shedding traditional attitudes about the male/female division of labor.
It is one thing to let women into the workforce; it is quite another to embrace full equality and create a cultural, economic, and social climate that encourages both men and women to support one another and their families equally with cash and care.
That is what it will take, however, to complete the unfinished business of the movement for women’s equality.
What’s Blocking Gender Equality?
BERKELEY – One year ago, the United Nations adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), one of which aims for true gender equality by 2030.
Empowering women and girls is morally right and economically smart.
Several recent studies confirm that there are substantial economic- and human-development costs associated with pervasive and significant gender gaps in economic opportunities and outcomes.
A recent report by the UN Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel, which we authored, identifies actions that governments, businesses, nongovernmental organizations, and multilateral development agencies can take now to close these gaps and accelerate progress toward achieving the SDGs’ overarching goal of inclusive economic growth.
The report shows that greater gender equality in a country is associated with better education and health, higher per capita income, faster and more inclusive economic growth, and greater international competitiveness.
A widely cited McKinsey Global Institute study finds that closing gender gaps in labor-force participation rates, part-time versus full-time work, and the composition of employment would add 12-25% to global GDP by 2025.
Other studies, using a variety of methodologies, find similar prospective gains, especially in low-fertility countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Germany, and in countries (for example, in the Persian Gulf) with low labor-force participation rates for women.
The business case for gender quality is also compelling, because women make substantial contributions to all parts of the value chain.
The UN report identifies numerous benefits for companies that have pursued gender equality in employment, pay, and leadership, including the ability to attract, motivate, and retain talented workers, and to address complex problems with more diverse teams.
And several new studies find that companies with more women in top leadership and board positions have higher financial returns.
More than 90% of girls worldwide now finish primary school, and more women than men are now graduating from college in most regions.
Yet, despite these gains, large gender gaps persist in all kinds of work – whether paid or unpaid, formal or informal, public or private, agricultural or entrepreneurial.
Globally, only 50% of women aged 15 and above are in paid employment, compared with about 75% of men.
At the same time, women do about three times more unpaid work than men do.
When women are paid, their jobs tend to reflect gender stereotypes and provide relatively low earnings, poor working conditions, and limited opportunities for career advancement.
Even when women perform the same or equal-value jobs as men, they are paid less, on average (although the size of the pay gap varies considerably around the world).
Women are under-represented in leadership positions in both business and government.
And, compared to businesses owned by men, enterprises owned by women are smaller, employ fewer people, and are more concentrated in sectors with limited opportunities for profit and growth.
The UN report identifies four overarching and interconnected factors that impede gender equality in all forms of work, and at all levels of development: adverse social norms, discriminatory laws and insufficient legal protections, gender gaps in unpaid household and care work, and unequal access to digital, financial, and property assets.
Social norms determine economic outcomes for women in several ways: they shape women’s decisions about which occupational and educational opportunities to pursue; they affect the distribution of unpaid work within households and wages in paid care activities such as nursing and teaching, which employ a high proportion of women; and they reflect and reinforce discriminatory gender stereotypes and implicit biases that limit women’s pay and promotion prospects.
In many countries, adverse social norms are also codified in laws that limit women’s professional choices and their ability to obtain passports, travel outside their homes, start businesses, and own or inherit property.
A recent International Monetary Fund analysis finds that this kind of legal discrimination is associated with lower levels of educational attainment for women, wider gender-pay gaps, and fewer women-owned businesses.
Moreover, according to the World Bank, 103 countries do not legally mandate gender non-discrimination in hiring, and 101 do not require equal remuneration for work of equal value in formal-sector jobs.
Hundreds of millions of women work informally, without any protection, either in law or in practice, of their social and labor rights.
In India, for example, some 120 million women (around 95% of women in paid labor) work informally, as do around 12 million women in Mexico (around 60% of employed women).
People working informally often have no voice to demand better workplace conditions or pay, and this is especially true for women, who also face sexual harassment, violence, and restrictions on their reproductive rights.
Large gender gaps in unpaid work and care are a major driver of diminished economic opportunities for women.
The household work and care responsibilities of women are reflected in a sizeable “motherhood pay penalty.”
Around the world, mothers with dependent children earn, on average, less than women without dependent children, and less than fathers with similar household and employment characteristics.
In fact, there is some evidence of a “fatherhood pay premium” – a positive relationship between a man’s wages and how many children he has.
Reducing and redistributing the time required for unpaid care responsibilities requires investments by both the private and public sectors – in infrastructure, affordable care services, early childhood education, family leave, and family-friendly workplaces.
Such investments are beneficial not only for individuals and families, but also for businesses and the economy as a whole, because they increase women’s labor-force participation rates and productivity, create paid jobs in care services, and improve children’s school performance, boosting their future educational-attainment levels and productivity.
Drawing on evidence from around the world, the UN report provides numerous examples of proven and possible measures to tackle the constraints on women’s economic opportunities.
At this year’s annual World Bank and IMF meetings, world leaders sought policies to spur faster, more inclusive growth.
They would do well to move gender equality to the top of the list.
Closing the Political Gender Gap
WASHINGTON, DC – A record number of American women are running for elected office in 2018, many of them motivated by outrage over US President Donald Trump’s policies and attitudes.
But running is not winning, and outrage alone cannot produce the kind of steady progress needed to achieve political equality.
To produce a substantial increase in the number of women in Congress, changes that run deeper than the current electoral “pink wave” will be needed.
With only 19.3% female representation in the House of Representatives and 23% in the Senate, the United States currently ranks 103rd in the world in terms of women’s representation in national legislatures.
To improve its record, the US should look to countries with greater gender parity.
At the top of that list is Rwanda, where women make up 61.3% of the lower house and 38.5% of the upper house.
In 2003, the country adopted a new constitution that reserves 30% of parliamentary seats for women and requires political parties to ensure that women hold at least 30% of elected internal positions.
France is one of 49 other countries that also have statutory quotas or reserved seats for women.
Such quotas may, however, be unnecessary.
In seven of the top ten countries for female representation, political parties have voluntarily implemented their own rules on the matter.
Globally, over 100 political parties in 53 countries have voluntary measures in place to increase the number of women candidates and party officials.
But, legislated or not, quotas can be controversial.
Some claim that they are undemocratic.
There is no doubt that they are a blunt instrument.
Can we do better?
A more nuanced approach would focus on eliminating the underlying, interconnected barriers that women face in getting nominated for elected office and conducting successful campaigns.
Such obstacles include the election system itself (women fare better under proportional representation than they do in first-past-the-post systems based on single-member districts); lack of access to financing; weaker professional networks; and outside responsibilities that make it harder to take on punishing and unpredictable working conditions.
Overcoming such structural barriers requires a comprehensive strategy for supporting women candidates.
One of the most powerful tools is money.
In many countries, the cost of campaigning is becoming prohibitively high for most aspirants, regardless of gender.
But women seem to have it worse than men.
In a 2008 survey of 292 parliamentarians around the world, the Inter-Parliamentary Union found that female MPs viewed lack of finance as a more significant deterrent to entering politics than their male counterparts did.
This problem is particularly pronounced in the US, where parties and candidates can spend almost unlimited amounts to get elected.
Wealthy candidates (usually men) finance their own campaigns, with some women, such as Nancy Pelosi and Dianne Feinstein, relying on their husbands’ fortunes.
Overall, this system disadvantages women.
Fortunately, some countries are introducing innovative measures to address this problem.
In Georgia, for example, political parties that include at least 30% of each gender on their electoral lists receive a 30% supplement from the state budget.
Similarly, in Ireland, political parties lose 50% of their state funding if their candidate pool includes less than 30% of either gender.
Beyond financing constraints, women face high social and cultural barriers to political participation.
In particular, greater care obligations, reinforced by public perceptions of a “woman’s role,” severely undermine women’s ability to run for public office.
These issues are difficult to address directly.
One step that could help would be for male politicians to assume more care responsibilities, thereby making the playing field more level, while demonstrating that family is a high priority for everyone.
Likewise, new mothers should be able to bring their children to work.
In 2015, a photo of Argentinian MP Victoria Donda Pérez breastfeeding while taking part in a parliamentary hearing went viral, as it demonstrated the commitment, capabilities, and challenges of working mothers.
Such challenges were exemplified by the experience of Madeleine Henfling, a member of Germany’s Thuringia state parliament, who last month was barred from entering the legislative chamber with her six-week-old baby.
Concrete policies should also be put in place to support working parents, by giving them more flexibility to meet family responsibilities.
That is why the United Kingdom’s House of Commons is considering introducing proxy voting, as part of a broader effort to give members – male and female – parental leave.
Women may also benefit from targeted training.
UN Women’s recent Political Academy in Tunisia trained women candidates on local governance, the missions and roles of municipal councils, and media relations.
Some may one day follow in the footsteps of Souad Abderrahim, who was elected the first woman mayor of Tunis with the support of the Islamist Ennahda Movement.
Some leaders have made powerful statements in support of greater female participation in government.
In 2015, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave his country its first cabinet with an equal number of men and women.
His Spanish counterpart Pedro Sánchez has gone a step further, appointing a cabinet where women outnumber men.
Political parties, which serve as gatekeepers for aspirants to public office, also have significant power to find creative ways to support women candidates.
Nigeria’s two main parties, for example, will waive or reduce non-refundable nomination fees for the 2019 general election.
One Cambodian party provides women candidates with basic campaign resources, including clothing and a bicycle.
In past Canadian elections, political parties have reimbursed women candidates for child-care and travel expenses, and provided subsidies to women seeking nomination in constituencies where a male incumbent is retiring.
The New Democratic Party and Liberal Party have endeavored to have women candidates run for “winnable” open seats.
There is no one-size-fits-all solution to gender inequality in politics.
But there is plenty that can – and should – be done to ensure that women’s voices are heard.
Training for Gender Equality
MUSCAT – For centuries, women around the world have struggled for even the most basic rights.
The fight for equality has been an uphill climb – one that is far from over.
This is certainly the case in the Middle East, where the challenges women face are typically rooted in social norms, cultural systems, and religious doctrine, and can be enshrined in law.
In some Middle Eastern countries, women may not travel, work, or register to vote without permission from a man in her family.
Even if it is not explicitly prohibited, joining the workforce is often very difficult for women, not least because of widespread resistance among the men who dominate these societies.
Any woman who has sought to apply for a job knows just how vehement that opposition can be.
The result of these norms and structures is that women in the Middle East are often subject to discrimination, isolation, and frustration.
They are unable to participate freely in their societies or contribute to their countries’ economic development.
But the world is changing fast.
At a time of ever-deepening interconnectedness, people are more aware than ever of what is possible, and more motivated than ever to seek reforms – whether educational, economic, or political – that improve their lives.
So which reforms are needed to advance gender equality?
A central area of focus must be education.
First and foremost, schools give girls the knowledge they need to fulfill their potential in the future.
But it is also vital to instill in both girls and boys an understanding of the need for social and economic equality, to reflect the fundamental equality of opportunity that all deserve.
Advancing gender equality also requires changes to policies and regulations.
Beyond ensuring equal rights under the law, countries should work to boost the representation of women in politics and government.
Women need to know that they can reach positions of genuine authority, even in domains from which they have historically been excluded – and they need encouragement to get there.
The same is true for the economy.
Women need opportunities and support to develop and run their own businesses, to innovate, and to become financially independent.
This would benefit not only women, but also their families, communities, and the economy as a whole.
Even women who do not own or run businesses would have much to offer, if given the chance to enter the workforce and earn their own living.
To this end, training is crucial.
Women need access to guidance, workshops, and longer-term training programs that prepare them to participate in the labor market, while ensuring that they know – and can defend – their rights.
An important initiative that could provide a useful model for such efforts is the Springboard Women’s Development Programme, developed by the British Council.
The program aims to give women the confidence and capabilities they need to make a better life for themselves, both professionally and personally; to expand their role and influence in public life; and to help support open, stable, and inclusive societies across the Middle East and North Africa.
The key to the program’s success is its focus on empowering women to fulfill their potential.
It helps participants explore and develop their abilities, and then apply them in practical settings, such as acquiring funding to start or expand their own businesses.
It also prepares women to confront – and overcome – the obstacles they will inevitably face as they gain independence and influence.
Delivered by a network of licensed trainers, the Springboard Women’s Development Programme has already been used by over 230,000 women in more than 40 countries.
In just four years, the program has trained more than 700 women in my country, Oman, through the Ministry of Education.
And many more women are clamoring to participate.
Achieving gender equality in the Middle East will be a long process, requiring fundamental educational, social, and economic reforms.
But giving women the right training now can kick-start the process, enabling half the population finally to reach their potential – to the benefit of all.
Gender Equality and Earth's Future
NEW YORK – Twenty years ago, the adoption by 189 governments of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action marked a turning point in the history of women's rights.
This progressive blueprint remains a powerful source of inspiration in the effort to realize equal opportunities for women and girls.
But while much progress has been made in the intervening decades, much more remains to be done to ensure that women and children are guaranteed healthy lives, education, and full social inclusion.
In just 42 countries do women hold more than 30% of seats in the national legislature, and girls still do not have the same educational opportunities as boys in Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, and western Asia.
Gender equality is not just the concern of half of the world's population; it is a human right, a concern for us all, because no society can develop – economically, politically, or socially – when half of its population is marginalized. We must leave no one behind.
This is a year of global action.
Governments will adopt a new set of Sustainable Development Goals, work together to draft a meaningful climate agreement, and craft a framework to provide the financial resources needed to deliver on a global sustainable development agenda.
Those participating would be wise to remember that inclusive sustainable development can be realized only when all human rights – including gender equality – are protected, respected, and fulfilled.
The three of us – each from different continents – support these international processes.
We share a common motivation for our work: protecting our planet for our children and grandchildren, and ensuring the development of a world where all people – regardless of their gender, race, religion, age, disability, or sexual orientation – have an equal opportunity to achieve their aspirations.
It is critical that we continue to engage men and boys actively in the fight against gender-based discrimination and violence.
We have an opportunity to secure a better future and raise a new generation of girls and boys who respect one another and work together to protect the rights of all people.
The implications of not providing girls with equal voices, choices, and opportunities affect not just their lives, but the future of the planet.
Efforts to promote inclusive sustainable development and fight climate change are inextricably linked.
If we care about development, we must care about the consequences our greenhouse-gas emissions are having around the world.
And if we do not take urgent action, we will irreparably damage the natural systems on which life depends.
This is not a threat that we can set aside until we have eradicated poverty worldwide.
Nor is it a problem that we can leave to future generations to address.
Left unchecked, climate change – along with other unsustainable patterns of development – could wipe out the gains of recent decades.
All countries – developed and developing – have a role to play in ensuring a stable world for our children.
Women are among those most vulnerable to the impacts of unsustainable practices and climate change, because they often have no independent income or land rights.
In many countries, women are responsible for the provision of water and food for their families.
And when the usual sources of these resources are disrupted, women are forced to travel farther and spend more time working for less return.
Scarcity requires them to make difficult choices like pulling children out of school or deciding which family member can afford to skip a meal.
In many homes around the world, women are at the heart of the household's nexus of water, food, and energy – and thus often know firsthand about the challenges and potential solutions in these areas.
In our conversations with women around the world, we hear about their struggles, but also their ideas, many of which, if applied, could facilitate change.
Women are the most convincing advocates for the solutions that they need, so they should be at the forefront of decision-making on sustainable development and climate-change mitigation.
Over the coming weeks, during the 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in New York, the international community will take stock of the progress that has been made toward achieving what was pledged 20 years ago in Beijing and assess where more efforts are needed.
This year will be crucial.
With the Financing for Development conference in July, the Special Summit on Sustainable Development Goals in September, and the UN Climate Change Conference in December, we have the opportunity to integrate gender equality and women's empowerment fully into the effort to promote sustainable development and fight climate change.
The three of us wake up every morning thinking about how to make this happen.
Everyone should.
We call on all women and men to join us in making their voices heard loudly and in seizing this opportunity for a just and equitable future for all.
Gender and the Arab City
BEIRUT – One of the top priorities for the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda is to make cities “inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.”
City leaders can take a simple step that would go long a way toward achieving this goal: putting the needs of women and girls at the center of the urban planning process.
By 2030, the majority of the world’s population will live in urban areas.
And yet, while increased urbanization – and the economic access, mobility, and greater autonomy that accompanies it – will generate new opportunities for women, ensuring gender equality will also become more difficult.
This concern is especially relevant to the Arab world.
In many Arab communities, urban space is, by default, male space.
Men act as if they “own” the street, which is reflected in how they walk and how they treat women in public.
In many Arab cities, as is true elsewhere, men are also far more likely than women to litter, reinforcing the perception that men consider public spaces to be their personal property.
The irony is that the Arab “street” has long been a stage for feminist progress.
Even before Arab women raised their voices during the 2011 Arab Spring, urban spaces played host to feminist protests and served as a political barometer for the rest of society.
But urban feminism is not widely studied by city planners in the Arab world.
Awareness of how public space in Arab cities is gendered is rare, and little information has been collected on how women affect – or are affected by – planning decisions.
Without a deeper understanding of the socio-spatial needs of Arab women, the region’s streets will remain the domain of men.
While sexual harassment is common in Arab cities, attention to gendered urban space is not only about safety.
Although many women in Arab cities do risk verbal and physical abuse when they are in public, they must also contend with issues like poor sanitation, limited access to toilets and clean water, and little privacy.
Marginalized groups – like migrants, ethnic and religious minorities, young girls, elderly women, and the disabled – are particularly vulnerable to discrimination.
Solutions, therefore, must consider the full range of social and cultural challenges that prevent women and girls from moving freely in urban settings.
To help cities in the Arab region progress toward greater inclusivity, governments should focus on four key reforms.
For starters, city planners should cooperate with women’s groups to conduct safety audits and map high-risk areas.
By analyzing crime data, for example, planners could determine where to focus improvements such as better lighting and additional policing.
When women’s organizations are involved in these types of decisions, cities become safer for women, which in turn improves their access to social, economic, cultural, and political opportunities.
Next, education systems must be reconfigured to encourage more women and girls to pursue careers in architecture, planning, and urban design.
In most Arab cities, planning processes are inaccessible to much of the population; they are even less accessible to women.
To change the patriarchal status quo, we must encourage more young women to enter these fields, and to design modern spaces that are sensitive to women’s needs.
Third, cities need standardized methods for measuring women’s rights in urban environments.
One way to achieve this would be to establish scoring systems created by and for women; surveys could include questions about legal frameworks, engagement in urban planning decision-making, public transportation habits, and views on housing, recreation, and safety.
Finally, urban planners must rethink how they fill public spaces.
Consider, for example, historic statues; in many cities, only men are lionized in bronze.
Why not women?
If gender equality was a criterion in commissioning public art, young women and men would grow up knowing that their city was a place where everyone is honored, protected, and respected.
Urban planning is never gender-neutral, and leaders in Arab cities, in particular, must work hard to account for all residents’ views and desires.
For women and girls, requirements include safe streets, well-maintained public facilities, and gender-specific amenities – such as nursing rooms for mothers.
In a truly safe city, everyone’s rights are considered, everyone can access public spaces, and everyone is involved in the planning process.
If planners consistently applied such principles to their work, the Arab city would naturally become a catalyst for female empowerment.
And when cities become engines of opportunity for women, everyone benefits.
The Working Women Windfall
MUMBAI – Narrowing the global gender gap would have huge potential economic benefits.
According to the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), if every government helped its citizens catch up to the country in its region that has made the fastest strides toward gender parity, the total annual payoff in additional GDP could reach $12 trillion in 2025.
Gender parity is also a moral imperative, recognized in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were adopted by 193 countries in 2015.
Together with the aggregate economic payoff, investing in women and girls would transform millions of lives for the better.
The question, then, is how to realize these enormous gains.
Achieving economic gender equality is not possible without working toward social gender equality.
The two need to be tackled together.
An important part of the answer, it turns out, lies in improving access to essential services such as education and family planning.
MGI estimates that the additional annual investment required to deliver essential services to those who need them is between $1.5-2 trillion in 2025.
This compares with estimated spending of $6.3 trillion on these services in 2014.
In other words, the potential economic payoff in 2025 would be 6-8 times the spending required.
In six areas – education, family planning, maternal health, financial inclusion, digital inclusion, and assistance with unpaid care work – improved access to services could unlock women’s economic potential and help to meet the SDGs’ gender-equality targets.
Assistance with unpaid care work represents one the biggest opportunities for improvement worldwide, but there is broad scope for improvement in financial and digital inclusion in South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa is greatly in need of advances in maternal health.
In order to meet the path set by the SDGs, 58 million more girls and 60 million more boys will need to be enrolled in schools.
Some 224 million more women will need to gain access to formal financial services to close the gender gap completely.
And roughly 445 million people will need improved access to safe water supplies – part of reducing the unpaid care work carried out by women in developing countries.
This ambitious agenda will not be delivered effectively without action from governments working in concert with the private sector and nongovernmental organizations.
It will require additional investment, the creation of job opportunities for women, and the introduction of measures to help women move into more productive work.
MGI identified several interventions around the world that could easily be deployed more broadly.
Measures proven to improve access to education include building more secondary schools, ensuring that girls are provided with sanitation facilities in the places where they study, and creating financial incentives – including cash transfers – to raise enrollment and keep girls in school.
When it comes to family planning and maternal health, the main priorities are to expand the number of health workers and develop emergency services and maternal-health services in rural areas.
Improving supply chains for the delivery of contraceptives and expanding sex education in schools are also important measures.
One of the most effective ways to reduce the amount of time women spend on unpaid care work is expanding the provision of childcare, whether government-subsidized, employer-assisted, or self-funded.
Digital technologies can help more women gain access to financial services, but only if countries expand their infrastructure and help enhance women’s digital and financial literacy.
These measures will, of course, have to be funded; but MGI has found that 60% of countries can generate the additional funds from taxes on the incremental GDP growth that empowering women will deliver.
In places where such tax revenues may not be sufficient, private investment can be attracted.
Legislation enacted this year by New York State, for example, requires that employers and employees each contribute funds to finance paid family leave.
But policy changes will be insufficient if attitudes prevent people from making use of new rights and services.
Even in Sweden, where gender equality has advanced very far, studies suggest that roughly 33% of men take parental leave, compared to more than 75% of women.
To be sure, participation in paid work or domestic work is ultimately a matter of personal choice, but social attitudes may need to be addressed if they hinder true freedom to decide.
There are grounds for optimism.
Many developing countries, including India, are now at a tipping point, with sharply narrowing gender gaps in education implying huge potential gains in women’s economic prospects.
In the United States, New York is not alone in adopting policies enabling paid family leave.
And the rapid spread of digital technologies is improving access to finance and work opportunities in completely new ways.
Finally, awareness of the immense economic benefits of tackling gender inequality is increasing.
We have a $12-trillion incentive to accelerate progress.
The Perils of Planned Extinctions
HONOLULU – A cynical move is underway to promote a new, powerful, and troubling technology known as “gene drives” for use in conservation.
This is not just your everyday genetic modification, known as “GMO”; it is a radical new technology, which creates “mutagenic chain reactions” that can reshape living systems in unimaginable ways.
Gene drives represent the next frontier of genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and gene editing.
The technology overrides the standard rules of genetic inheritance, ensuring that a particular trait, delivered by humans into an organism’s DNA using advanced gene-editing technology, spreads to all subsequent generations, thereby altering the future of the entire species.
It is a biological tool with unprecedented power.
Yet, instead of taking time to consider fully the relevant ethical, ecological, and social issues, many are aggressively promoting gene-drive technology for use in conservation.
One proposal aims to protect native birds on Hawaii’s Kauai Island by using gene drives to reduce the population of a species of mosquito that carries avian malaria.
Another plan, championed by a conservation consortium that includes US and Australian government agencies, would eradicate invasive, bird-harming mice on particular islands by introducing altered mice that prevent them from producing female offspring.
Creating the “daughterless mouse” would be the first step toward so-called Genetic Biocontrol of Invasive Rodents (GBIRd), designed to cause deliberate extinctions of “pest” species like rats, in order to save “favored” species, such as endangered birds.
The assumption underlying these proposals seems to be that humans have the knowledge, capabilities, and prudence to control nature.
The idea that we can – and should – use human-driven extinction to address human-caused extinction is appalling.
I am not alone in my concern.
At the ongoing International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Conservation Congress in Hawaii, a group of leading conservationists and scientists issued an open letter, entitled “A Call for Conservation with a Conscience,” demanding a halt to the use of gene drives in conservation.
I am one of the signatories, along with the environmental icon David Suzuki, physicist Fritjof Capra, the Indigenous Environmental Network’s Tom Goldtooth, and organic pioneer Nell Newman.
The discussions that have begun at the IUCN congress will continue at the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in Mexico this December, when global leaders must consider a proposed global moratorium on gene drives.
Such discussions reflect demands by civil-society leaders for a more thorough consideration of the scientific, moral, and legal issues concerning the use of gene drives.
As I see it, we are simply not asking the right questions.
Our technological prowess is largely viewed through the lens of engineering, and engineers tend to focus on one question: “Does it work?”
But, as Angelika Hilbeck, President of the European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility (ENSSER) argues, a better question would be: “What else does it do?”
When it comes to the GBIRd project, for example, one might ask whether the “daughterless mouse” could escape the specific ecosystem into which it has been introduced, just as GMO crops and farmed salmon do, and what would happen if it did.
As for the mosquitos in Hawaii, one might ask how reducing their numbers would affect the endangered hoary bat species.
Ensuring that these kinds of questions are taken into account will be no easy feat.
As a lawyer experienced in US government regulations, I can confidently say that the existing regulatory framework is utterly incapable of assessing and governing gene-drive technology.
Making matters worse, the media have consistently failed to educate the public about the risks raised by genetic technologies.
Few people understand that, as MIT science historian Lily Kay explains, genetic engineering was deliberately developed and promoted as a tool for biological and social control.
Those driving that process were aiming to fulfill a perceived mandate for “science-based social intervention.”
Powerful tools like genetic modification and, especially, gene-drive technology spark the imagination of anyone with an agenda, from the military (which could use them to make game-changing bio-weapons) to well-intentioned health advocates (which could use them to help eradicate certain deadly diseases).
They certainly appeal to the hero narrative that so many of my fellow environmentalists favor.
But the fact is that we have not created the intellectual infrastructure to address the fundamental challenges that gene drives – not to mention other powerful technologies – raise.
And now we are supposed to suspend our critical faculties and trust the techno-elites’ promise to use gene drives responsibly in the service of seemingly positive environmental goals.
No open public discussion is needed, apparently.
But why should we blindly believe that everything is under control?
In my view, the focus on using gene-drive technology for conservation is a ruse to gain public acceptance and regulatory cover.
Why expose something to public scrutiny and possible restraints when you can usher it in through the back door by pretending it will do some good?
The risks are too obvious for gene-drive advocates to risk talking about them.
In my 20-plus years of researching and reporting on transgenic technologies, I thought I had seen the worst of the false promises and hype that they engender.
But gene drives are unlike anything we have witnessed, and amount to the ultimate test of our self-control.
Can we really trust science to guide us, or do we recklessly throw in our lot with technological “silver bullets” as the way forward?
Fortunately, we still have a choice.
The fact that gene drives can change the basic relationship between humanity and the natural world is both a challenge and an opportunity.
We can do now what we should have done a long time ago, with regard to both nuclear and transgenic technologies: start paying more attention to the dangers of human ingenuity – and more respect to the genius of nature.
Belly-Up Brazil?
SAO PAULO – After years of impressive growth, Brazil’s economic prospects appear increasingly dim.
Since the World Cup ended in July, economic activity has plummeted, inflationary pressures have intensified, and consumer and business confidence have collapsed, leading many economists to slash their growth forecasts for this year.
So just how sick is Brazil’s economy, and how will its malaise affect the outcome of the presidential election in October?
At first glance, Brazil’s weak growth appears ephemeral, and President Dilma Rousseff should be well positioned to win a second term.
Over the last 12 years, her Worker’s Party (PT) has delivered the country’s strongest per capita GDP growth in more than three decades; reduced income inequality with an extensive system of social transfers that reaches one-third of Brazilian households; and reduced formal unemployment to a record-low 4.5%.
But even a cursory look at recent economic data reveals that Brazil’s growth model may well be hitting a stagflationary wall.
In fact, Brazil most likely experienced a technical recession during the first half of this year.
And annual growth during Rousseff’s presidency has probably averaged less than 2% – the slowest for any Brazilian president since the 1980s, when the country began its transition from hyperinflationary basket case and serial defaulter to stable and increasingly prosperous middle-income economy.
Moreover, had the government not cut taxes and delayed much-needed increases in gasoline and electricity prices, average annual inflation would stand at 7.5% – a level not reached in decades.
In services, where the government has taken no measures to suppress inflation, the rate exceeds 9%.
Dig deeper, and one finds that the economy’s foundations are plagued with fragilities and imbalances.
Though overall economic activity is weak, the current-account deficit has reached a 12-year high of 3.5% of GDP.
Industrial production is 7% below its pre-crisis peak in 2008.
This, together with the decline in manufactured goods as a share of total exports, from 54% a decade ago to 37% today, points to a substantial loss of competitiveness.
Even the economy’s apparent strengths – a thriving service sector and low unemployment – rest on unsustainable credit policies.
Of course, rapid credit growth is a natural consequence of declining real interest rates.
But, in Brazil, lending by state-owned banks has outpaced that of private banks significantly since 2008, meaning that lending at deeply subsidized rates has largely driven the increase in bank credit, to 58% of GDP (roughly double the rate eight years ago).
Against this background, Brazil is preparing for its most important presidential election since its transition from dictatorship to democracy in 1985 – and the polls do not bode well for Rousseff.
Despite higher incomes and lower inequality, 70% of Brazilians have expressed a desire for change.
This is not surprising, in view of the street protests that erupted last year over the poor quality of public services and rising prices.
But is Rousseff’s government entirely to blame?
The short answer is no.
While Rousseff’s government is largely responsible for the recent bout of cyclical weakness and social upheaval, Brazil’s problems are rooted in a broader unwillingness to shake off the yoke of policies adopted during more than two decades of military rule.
The 1994 Plano Real, a macroeconomic stabilization program, together with subsequent structural reforms, enabled Brazil finally to quash inflation and ride a wave of cheap global liquidity and surging Chinese demand for commodities.
As the government attempted to direct these gains toward wealth redistribution, public expenditure rose and the social-benefits system – underpinned by so-called “acquired rights” – became increasingly rigid.
Brazil needs a new growth model, based on four key elements: tighter fiscal policy, looser monetary policy, a reduced role for state-owned banks in credit provision, and measures to lower Brazil’s astronomical private lending costs.
The next government, whether of the left or the right, will also face the unenviable task of reforming the acquired-rights system to make social benefits more flexible and affordable.
Its approach will determine whether Brazil goes the way of Venezuela, which is currently mired in stagflation, or Chile, widely regarded as Latin America’s best-run economy.
Given the protections afforded to acquired rights, the process of rooting out economic distortions and restoring Brazil’s finances to a stable equilibrium will require a lengthy process of constitutional reform.
And, though the transition will undoubtedly be painful, it is essential to Brazil’s future economic growth and development.
Whether or not the next government can do what is needed will depend on its ability to unify the electorate and a disparate group of regionally focused political parties.
But, first, it must reject the temptingly easy – but ultimately damaging – route of raising taxes and doubling down on redistributive policies.
That path leads to Venezuela – and to a far less stable and prosperous Latin America.
Self-Insurance or Self-Destruction?
NEW DELHI – Though the US Federal Reserve is turning a blind eye to the spillover effects of its monetary policy, the rest of the world is worrying about the impact that capital-flow reversals will have on emerging economies.
Will the foreign reserves that these countries have built up in recent years prove adequate to protect their financial systems, as liquidity flows back toward developed economies?
The short answer is no, because excessive self-insurance ultimately does more harm than good.
In order to break the destabilizing cycle of short-term capital flows and excessive accumulation of foreign reserves, the International Monetary Fund, with broad support from the G-20, must devise new rules regarding monetary-policy spillovers.
Severe crises leave an imprint on a nation’s psyche.
In the late 1990’s, the currency and banking crises that ravaged Asian economies led the affected countries’ leaders to a simple conclusion: no amount of insurance was too much.
Although the introduction of floating exchange rates removed the incentive to borrow in a foreign currency (and thus the need for self-insurance), the political humiliation of losing sovereignty to the IMF – if only temporarily – was so devastating that the economic costs of building a massive foreign-currency war chest seemed worthwhile.
But these countries’ leaders failed to grasp the full consequences.
Foreign-exchange reserve accumulation depresses the exchange rate, ostensibly as a smoothing device.
But stronger emerging-market currencies in the 2000’s would likely have led to earlier rebalancing toward domestic demand.
And if these countries had recycled a smaller stock of foreign reserves into US Treasuries, agency bonds, and subprime securities, US interest rates would likely have remained higher, emerging-market current-account surpluses would have declined earlier, and advanced-economy deficits would have contracted, thereby restoring some semblance of equilibrium.
But, of course, that is not what happened – to the detriment of global financial stability.
Furthermore, the accumulation of self-insurance can beget competition similar to an arms race.
Whether to prevent the appearance of inadequate insurance or to avoid losing export share, sizable interventions in currency markets became widely accepted among Asia’s emerging economies as a natural response to large capital inflows – directly contradicting these countries’ commitments to floating exchange rates.
Given that persistent currency intervention reduced volatility, it encouraged ever-larger capital inflows, under the presumption of less risk.
At the same time, the currencies of countries that chose not to intervene became targets of speculative inflows, owing to the expectation that they would appreciate.In other words, spillovers occurred not only between advanced and emerging economies, but also among emerging economies.
Nonetheless, countries like South Africa and Mexico – both of which chose to forego intervention – did better, in many ways, than their intervention-happy counterparts.
Both suffered little financial fallout from the currency weakness that followed the Fed’s announcement last May that it would “taper” its purchases of long-term assets.
Truly floating exchange rates generally served their purposes: removing the incentive to accumulate external debt, encouraging flexibility within the real economy, and promoting the development of deep and liquid capital markets.
Another consequence of self-insurance is rooted in the ostensibly laudable goal of preserving national sovereignty.
Specifically, governments may be tempted, especially around election time, to use self-insurance as a substitute for adjustment, rather than to help cushion the impact of a shock or support economic rebalancing.
The alternative – “renting” insurance from multilateral bodies like the IMF – would demand fulfillment of certain reform obligations.
The fact is that emerging economies’ self-insurance policies, like the Fed’s ultra-loose monetary policy, fuel a reflexive feedback loop.
While any suggestion that countries cede monetary-policy independence would be foolhardy, some rules are clearly needed to limit spillovers – rules that should come from a revamped IMF, with the US Congress demonstrating its support through a long-overdue quota increase.
Specifically, the IMF should be responsible for assessing spillovers and mobilizing liquidity support for vulnerable economies accordingly, either through central-bank currency-swap lines or IMF liquidity facilities.
Such multilateral insurance would lessen the need for self-insurance, without impinging on countries’ sovereignty.
To be sure, such rules would not insulate economies entirely from monetary-policy spillovers, which are an inescapable element of an economy’s adjustment process.
But they would help to mitigate the kind of tail risks that have plagued the financial system over the last two decades.
Only with a well-defined mechanism for managing spillovers can the vicious cycle of capital-flow volatility and excessive self-insurance accumulation finally be broken.
China’s Bad Dream
LONDON – Since his first address as China’s president last year, Xi Jinping has been espousing the so-called “Chinese Dream” of national rejuvenation and individual self-improvement.
But the imperative of addressing the unprecedented amount of debt that China has accumulated in recent years is testing Xi’s resolve – and his government is blinking.
The Chinese government’s uncertain ability – or willingness – to rein in debt is apparent in its contradictory commitment to implement major structural reforms while maintaining 7.5% annual GDP growth.
Given that China owes much of its recent growth to debt-financed investment – often in projects like infrastructure and housing, meant to support the Chinese Dream – any effort to get credit growth under control is likely to cause a hard landing.
This prospect is already prompting the authorities to delay critical reforms.
To be sure, China’s debt/GDP ratio, reaching 250% this month, remains significantly lower than that of most developed economies.
The problem is that China’s stock of private credit would normally be associated with a per capita GDP of around $25,000 – almost four times the country’s current level.
There are strong parallels between China’s current predicament and the investment boom that Japan experienced in the 1980s.
Like China today, Japan had a high personal savings rate, which enabled investors to rely heavily on traditional, domestically financed bank loans.
Moreover, deep financial linkages among sectors amplified the potential fallout of financial risk.
And Japan’s external position was strong, just as China’s is now.
Another similarity is the accumulation of debt within the corporate sector.
Corporate leverage in China rose from 2.4 times equity in 2007 to 3.5 times last year – well above American and European levels.
Nearly half of this debt matures within one year, even though much of it is being used to finance multi-year infrastructure projects.
Making matters worse, much of the new credit has originated in the shadow-banking sector at high interest rates, causing borrowers’ repayment capacity to become overstretched.
One in five listed corporations carries gross leverage of more than eight times equity and earns less than two times interest coverage, weakening considerably these companies’ resilience to growth shocks.
To be sure, China’s situation is more extreme than Japan’s.
At its peak, Japanese investment stood at 33% of GDP, compared to 47% in China.
This is a substantial difference, especially considering that China’s per capita GDP amounts to only 19% of Japan’s at its highest level, and that its debt has already reached 60% of Japan’s.
Moreover, the accumulation of debt in China – 71 percentage points of GDP over the last five years – has been far sharper than in Japan, where the debt level grew by only 16 percentage points over the five-year period before its bust.
That is all the more reason to believe that Japan’s experience can provide important insight into the risks that China faces.
After Japan’s bubble burst, annual GDP growth, which averaged 5.8% in the four years preceding the bust, plummeted to 0.9% for the next four years.
With bad debt left to fester on banks’ balance sheets, growth vanished and deflation set in.
While private debt as a share of GDP stabilized, public debt increased by 50% in the five years after the bust.
The collapse of China’s credit bubble would likely cause annual GDP growth to drop to 1-2%, on average, for the subsequent four years, assuming a 2% annual decline in capital expenditure and a still-respectable consumption-growth rate of 3-5%.
Consolidated public-sector debt would rise to 100% of GDP.
This is a relatively modest prediction.
Without automatic stabilizers or a strong financial-stability framework underpinned by deposit insurance, coping with the downside risks of the potentially destabilizing financial reforms that the government is pursuing will be difficult enough; a credit shock could prove disastrous.
China’s debt tipping point is to be found in its massive real-estate bubble.
According to the investment bank UBS, new urban housing supply has far exceeded marginal underlying demand from urban population growth.
Indeed, almost half of the formal increase is not an increase at all, but merely recognition of rural workers who have been living and working in cities for some time.
The impact of a sharp decline in real-estate prices would be far-reaching.
After all, property collateral is the bedrock of the Chinese financial system, with estimates of banks’ direct and indirect exposure to real estate ranging from 66% to 89% of GDP.
Complicating matters further is the government’s lack of options for stabilizing property markets.
In fact, a key part of the problem is that China’s response to cyclical weakness always entails more housing construction.
China’s lack of automatic stabilizers places the tension between reform objectives and growth imperatives in sharp relief.
The only way for the government to shore up growth in the short run is to pursue more debt-driven stimulus, as it did earlier this year.
But this will also cause China’s debt burden to continue to grow, with bad debt increasingly crowding out good credit.
If China’s leaders continue to choose debt-fueled growth over reform, they will only delay, and possibly prolong, the inevitable slowdown.
That would turn Xi’s Chinese Dream into a more elusive prospect.
Gene Pool Rules
CLEVELAND – For thousands of years, humans have used genetic engineering to control the evolution of plants and animals.
So it is inevitable that we will use it to shape our own evolution.
Our efforts so far have been modest: online dating services are beginning to match subscribers on the basis of their genetic compatibility; parents increasingly screen embryos and fetuses, allowing only those with the healthiest genes to be born; geneticists are only slowly improving their ability to manipulate DNA directly; and no one is trying to make germline changes in humans that will be passed on to succeeding generations.
Full-scale human evolutionary engineering is still far off, but, at some point in the future, it may well become routine.
The challenge for humanity is twofold: to survive long enough to reach that point, and to cause the least amount of harm while getting there.
Those most immediately at risk are children, who are in danger of having their genetic material manipulated in damaging ways.
The harm can be physical (stillbirths, deformities, and genetic disorders); but, even genetic engineering that is technically successful can cause psychosocial harm to children, who may be shunned by peers for being odd-looking or merely “different.”
On a societal level, genetic engineering that only the wealthy can afford would threaten social cohesion by ruling out equality of opportunity.
Genetic haves and have-nots could form separate castes, with reproductive isolation possibly producing physical changes that would make inter-caste procreation impossible.
Ultimately, this could lead to the emergence of distinct human species.
Given that no human species other than our own survives (Homo floresiensis disappeared about 18,000 years ago), the prospects for harmonious coexistence among future human species are not reassuring.
In the worst case, the human genetic lineage itself could be wiped out by inter-species conflict.
Even without speciation, the same outcome could occur through a loss of genetic diversity: If everyone selected the same traits for their offspring, their descendants would be incapable of surviving a sudden, unexpected environmental challenge.
Geneticists often express skepticism about such predictions.
For example, a reviewer of my recent book, writing in Science, pointed out how little impact “a few genetically engineered individuals” will have on the human gene pool.
But, while it is true that a genetic-engineering catastrophe will not overtake the entire human species anytime soon, existing genetic-engineering technologies already can harm individual children: witness the increase in premature births and low birth weights associated with in vitro fertilization.
And reproductive decisions that reflect a cultural preference for boys are beginning to produce social problems in countries like China and India.
Simply put, in the absence of unknown and unforeseeable technical impediments, human evolutionary engineering is likely to become sufficiently widespread in the future to pose species-wide threats.
